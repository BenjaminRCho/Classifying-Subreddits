0,NO ICO PROMOTION HERE - Immediately Removed,"Please to not promote your ICO here.  There are too many of them.  This forum is for links to articles pertaining to existing coins and digital currency news.  There are plenty of other appropriate places to promote your upcoming projects.

Also removed...

* Twitter Links

* Comments (instead of links to articles)

* Articles Pumping a Coin / Pump &amp; Dump Groups

* Foreign Language Articles (English Only Please)",gjsteele71,Crypto_Currency_News
1,Sticky Rules - Please Read &amp; Follow,"There are already Reddits for each of the Coins and Tokens. I don't want this to be another pumper's paradise, or a place for people to ask which wallet to use. I am going to be very strict on what is allowed to stay here when it comes to posts and comments.

This Subreddit is for recent articles or crypto related videos only. If you make a post, please link to where you found the news and be sure the title describes the article. Due to new accounts being created repeatedly and spamming ICOs, I have put a minimum account status of 5 Post Karma to add a link. If this does not work out like I want it to, I will adjust it.

Here are things I remove articles for...

* 1. Links to Twitter or Facebook or Images or short Reddit posts
* 2. Same article already posted in previous 24 hours by someone else
* 3. Crazy Price Predictions such as ""LTC Might Reach $1000 Next Year""
* 4. Price Announcements - Yes, we know the price of BTC
* 5. Incomplete or Inaccurate Title
* 6. Text Comments (instead of links)
* 7. Article Will Not Let Me Read Without Accepting Cookies or Ads
* 8. Articles about a coin being added to an exchange - nobody cares
* 9. POST TITLE IN ALL CAPS - that's annoying
* 10. Whatever does not fit, which may be influenced by my mood

Here are things I Ban for

* 1. Pump Group or Bot Ad Links or Phishing or Self Promotion
* 2. ICO or Airdrop Links or Giveaways
* 3. Non-Crypto Links
* 4. Foreign Language Links
* 5. Links repeatedly to articles already posted the same day
* 6. Low quality click bait links with flashy titles but no info

Maintaining the high standards is very time consuming, and I am quick with the ban hammer to keep from having to remove articles not meeting the rules day after day. I probably remove 1/3 of the posts here, mostly because the same news is posted over and over again. If you feel you have been unfairly banned please write me and explain.  I am quick to give second chances as well.

Thanks for reading!",SSpaid2,Crypto_Currency_News
