Amazon hits $1 trillion market value.
Amazon hits $1 trillion valuation  
8 Mins Ago | 00:54

Amazon market cap hit $1 trillion on Tuesday, becoming the second publicly traded U.S. company to reach the record valuation after Apple.

Shares of the e-commerce giant rose nearly 2 percent to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trading. The stock needed a price of $2,050.27 to reach the $1 trillion mark, based on an outstanding share count of 487,741,189 shares — according to the company's most recent quarterly report in July.

Apple reached $1 trillion in early August after posting a strong quarterly report. It took Amazon just five weeks to match the milestone.

The two Silicon Valley giants had been racing to the trillion-dollar finish line. Apple had a pretty significant head start,surpassing $900 billion in market value eight months before Amazon, which reached $900 billion in July on the heels of its biggest Prime Day ever.

Amazon stock has gained more than 70 percent in 2018 and has more than doubled in the last 12 months. That dwarfs gains by the overall market, with the S&amp;P 500 index gaining 8 percent this year and 16 percent in the last 12 months. 

How high will Amazon go, do you think?",gorillaz0e,stocks

5,Comparing this Nike/Kaepernick situation with situations from the past...,"Someone already brought up the idea of being long on Nike and posted it on here a couple hours ago. Predictably it devolved into political arguments pretty quickly, so I’d like to try something new here.

Regardless of how you feel about Nike’s decision I think that watching the market’s short term reaction will be pretty academic in terms of gauging the current attitudes of devoted investors around the country.

My question is can we come up with similar situations from the past and see how they trended? Personally, I would love an opportunity to buy a dip here, and getting a better sense of a timeline from previous events would be very beneficial.

The only thing I can think of off the top of my head is when Jemele Hill started back up at ESPN after her suspension. This is quite different because ESPN has become one of the most transparently liberal outlets around, and any effect would be kind of diluted because of the super diversified giant that is Disney.

8,Riding the TNDM wave,"Hi there,

Looking at 30% gains now on my holding in TNDM.

My worry is that they’re very overvalued and if a correction happens in t could be hit hard.

Is there significant value somewhere I’m not seeing by simply using DCF?

Thanks",-ninjasaurus-,stocks
9,Stocks are Slices of a Business,"I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard from other people that, “This ABC stock is cheap. It’s only $3,” or “There’s no way I’d buy that XYZ stock. $50 is too much.” What brought anyone to the conclusion that a $50 stock is too pricey or that a $3 stock is a bargain? 

If I had $5,000 to invest in one stock, I could buy $5,000 worth of ABC’s $3 stock or of XYZ’s $50 stock. The price by itself really makes no difference. The critical component is the price you pay relative to the value that you get.

Let me explain this concept with a pizza analogy. Let’s say that you’re going to grab lunch. You find a few food trucks nearby and decide that you’re going to get some pizza. You notice that there are two vendors selling pizza and they both appear to be selling some very appetizing food. Both give off a pleasant aroma of gourmet pizza, and both have comparable lines of customers. But then you realize that one truck is selling slices for $8 and the other truck is selling slices for $2. What do you do?

Let’s say that for the sake of this example that you choose the $2 slice thinking that you’re probably getting a bargain. You decide to get two slices because you saved so much money, and you’ve worked up an appetite so you’re starving. As you wait for your order you decide to scope out the other food truck. You take notice of the slices of pizza customers are being served and decide to make a comparison when you pick up your own food. But as you come up to get your order you make a strange realization. The two slices of $2 pizza is not even half the size of one of the $8 slices. It’s not even enough to fill your appetite and you’ve run out of time to buy food because it’s time to go back to work.

Where did you go wrong? The mistake you made was that you compared one price to another price. You forgot value in the equation! The right thing to do was to ask, “How big are the slices?”

The point I really want to get across here is that each stock has an underlying asset, a business. This business is like an entire pizza. There is value in this pie, earnings power, future growth, inventory, and other assets. And stocks are the little slices that make up the entire business pie. If we take every stock that was ever cut (issued)  from this “business pie” and multiply by the current price per share on the market, we would get the company’s “market capitalization” or “market cap” for short, the entire pie. Therefor if a $10 stock is a bargain and there are one million shares outstanding, then purchasing the entire business for $10 million is also a bargain ($10 x 1 million shares = $10 million.) Likewise if $1 billion dollars is a really lousy deal for a company with 1 billion shares then $1 for a share of that company is also a really lousy deal ($1 billion / 1 billion shares = $1.) Whoever got the idea that a tiny piece of a lousy deal was good and a big piece of a great deal was bad?

Valuation then becomes an issue of accounting for value within the business. And there are as many ways of producing value as there are as many ways of doing business. Some companies maintain durable brands, other companies own hidden tangible assets, still others have enormous earnings power or growth potential. But the common denominator that all these share is that they help produce earnings; this is the cheese, bread, and pepperoni, without it, we wouldn’t buy pizza. It is my hope that when you purchase your stocks, that you’ll have an understanding of what you’re buying and how much of it you’re getting.",dpod42,stocks

14,Marijuana Stocks question.,"Every marijuana stock I watch seems to go up a little or a lot doesn't matter the general trend is towards the positive.

They have some growing pains but everything looks pretty good. I checked out the stockhouse.com forum but that seems like a bunch of people circle jerking each other over how good of an investment they have made. Some of them are crying stock manipulation etc.
I don't have the experience trading to dissern that for myself. Wonder if there is something I am missing about this company.

31,Biotech write up: $AVMXY DD inside,"Lads, I've benefited quite a bit from multiple subs and wanted to give my two cents about a stock I see immense potential in(will put this elsewhere as well)

AVMXY is Avita medical. It's an Australian company listed as an OTC. Their claim to fame is a product called RECELL. 

What RECELL basically does is use a RES system which is regenerative epithelial suspension for burn victims. It is an autologous suspension that contains cells necessary to regenerate epidermis and provides a way to above closure if burn wounds. We all know burns aren't going away anytime soon and be seen in anyone from combat victims to fire victims or car accidents. Their product mainly comes into play for third degree burns and sometimes in second degree burns where skin grafting may be needed(taking skin from one part of the body and placing it on another). They did a multi centered randomized  controlled trial which was published which showed that patients who got their product RECELL essentially :
- required 97% less skin graft than those who did not
- had possible faster wound healing
- had less pain during recovery (burns are obv painful)

This is huge and potentially transformative for the burns industry. It is not currently approved but it's PMA application is currently being reviewed by the FDA and a decision is likely in Q3. The company is very confident that this will be approved and has already started production. Earlier in the year the FDA approved an increase in the number of patients who could be treated with RECELL under its compassionate use of investigational decide exemption program(basically allowing experimental therapy in extreme cases). They thus used it on 108 patients.this and its study results almost guarantees approval of the product which will be huge.

Imagine every burn center carrying Recell if it is approved. That's big.

I see one of a few possibilities:
-it gets listed on NASDAQ
- it gets bought out by another company
- nothing happens and it loses steam

I think the third is very unlikely given how this product can change management of burns. The first two possibilities are likely. It is currently $1.47/share which is still cheap. I can't predict how high it'll go but I do see an upward trajectory.

Constraints:
It is an OTC stock and these entail more risk than other stocks since they aren't as ""vetted."" That being said, they have already started in Europe and china so that's a good sign.
Also, interestingly it's been very quiet. Other than a couple of people mentioning it before, I haven't really seen it ""take off"" on Reddit. I believe mainly coz it's an OTC.

I see big things for AVMXY and I just bought quite a bit over the last week. FYI I am not trying to shamelessly promote this. I'm trying to give my two cents as DD and if you guys like please research the stock, company and the medical evidence. Don't buy just coz I said so.

34,Feeling of greediness and fear of missing out.,"November 2017 I out of curiosity looked up some stocks and charts and set it to 'YTD' and I was amazed at how many stocks had gotten 40%+ gains in just 10-11 months. Here I was thinking I'd be happy with a 4% time deposit but couldn't find any that high. Got my finances lined up to start investing in stocks, I couldn't believe even from November 2017 to January 2018 I had missed out on so many gains. Put a decent sum of money pretty much at once in a few different stocks in end of January. A few days later correction occurs, [largest drop in dow history](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/02/05/dow-falls-300-points-open-extending-declines-last-week/306400002/). I was not too worried about it, i was and still am in it for the long run. I was hoping to have a 4% gain by December 2018, that was my goal. I have now exceeded that goal, but feel disappointed that I'm still in losses in WMT, JD, BRK.B, etc. 

I don't get strong feelings like this often so just please allow me to express whatever I have on my mind. Feeling regret that I didn't put more in AAPL and AMZN, but feel glad that I at least invested in them. AMZN in particular though is the second reason why I invested, I feel like I should have just put like most or all of my money in AMZN and an S&amp;P ETF. I could have put a lot more into AMZN but I listened to people saying 'don't ever invest everything into 1 stock', I feel this was fair enough, trump made a tweet about AMZN and it went back down to thirteen hundred something, I felt reassured glad I didn't invest a higher percentage into AMZN, but now I just feel lots of regret. These bull markets won't occur again for another 10+ years. AMZN will never hit 1300 or 1400 again, I've missed the chance. I'm still interested in putting a lot more money into AMZN but I've lost a bit of confidence at the current price of $2000. It's getting very risky at this price point and I'm being greedy, I want high reward without much risk, goes without saying. 

Now I'm seeing these weed stocks, I don't know what I'm doing, am thinking about getting into them. Was checking it out a few months ago and people kept saying 'it's too late, if you haven't invested, you've missed your chance' so I left it. Then I checked it again this week and saw CGC go from $26 to $45 in just 2 or 3 weeks (increase of 70%). I'm getting feelings like holy shit that's insane imagine if I had put a good chunk of cash into that! I missed my chance again. I'm getting feelings akin to imagining winning the lottery. That' all, thanks for reading. Would appreciate any guidance to a newbie like me. ",Massaha,stocks
35,What is a good metric to tell how much a piece of good news has already been priced in? Specifically about Nintendo and Verastem,"I'm curious if I should sell NTDOY or VSTM before their next major catalyst?
Nintendo is releasing two new Pokemon games and the new super smash bros this fall. Has the market already priced in that news, or should I wait to sell after the results of sales? I imagine the sales are going to outpace predictions based on the excitement about these games on reddit.

37,Advice on where to park 401k and ESPP overflow funds,"27 y/o emergency fund already set, no outstanding debts etc.


This pay cycle I’ll be maxing my 401k and ESPP contributions allowed for the year, so I’ll have 9 paychecks coming with “leftover” funds. My goal is to treat this money the same as if it were going into my 401k (I.e. long long term hold), but with a different mix of holdings.


401k is 55% VOO, 15% each US small and mid ETFs, and the rest in large cap int’l ETFs.


The rest of my current (growth, non-retirement) holdings are split evenly between the tech giants (AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL), purposefully.


My thoughts on what to do with these incoming “extra” funds are split - should I initiate exposure to something like GDX / GLD? Or a defensive ETF (eyeing SPHD)? Or just into some more defensive stocks in general (thinking a mix of JNJ, KO, VZ, DUK)?

Their response to it *accept it or don't buy it* really doesn't look good to me, especially at their own fan base. 

I gotta say their partnership with organizations like FIFA looks good though, but even their FIFA games don't seem to be as popular as when I was younger. Every year people seem less and less interested/excited at their FIFA games.

58,How I got over a BIG Financial Loss...," A couple years ago I went through a few big financial difficulties. Took some big losses and then I got stuck in life. Thinking of the past and not moving forward... This can easily happen to any of us, so I thought I would share some tips/experiences on this subject to get over and regaining your life back!

1. Not becoming a victim.... Stop telling your sob story to yourself and people!
2. Living in the moment....Focus on the now and where you are heading. Most difficulties are caused from reviewing the past....
3. Meeting people... takes your mind off your past, your reoccurring thoughts and gives you new thoughts/information, changes your mood, and people offer you opportunities that can turn your life around.
4. De-stressing... Such as meditation
5. Learning valuable lessons.... These setbacks have huge gems in them, if you are willing to learn them.
6. Look forward to the future... Plan what you are doing. This will give you optimism because you will not see the past failures but the future possibility.
7. Work hard....this takes your mind off the past again and puts you into things that will improve things going forward...
8. Lastly.....Making it back :)",Matthew_Jay,stocks

Over the past 3 years, I've had pretty good returns on my portfolio, going from 13,000 to 35,250 in that time.

I only change my thought process when I want to, but at the same time don't.  I don't like to define how I invest.

93,"Just bought $500,000 worth of EA. Here's why.","I just bought $500,000 shares worth of EA, after this recent dip. Why? 

EA has consistently been profitable these past quarters, and only has room to grow. Nobody is going to stop playing video games, or mobile games for that matter. Like Facebook, the backlash EA is suffering from the recent drama is temporary. People are addicted to video games, and EA will keep making money.

As a result, this has been a perfect buying opportunity. Personally, I think EA is going to $100b market cap, or worth $300 a share.

95,Option Buying Power,"Can someone please explain how options buying power is impacted by buying a futures contract?

I’m familiar with trading stocks where if you want to buy a stock for $100 you need at least $100 in your account. I’m looking at /ES which let’s assume has a current price of $2900 but in TOS it seems I can’t even buy 1 contract at $2900 when I have $3000 in the account. (Fictional balance). So then I find out there is a minimum balance required to trade /Es on TOS which I think was ~6800? So how much do I really need in an account to buy 1 contract of this future?

In papertrading when I buy 1 contract at 2900 the options buying power doesn’t move by 2900. It doesn’t move by 5600 (if I assumed there was 2x exposure). I haven’t figured out how it’s calculated. What is driving this? I’m obviously talking about trading in a margin account but why does this behave differently than being a credit to cash (aka BP) for the amount of the contract?

There was someone on here touting their profits at trading /es but they claimed it only cost them $50 at a time. Again, that is not what I’m seeing based on papertrading in TOS.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can straighten me out here or direct me to a good source for explanation. I’ve googled but haven’t found much of a direct answer.",CWard2005,stocks

So while PDD hasn't been on the stock market for a whole year, it seems that with this earnings report, the stock price should have gone up significantly. Is there something that I'm missing here with the stock? Was this growth already priced in when the company went public? Or are these figures questionable?

110,How predictable are stock prices?,"I'm a complete novice, and this is a theory I have on stocks, it would be nice if you could point out any wrong assumptions or conclusions I made. 

I'm thinking that either one of these statements would have to be true: 

1) Stock prices are (almost completely) unpredictable.     
2) Stock prices are (to a relatively big extent) predictable.      



If 1) is true, the question arises why there are _so many_ magazines and online articles that give advice on trading? They would be mostly guessing and only be right about 50% of the time, so you wouldn't need to listen to their advice at all. 

If 2) is true, then I see the following possibilities:  
either:     
A) stock prices are easy to predict; there are a few factors (whatever they are, but they should not be hard to find out) that determine the growth of a stock. If you always act according to these factors, you would with very high probability win money in the long run.     
B) there are experts (for example people who write articles on these subjects) who can predict prices. So if you always do what these experts are doing, you too will win money in the long run. 

The only issue I see with this theory at the moment is that you can't (or if you can, it probably is very hard) predict big financial crisises, even if you are sure that you predict the price of a certain stock.

114,Hang Seng and China,"I was looking over the chart of the Hang Seng and comparing it to the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. Obviously where these two indexes take turns is right after the late January / Early February correction that basically every major index had. The S&amp;P has recovered and made new ATH's in the process while the Hang Seng has struggled and actually gone even lower after the Jan/Feb correction.

​

Obviously a lot of this has to do with tariffs and currency manipulation on the part of the Chinese, but the fundamentals of their major companies and players have not changed. What this tells me at least is the beat down on the Hang Seng isn't necessarily warranted, at least not as bad as it has been.

​

Amazon has catapulted the S&amp;P along with Apple and MSFT to name a few others. Nothing about their businesses is necessarily different than it was before the Jan/Feb correction, so why is the Hang Seng different?

​

Has Tencent all of a sudden fallen off the face of the earth? Their revenue growth looked quite strong and their margin ratios falling were overhyped. Geely continues to improve and reported extremely strong earnings not long ago. I could go on, but the point I'm trying to make here is fundamentals of the companies in the Hang Seng have not changed dramatically enough to warrant a fall like this, especially considering the run the S&amp;P has had.

​

So ultimately my question to the forum is how long will it be before we see the Hang Seng catching up to the S&amp;P and setting new ATH's? Can people, like myself, who are exposed to China use the tariffs in the meantime to load up on shares at lower valuations to cash in on the inevitable bounce back?

143,Global turbulence helps or hurts US equities?,"Venezuela - Basically collapsing as we speak. 83,000% inflation in July.

Turkey - Country's currency called the Lira has been getting rocked this entire year. They are under immense pressure to increase rates to bolster investor support, but Erdogan fighting hard against it. Bad terms with America will only hurt it further.

Argentina - Just yesterday (8/30), it was announced they are hiking rates to 60% (!!!!!) to bolster investor support. Obviously this is just the introduction to what will inevitably be hard times in the coming months.

Italy, Greece, and several other countries are showing significant shakiness as well. It's clear that Trump at this point is making an effort to insulate the US from the world and these issues.

Does this mean global investors will all flock to the US Dollar and US equities, as emerging markets burn down around us? Or will the instabilities shown in emerging markets spread more and more to other European nations and then ultimately US as well?

My only concern is that the more advanced institutes that are interested in using robotic technology may have already opted for the $ISRG Da Vinci system.

I e. If ETF A has 6% AAPL, and fund B has 3%, it gives you a total breakdown of the number of shares or value you have invested in AApl overall. 

Thoughts in this sort of idea?

170,Best UK platform for buying US stocks (ISA),"My understanding is two main choice: greatful to hear thoughts/whether my logic is withstanding

Lowest cost/no ISA wrapper

- therefore subject to tax above the CGT threshold c. £11k. Which if you held for 2 to 3 years could be an issue if you dont sell and rebuy during that time. However a work around would be liquidating your portfolio and rebuying back within a year to 'use' the exemption. Although this may be hassle depending on number of positions you have and whether you manage to exceed 11k+ gains in a year
- low cost platforms
- trade in USD for US stocks therefore remove cost of the platform converting your £ at a poor rate (e.g. adding 1%+ to the actual FX rate)

S&amp;S wrapper/ UK S&amp;S platforms

- Any recommendations for cheapest option for this route?

Is there a free trading service for Roth IRA ( like there is for normal trading) Or anything vaguely similar?

a)  do I have to pay a 10% fee *and* taxes on profits or just the penalty? I'm assuming it's yes.

183,Need an experienced investor for a simple question about warrants.,"Hello all,

I invested in a company and the shares were traded between 0,07c - 0,10c during july and august.

During this period of time, 1M warrants have been exercised at 0,15c.

Why on earth? 
Is it because of possible price manipulation? Is it because this particular insider is very confident in the company? (The company is about to deliver its first contract and they had only 2000$ in the book).
Is it common to see warrants like 100% higher than market price being exercised?

Thank you very much!

Are there signs that they might make a recovery in the next six months? A year? Five years? Signs they might completely crash? I still have some money if I sell them that I can reinvest, so willing to take the loss if it means leaving a sinking ship.

200,[SHLD] Sears Holdings possible Amazon buy-out target?,"By all means, Sears Holdings is NOT a sexy stock. It's been on decline since 2007 and is on the verge of literally disappearing. It used to have a market cap in the billions and as of this morning sits at a paltry $132 MM. While there is still nominal value in particular segments of the Sears Holdings business (i.e. the 'Kenmore' Brand, 'Sears Hardware' stores), the majority of value lies in both it's vast physical retail footprint across North America as well as its largely-profitable logistics arm, Innovel.

As you may or may not know, Amazon partnered with Sears this past May in providing delivery and installation services for Amazon customers who purchased tires online. Initially this was a pilot program for only 47 Sears Auto centers across 8 cities. This month, however, it has been reported that Amazon has expanded this partnership nationwide due to an 'overwhelming response' from Amazon customers. 

My question is, why would a company like Amazon start working so closely with a retailer that is on the verge of disappearing? Sure, it could be argued that Amazon may be interested in the Auto segment of the business but anyone who has ever been to a Sears store should know that the auto and tire centers are part of the main stores footprint (in most cases, but not all). 

We know from history that Amazon's main goal is to provide near-instant access to its products. They have already been working on this using same-day delivery through third party carriers as well as amazon lockers. We also know that Amazon has been interested in testing the brick and mortar space for a while now. Could it be that Sears can provide a full 'turn-key' solution through it's large NA retail footprint and Innovel logistics company? Perhaps they are exploring a 'micro-warehousing' approach to better serve customers with 'last-mile' delivery challenges. 

All in all, at $1.22 per share, the downside seems very limited. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

212,Nasdaq 100 vs S&amp;P500. Which one?,"I hear a lot of people recommending S&amp;P500 to the lazy investor or the investor that wants to diversify.  My question is, why recommend S&amp;P500 over Nasdaq 100?  I've been looking over previous data and reading articles.  Here are some of the facts:

1) Nasdaq 100 out performed S&amp;P500 8-10 of the past years.  EDIT: For those who think 10 years is cherry picking.  Since 1986, Nasdaq performed better than S&amp;P500 79 times out of 130 quarters.  That is 60% of the time.  Looking at historical data, even if you invested in 2007-2008 right before the market crashed, Nasdaq wasn't much more volatile than S&amp;P500 where Nasdaq tanked 42% and S&amp;P tanked 38.5%.   
2) Your initial investments made in 2008 would have net you a 280% return by 2018 vs 97% if it were in S&amp;P500.  
3) Nasdaq recovered better from the crash 2008 than S&amp;P500

4) Investing at the all time highs during the dot.com bubble is the only time frame where you would be worse off investing in Nasdaq vs S&amp;P500.  Now ask yourself, is the top 100 companies significantly over valued compared to the top 500 companies?  If yes, then maybe S&amp;P500 is safer.

Finally, yes I know historical data doesn't prove anything...but we need some basis to go off when deciding where to put our money...so I ask, why did you put your investments into S&amp;P500 over Nasdaq 100?

239,Which stocks rose during the big selloff in late Jan/Feb?,I'm anticipating a similar selloff in the near future. ,neeknils,stocks
240,Please help me find the error/incorrect assumption in my math that led me to Sell prematurely,"Hello all,


I'm investing in a stock, and had a plan to sell at a certain price and then re-buy immediately with the profit from that sale paying for an additional share in the same stock.


But I messed up my math somewhere. I'm sure it's something glaringly obvious because I'm new to this. Please, r/stocks, help me find the error in my ways.


* The stock in question is MJ (actually an ETF). I have been buying small pieces throughout the year to average my cost of entry. Most expensive share was bought at $31.75, cheapest share was bought at $27.10. As of yesterday I was up to 17 shares at an avg. cost of $29.56. (I don't have a lot of funds to work with, don't judge)


So here's where I believe my bad math begins:


* If my shares reached a price of $31.50, then the total value of my shares would be $535.50 (17 x 31.50 = 535.5)


* My current position was worth $502.52 (17 x avg. cost of 29.56 = 502.52)


* So I figured that if I could sell my whole position at a price of $31.50, then I would make a profit of $32.98 (535.5 - 502.52 = 32.98)


* And then by immediately purchasing 18 shares at any price below $32.98, then I would be getting my entire position back (at a higher average price), but then also an additional share that was paid for with my profits (so basically, it seemed like a way to add a ""free"" share to my position with house money).


It didn't work out this way.


* I sold my position of 17 shares at a price of $32.03 for a total of $544.51.


* $544.51 / 18 shares = $30.25......this is where it was revealed to me that my plan was bunk. 


* I realize now that my sale would have needed to total, let's say, $571.50 to fund my purchase of 18 shares, at say, $31.75. 


I'm not sure why my math didn't foresee this mismatch in values. I clearly made a large inappropriate assumption, was completely blind to a variable in this equation, or just approached this problem from the completely wrong direction. 


Is anyone able to decipher my ramblings and reveal to me where I made my error so I don't repeat this mistake in the future? I thought I was really onto something but now my head is just clouded with unexpected confusion and I can't figure out the piece I missed.


Any insight would be immensely appreciated.

It looks like the downsize may be priced in already. Broadcom also has been consistently beating earnings. 

Alcoa has been hammered this year by the Trump admin tariffs and its ever so hard to choose based on short term trends like this. However, a better NAFTA deal and negotiations reaching Canada would be a big win for AA. I don’t see them getting the tariff exemption they applied for earlier this month and even if they do it’s a tough gamble on just that win.  I still like their entry price now though.

254,My friend and I are starting a monthly stock picking competition as a fun way to learn/research. This was my submission (CB (mine) v. PGR).,"\*\*\*\*\*If it is too long feel free to ignore it, just thought people could read it and feel better about themselves. I'd also love to know where I messed up before he lets me know\*\*\*\*

​

Preamble:

“When a bear enters your campsite you don't have to be faster than the bear, just faster than the slowest friend.” I don't know how true that is in the wilderness, but this is clearly true for fund managers.  If your portfolio returns 20% ROI but your competitor’s returns 40% you lose your clients. Fortunately in this race my competitor has picked the obese diabetic, so this race was an easy one.

​

Overview:

The insurance business is one that I wouldn't care to be invested in as a long term investment. In Chubb, Ltd.'s yearly report, they indicate their profitability was lower and underwriting was not up to their normal standards due to excessive natural disasters. Unfortunately if you believe those darn snowflakes, this type of extreme weather is going to become more and more prevalent in the coming years.  As such, I would expect the profitability of insurance companies to slide as global warming grows.  When coupled with the lack of brand loyalty most people have for insurance companies, this industry does not appear to be one of the high growth industries we would like.  However, if you are looking for a stable dividend, insurance companies would be pretty inviting.  The stringent regulations mixed with each insurance company’s maintained float allows an expected continuity long term.  As a whole, I can't say that I would be too excited with the idea of owning an insurance company, but that is because here at (company name) we believe in triple digit returns.

​

Statistic Snapshot of Chubb, Ltd. v. Progressive:

PE Ratio: 16.28 (CB) V 17.60

EPS: 8.30 (CB) V 2.70

Dividend Yield: 2.12% (CB) V 1.67%

Chubb is near the 52 week bottom, Progressive is near the 52 week high

Market Cap: 62B (CB) V 39B

Price to Book: 1.23 (CB) V 3.71

Book Value Per Share: 109.97 (CB) V 18.04

​

​

As you can see, it appears that Chubb, Ltd. at its current price ($135.12) is a much better value pick than Progressive. Are their PE ratios similar? Yes. Is that where the similarities end? Absolutely.

​

Earning per share wise, Chubb Ltd is clearly a much better investment.  As earning per share is one of the better indicators of the value of the stock, the comparison is striking.  Many analysts argue that Earning per share is one of the best indicators of a company’s profitability, which is what stockholders live for.   

The dividend yield allows for .6% more of a yield just for owning the stock. It won't exactly turn the tide, but it also isn’t anything to snuff at.

Chubb is also currently near its 52 week low while Progressive is near its 52 week high. Would a skeptic think this demonstrates Progressive is on the up trend while Chubb is on a downward trend? Possibly.  But to those people I say neh, it demonstrates Chubb has room to grow, while Progressive may well be in line for a correction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chubb is also almost double the size of Progressive - see market cap. Why is that important? The insurance industry is incredibly competitive and incredibly difficult to differentiate yourself. There isn't a lot of brand loyalty, and each person generally just goes with whomever offers the lowest rates.  Chubb's size, theoretically, allows them to cover more territory well and invest more into their systems.  In short, when it comes to companies size matters.

Book value per share may be my favorite statistic to look at for companies, with PE a close second. In my humble opinion, it theoretically should demonstrate the absolute bottom one would expect the stock to fall.  This is because the book value per share theoretically equals the value of the company just for the assets the company currently owns.  So if company A owns 100k in assets, no liabilities, and issues 100k in stock, their book value per share would be $1.  You know that, for all things equal, if you can buy the company for $.50 a share you can liquidate the company and make an easy profit.  For a real world example about the value of the metric, Warren Buffett has said if his company's book value per share ratio drops to something like 1.7 he would unequivocally issue buybacks because his company would be severally undervalued.  As you can see, Chubb’s Book Value Per Share is $109. To me, this indicates a company that is currently severally undervalued and it is nearing the absolute bottom of their stock price.  In comparison, Progressive isn't nearly as enticing when it comes to asset value.

​

The Few Things Progressive Has Going For It:

Progressive is currently on the uptrend stock price wise and continues to soar.  This is while Chubb is currently down 7% ytd in a market that pushes every company up, excluding Chubb AND GE apparently.  However, while a falling knife has no handle, in stocks you should never chase a climbing stock and judging by Progressive's 52 week high I feel the latter part of the statement applies here.

Progressive also appears to have a slightly more consistent earnings growth, but their earnings per share are still dramatically lower than Chubb. The number one thing I believe Progressive does better than Chubb is their advertising.  As mentioned earlier, insurance is an industry that makes it incredibly difficult to diversify yourself within. However, Progressive is one of the top insurance companies people can recognize, while Chubb is not a very well known insurance company.  It doesn't matter how much better you are if no one knows about you. I would like Chubb, Ltd to flex it's size a little more in advertising.  

​

In Conclusion:

Is Chubb, Ltd. a value buy or value trap? I like to think it's a value buy but that probably means it’s a value trap. Progressive seems like a safer buy in that it's on it's way up, but I prefer to buy a bottom feeder and hope it succeeds.  When that bottom feeder is one of the largest market cap companies in the industry nearing what appears to be a rock bottom I like it even more. I'd buy if I wasnt poor.

​

Sincerely,

AAL also has fallen more, so it has more upside, I think.  Advantage AAL.  (Seems like DAL is almost to 52 week high and whether it can go more remains to be seen)

However, DAL has less debt.  Advantage DAL.

DAL also has better dividends, so if the market goes sideways, DAL will be better.  Advantage DAL.

AAL seems to be more domestic, while DAL seems to have more international flights.  I think this is neither here nor there.

277,On The Look Out for Stocks With High Percentages of Family Ownership,"Hey everyone, I'm on the hunt for stocks that have a high percentage of family ownership, and thought I'd see what everyone on /r/Stocks has found in their research.  Some examples of what I'm looking for would be the Brown family owning large amounts of Brown-Forman, or the Shoen family and Amerco, or the Herlin family and KONE Oyj.  I'm less interested in companies where a founder owns a large stake in the company, like Google or Sam Adams, but may as well include those if you like - they may be the ""family owned"" businesses of the future.  For example, the Ortega family looks primed to become a dynasty after the wild success of Inditex.  Situations like RPM International, too, would be of interest, where the family doesn't own much of the company, but has been managed for generations (three in RPM's case) by the same family.   I'm especially interested in situations where high family ownership reduces the float, like Rollins Inc. or Wal-Mart.  FRP Holdings and the Baker family is another one.

Maybe it's survivorship bias, but every time I run across a company like the ones above, with a high percentage of family ownership across generations, the companies always seem to be high quality compounders.  Unfortunately, ""family ownership"" isn't an easily screenable characteristic.  So, I'd love to find more companies like these - either with fantastic track records as possible investments, or with terrible track records to serve as a case study.

So, with that in mind  - what family owned, publicly traded companies are you all interested in?",dying_to_be_vain,stocks

For me, I’m in Healthcare IT, so naturally I was drawn towards surgical robotics. I took a chance on TRXC early and did well after they received FDA clearance for their robot. I’m also looking into TMDI in the same area but there’s been several delays that scare me with that one and it’s at least a year away before they even submit for FDA approval. 


I have friends that keep raving about the marijuana market, but I honestly haven’t done any research there and not ready to go that route just yet.


Just curious as to what you guys may be looking at to see if it’s something I’d be interested in as well?

Earlier this month it hit the 30 cent range and I bought a nice amount considering my limited bankroll. And today it just absolutely exploded. I’m not sure what happened or why, but I sold early.

Other big brands are owned by Aon and other bigger insurance companies, so I am not sure the best avenue for investment.

""The U.S. pet industry is projected to account for approximately $70 billion in consumer spending in 2017.I Yet, despite consistent growth over the years in both the number of households with pets and the amount spent by each pet household, fewer than 1% of American pets are insured today, resulting in an insurance market of less than $1 billion.II Given that this discrepancy is likely due to consumers’ unclear understanding of the pet insurance value proposition, companies are adopting flexibility, innovation, and technology to help create awareness of the product’s value. Both insurance companies and investors are taking notice, positioning themselves to participate in what many believe will be significant long-term growth as pet insurance adoption rates increase in a severely underpenetrated market.""",liamheff1216,stocks

MACD's on weekly charts have crossed and things are looking Bullish for the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

This post compares some metrics to sort out some of the more undervalued plays. As the numbers show, I believe those are **Organigram** and **Aphria.** Both companies have relatively low market caps in the industry and produce the top amounts of product at the lowest costs. Additionally they have RSI levels on the weekly frame in the low 60's compared to WEED's at 75.   

&amp;#x200B;

Taking a look at Market Cap, Current Production Capacity, Inventory as we know it, and Cost to produce each gram.     

&amp;#x200B;

||Market Cap|Current Production|Cash Cost Per Gram To Produce|Known Current Inventory|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Canopy Growth Corp** (WEED.TO)|28.3. Billion|31,000 KGs/Year|$1.05|**19,721 KGs Dried. 14,895 ML of Oil. 1055KG of Gels**|
|**Aurora** (ACB.TO)|8.15 Billion|30,000 KGs/Year|$1.69|N/A|
|**Aphria** (APH.TO)|3.4 Billion \`|34,500 KGs/Year|$0.95|3221 KG Dried.   7,724 L of Oil. |
|**Organigram** ([OGI.VN](https://OGI.VN)) (OGRMF) on OTC|954 Million|**36,000 KGs/Year**|**$0.58** (Indoor)|4132 KG of Dried. 3162 L of Oil. |

*Note: Aurora's numbers are harder to get bc of acquisitions and trouble ciphering through their reporting.*

​

**Market Cap (Fully diluted Including Warrants/Debentures/etc)**

1. Canopy: 28.3 Billion  (483 Mil Outstanding X 58.62)
2. Aurora: 8.15 Billion  (949 Mil Outstanding X 8.59)
3. Aphria: 3.4  Billion  (244 Mil Outstanding X 14.01)
4. Organigram: 954 Million  (161 Mil Outstanding X 5.93)

​

**Industry Leading Production Numbers** ***Right Now.***

1. Organigram: 36,000KG /Year
2. Aphria: 34,500 KG/Year
3. Canopy Growth Corp: 31,000 KG /Year
4. Aurora (Including CMED/LEAF) 30,000 KG /Year

​

**Cash Cost to Produce per Gram: Prior to depreciation, sales and shipping fees**

1. Organigram $0.58 / Gram Indoor
2. Aphria $0.95 / Gram Greenhouse
3. Canopy $1.05 / Gram Greenhouse - At last report mentioned (Early 2018)
4. Aurora - $1.73 as of Q1 2018 (Need an updated number)

\*HEXO comes in at $0.89 / Gram Greenhouse, but that's also an old report.

​

**Known Inventory Going Into Rec (At the time of the last financial reporting)**

Canopy: 19,721 KG dried, 14,895ML of oil, 1055 KG of Tabs

Organigram: 4132 KG of Dried, 3162 L of Oil

Aphria: 3221KG of Dried, 7,724 L of Oil

​

Additionally, this quote was taken from Aphria's most recent Fiscal Year report from July 31 2018. This indicated that indoor product is at least a full $1 profit more than greenhouse bud. As you know, Organigram is 100% indoor, almost all other producers are majority greenhouse grows.

&gt;The Company has determined the fair value less costs to sell of harvested cannabis and harvested cannabis trim to be $3.75 and $3.00 per gram respectively, upon harvest for greenhouse produced cannabis and $4.25 and $3.50 per gram respectively, upon harvest for indoor produced cannabis.

365,Verizon investment and thoughts as of 8/26/2018,"I have been interested in investing in Verizon for sometimes but always forgotten because there are much better choices. However, it has reached an important level and it is forming a nice pattern here. While I am looking for a particular set of candles above 54.75 before I invest, it is still a good still to day trade before it happens.

Short / Long Term Investment  - I prefer a retest of 54.75 to ensure stability but sometimes stock don't wait.  Therefore, for now an entry at 55.10 or above with a target of 58 - 60 should do just fine.

Day Trade - Focus on the 54.75 or above for any momentum and ride it until you get stop out.

368,Investing in AI: What improvements do they lack to AI to became really as the human brain?,"I   study a little  bit of statistic  and  as I have  seen  machine  learning and   deep learning are  basically  statistical modelling  with   the more  likley outcome to happen  (computed)  which  is  taken  as   ''true''  , or  at the least  the  ''most likely''  to happen  between  the  other  decision  trees.

So   for  example  a tree  has an outcome probability of 56% if compared  to  others and then  this  is taken over the  other ones.

​

As   you can see   it's a  statistical modelling  way, driven by human   algortims.  What  I am  asking, is  if there  is some cloused source   code / project  that  is  working on making AI  similar to  brain  learning and  it to  took decision by itself, without relying on  pre-imposted  algoritms.

​Is  there any project working on this?

&amp;#x200B;

I would like a  cloused  source project  with  pending  patents  to invest in, because  actually deep learning is  at the primitive stage  but  I  think  some one  will come with a  self learning  alogritm which  can take  decision and ''really'' learn... and  the conmpany  which  will have patent  on this  will be   valuable  so much.

371,BUY XRAY FOR +25% MOVE IN WEEKS,"Interesting setup:
 
Dentsply Sirona (XRAY) stock closed at $38.50 on Friday, 8/25.   -42% YTD.
 
For the past two years we’ve seen the stock perform very well in the weeks leading up to the company’s major conference DENTSPLY SIRONA WORLD.   This year being held in Orlando, FL on Sep 13-15.  Over 95 speakers and thousands of attendees- this year Katy Perry is performing.  So no doubt it is a MAJOR industry/company event. 
 
In 2017, in the 3 weeks leading up to the event the stock traded up +25% into Fall of 2017. 
In 2016, it was held in August, and the stock saw a +10% move into the event.
 
This year, with the stock down over 40% into a summer low.  Expect this to potentially be a +25-50% opportunity into the event and through the end of 2018.   Most analysts have turned negative on the stock, which can often happen at low points.  
 
Any thoughts?

Well, I did have good picks, I put $3k into Delcath at $.03 and never sold when it got to $.3, instead i held onto it, and, well you know the story. I lost 99.9999%. I have been able to save up $3.5k through my part time job and I am stuck between 2 things- a car or stocks. I am in high school and I need a car to go to school and come home, that's it. My parents are able to take me home about every other day, so about 2/5 days a week I take uber to and from school. I was making $1k a month in my campaign job, but now that the elections are coming to an end on the 28th, I won't start work again until late September. The car I was looking at is $15k OTD and I was going to put down $1.5k, and the monthly payments would be $260, my parents will pay the insurance. Now that I don't have a job for another month I figured that I wouldn't be able to pay for the car, and I would be better off just having my parents cover the uber.

387,Question about getting filled when using limit orders,"Hello all. I sold 119 shares of a stock today, and insisted on using a limit order. I placed the limit right at the bid, and even changed it lower. No mater what I did it wouldn’t fill; the price was fluctuating and I changed my order with it always going at or below the bid. The bid/ask spread was 2 cents so it’s a fairly liquid stock. 
I attempted to sell all 119 shares in one order, and ended up placing a market order and sold for I believe 40-60 cents below market. 

Is there anyway to get an order like that filled using a limit order? I was on my phone so I couldn’t see the exact volume of the bid/ask. I was just thinking because it was so many shares no one had a buy order at the price I set for that many shares? Is it possible to set a limit where partial shares are sold (instead of all 119 at the same time, it could be divided up). I wouldn’t want to have to make 10 or more different sell orders or like 8-15 shares just to get filled as it’d be time consuming and complicated during tax time.

394,Real Estate Vs Stocks,"I have a decent experience in Real estate and just started getting into stocks about 5 months ago.

I find stocks incredibly interesting and wish I have invested earlier in my career. For some reason always leaned toward Real Estate and didn't bother much towards stocks. A friend of mine a while back always told that he prefers Real Estate as its something he can touch Vs stocks and it kinda stuck with me.

Anyway, The cool thing about stocks is you don't need a large capital to start investing. You can literally start with 500 Dollars and take it from there depending on your comfort level.

Let’s say for instance you are a teacher and if you invest 3K per year in stocks from the first year you started teaching, by the time you retire you will have a nice capital waiting for you. But I doubt a teacher early in her carrer can afford an investment home.

In Real Estate, Most Banks will require 20% down payment for investment loan. So for instance if you want to purchase a 150K property, you will need at least 30K to get started which is something most people cant afford. There are also closing costs to pay when you purchase investment home about 2 to 3%. During the life of the investment, you will need to pay taxes, hoa, insurance, repairs etc. On avg, the return is about 6 to 7%.

The Positive thing about Real Estate is the price appreciation. You could easily resell for instance the 150K example above for 220K today lets say if you have invested about 5 years ago. But then you need to keep in mind, you also need to pay selling costs which would average around 8%. The price appreciation for Real Estate can be huge but can also be average depending on several factors. Location, condition of home, how desirable is property etc

Investing in primary residence is also a superb idea. You can get help from FHA with a low down payment. But then again its all about timing. If you have bought right after the crash, you will be sitting on nice equity now easily 70K +. Timing, location and condition of property are key.

The thing that I really love about stocks is you could invest small amounts over an extended period of time and if you are patient, it would accumulate to a really nice capital. Apple for instance went up 231% in 5 years which is something you will not probably get in Real Estate.

Both investments are incredible but stocks imho have an advantage which is the fact you could start investing at an early age small amounts of capital. Over a long extended time, you will do pretty well...

They're a pretty well run company with assets that out-value its market cap. Been growing earnings steadily. They have significant **debt** though. That's my only concern.

However I believe if they continue as is and manage their debt appropriately, they're well on their way to becoming a trillion dollar company within the next decade, maybe even by 2025. Hard to predict though.

432,What to do if sale still hasn't settled after 6 business days?,"I have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) through Etrade which I never use for anything else, but this will be the third time I've used it so I'm familiar with how the process usually works (sell stock, wait 2-5 business days for it to settle, wait another 3 business days for the bank ach transfer). 

The normally long wait time between sale and getting cash in my checking already drives me nuts, but this time we are going on 6 days and my stock sale still hasn't settled, even though it states it should only take 2-5 business days max on Etrade.

I contacted them on day 5 (currently on 6 business days) and this was their response: Unfortunately we are waiting on the transfer agent for the proceeds from that order. I have reached out to my back office reach out to the transfer agent on your behalf to try and push the settlement through. Typically we will get information back, usually settlement, within 1-2 business days.

Do I have any options to get the cash out sooner? Should I file a complaint with anyone or request any special action? I don't exactly follow what their response means, but it sounds like it will be another 2 business days before I hear anything further and I don't have much faith in them to begin with.

I am a 22 years old student, have $3000 in my checking account (all of which I don't plan on investing). I saved this all through a job that I quit from recently so need to get another one.

I know all the basics from stock types, buy options, charting and so on. The course also went through different types of brokers. I got started with Rhood (can't name entire app), but I feel that I don't have the capital needed to make the proper investments.

I would love mutual funds like Vanguard but those have a $10,000 minimum or at the least $3000. So I am looking at cheaper options such as Wealthfront and Betterment to get started (leaning towards Wealthfront even though minimum of $500). I have also looked into options such as Acorns and M1 Finance, which some people live by and some people warn others of.

So I know the basics and don't have the capital. How can I start small or should I save? Would you guys recommend robo-advisors such as Wealthfront? Please let me know if I need to elaborate on anything!

**TL;DR**: 22 years old student with $3000 saved currently unemployed. Understand basics of stocks and leaning towards robo-advisors. Should I start small or save? And if I can start small then how?

472,My September Watch List,"Hey everyone, thought I'd share a couple mid-cap stocks I've been looking into over the past few weeks and wanted to see what you guys thought of them. Always enjoy the discussion we get on here and wanted to hopefully get some going here. I'll toss out a couple names and give a brief description of these companies and why I think they could potentially make decent picks. I'll also add that I'm typically a long-term holder with most of my stocks which I think is important to consider with some of these companies.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW): This is a cyber security mid cap company that specializes in computer and network security. They recently hired a former Google executive to help run the company which has been met with mixed feelings. On one hand, shareholders are excited to have a big name with lots of experience and connections on board. On the other hand, they are upset they are paying him an annual salary of over 100 million dollars per year. I personally think it was good move myself as he should help bring his knowledge and experience from Google over to the company and hopefully open up doors to help build relationships and deals with some of the bigger companies out there. The company itself has performed pretty well and is up roughly 46% YTD. The forward PE on this one is a bit on the higher side (almost 44) but this isn't exactly uncommon for tech related companies that are still growing and not yet fully mature. The last few earning reports have been pretty impressive and the company has recently set guidance as reasonably optimistic. They are banking a lot on their firewall protection services and have made a handful of acquisitions over the past couple years to keep expanding. Competition is pretty tough in this industry with competitors like Cisco and this is a sector where you have to constantly be innovating and producing results and new products/services or else you will get left behind. I'm not the most tech savvy person so I still have a lot of research to do on this one but I found it interesting and worth further research. The company and sector are somewhat volatile so I think I'll be waiting for a dip that hopefully aligns with my research over the next few weeks to find a possible decent entry point. 

MKS Instruments (MKSI): MKS Instruments is a mid-cap company that specializes in making components and software programs that are used in various pieces of machinery and equipment. It's kind of difficult to state exactly what they do as they are involved in quite a few different industries but one of their biggest pieces of business is in the semiconductor sector. The semiconductor sector has mostly performed pretty well over the past few years but investors are extremely cautious regarding it as the sector has proven to be quite cyclical in the past. Some believe (or at least hope) that with our reliance on tech dependent on the semiconductor sector having grown so much over the past decade that we are finally past the point of it being cyclical and that these companies can more or less continue growing and producing without fear of oversupply and production stoppage. The company's most recent earnings report looked really good for the most part but you wouldn’t know it if you just looked at the stock’s performance. Revenue was up, gross profit margins increasing, and they beat expectations on most aspects. However, guidance was set conservatively and cautiously which lead to the stock falling a bit as of late. They trade at a PE of roughly 12.5 with a forward PE of just under 10 indicating it is modestly and possibly even undervalued. This isn't uncommon for companies related to the semiconductor industry as investors are typically weary of putting too much into it if it will once again prove cyclical. While MKS is down almost 4% for the YTD, they are actually up over 15% over the past year. Yet, looking at their performance in 2018, they are down nearly 25% from their highs in late March/early April 2018. In other words, this one jumps around quite a bit. The big question here to me is the semiconductor sector. Is it finally here to stick or will history once again repeat itself? If it's the former, then I think MKS could be a great buy right now at its current price. If it's the latter then I think we could see further drops and it may be awhile before patient investors are rewarded. I'm personally somewhere in the middle and think that the sector will not experience the declines it has it the past but I don't think it's going to be like the last few years either. Not exactly great insight I know but I do think things are changing in the industry.

478,Options - Is this how they work?,"I'm new to the stock market and only have a small amount of money invested (few k).  Each month, I'm taking any disposable income and buying more shares.  Warrants. Am I correct in how they work?

You purchase a warrant at a certain price with an execution price and expiry date. You but the stock at the expiry date and if the share price is greater then the execution/expiry price, you've made money.

It's the dates I am confused on. I just want to confirm, in theory the closer to the expiry date, the closer the warrants should be trading at the share price.... Is that correct?

484,MEG-CA — why I think there’s a potential takeout offer coming soon.,"Put on your tinfoil hats. Basically Dan Farb who runs Highfields Capital, MEG’s largest shareholder, joined the Board a few months ago and then abruptly left.

When he left he cited something along the lines of disagreement with management over the company’s strategic direction. Word on the street is that there was a buyout offer on the table but management refused, which is why Dan left.

Then he filed a motion with the ASC to communicate in non-public fashion with the 15 largest shareholders of the company. Either he’s going activist on them or there is going to be a takeover. Market seems to believe this as the company has had a nice run in the past few days. 

Here’s a link to the motion.

**Notable Unprofitable Position**: *day\_drinking\_again* (-9.85% on PRECISION THERAPEUTICS INC.)

**Insights:**

* Options trading seems to be a favorite for many players. While a select few become successful on options trading (i.e. *Larson00*), the vast majority of options traders in the game sit on the lower half of the leaderboard, harboring minor to substantial losses.
* While options trading appears to be a lucrative investing vehicle for many, the vast risks associated with this type of trading have punished many investors so far.
* In the upper half of the leaderboard, portfolios look quite different. We see more consistent, steady growth in diversified portfolios consisting of blue-chip companies and/or index funds/ETFs.
* Last place *Chwderhed* was actually the sitting at the very top of the leaderboard just last week on some Nvidia options, yet now sits at the bottom of the leaderboard due to other unsuccessful options trades. This occurrence stands as a testament to the inherent risks and extreme volatility associated with this type of trading.

I wait till morning volatile trading hours are over (generally around 12:00PM EST) to buy.  Generally buying stocks if they look oversold (on a dip), or if i like the pattern (e.g. ascending triangle).


I scan on finviz for stocks with a price over $5, relative volume over 2, and stocks trading with a current volume over 1M.  (Same type of scanners on Thinkorswim).


I get nervous the stock is showing signs of breaking pattern; sell and break-even.  Or, I set a stop-loss and gradually lose a couple dollars at a time.


I use RH as my trading platform; however, I use Thinkorswim as my technical analysis platform.  Technical indicators including RSI, 20EMA/50EMA/100EMA.

593,MCHP +40% UPSIDE,"MCHP average analyst price targets are +40% higher than current levels.  

The stock is down 20% from a recent high of $102.50 as the company recently acquired MicroSemi (MSCC) and is experiencing short term digestion issues.   The ongoing US/China tariff and trade issues are also causing general weakness in the semi space.  

Before being acquired by MCHP,  MicroSemi was the largest US supplier of military aerospace semi equipment.  Microchip is active in the automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics space and a top 3 player in MCU's.  

Will QCOM acquire MCHP?

QCOM recently had to abandon it's $45 billion deal for NXPI due to lack of Chinese approval for the transaction.  MCHP, with its presence in the automotive industry, looks a lot like NXP.   QCOM has announced its intentions to buy back $30 billion worth of it's own shares, but investors may start to wonder what the overall strategy is.   QCOM, like MCHP is a big supplier of sensitive US military technology, and US regulators may look favorably on a merger of the two companies.  Further, given QCOM's issues with China, it's unlikely that the country could easily create obstacles for another QCOM deal without raising major concerns it's doing so for purely political reasons.  

What type of premium? 

30-50% premium would be inline with what QCOM was willing to pay for NXPI.  

For MCHP,  investors would at a minimum ask for +$110 per share, if not higher.

606,Could AMZN Buy XRAY?,"Amazon to Buy Dentsply Sirona (XRAY) for $52 per share in cash.

A global leader in dental equipment and supply manufacturing, XRAY has lost over 6b in value since July 2017.  

By acquiring Dentsply Sirona, a leader in dental equipment and supply manufacturing and applying its world beating logistics expertise, Amazon could deliver medical devices and products direct to dentists and physicians.  This could be a way to disrupt the medical product industry, undermining distributors such as Patterson Dental and Henry Schein.

Amazon recently bought Whole Foods for $13.4 billion, a 27% premium, a market disrupting transaction in the grocery industry.  This acquisition would be cheaper and immediately establish a dominating market position in dental supplies.  It would also be a ‘back door’ transaction as XRAY markets its products in over 120 countries, with factories in 21 of them.  It’s no secret Amazon is nudging it’s way into the healthcare industry and what better way to start. 

Amazon also has partnerships with some of the largest US distributors such as Cardinal Health.  Ironically, in January 2018, XRAY appointed Don Casey as CEO. Don had been the CEO of the medical segment of Cardinal. 

Similar to the Whole Foods deal, a full takeover of Dentsply Sirona would likely pass regulatory scrutiny and close fairly quickly. 

With the stock down over 40% year to date, investors and medical professionals will likely begin talking about this at this year’s upcoming Dentsply Sirona World conference on September 13-15 in Orlando, Florida.

I'm just trying to make sure my by with FB isn't biased as it was back then with BBRY.

**- BBRY h**ad a healthy balance sheet, although they had APPLE and then android as new competitors to the smartphone market. BBRY was a dominant position in smart phone market. Rest is history they tanked.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/)

I took long position on FB after the recent drop after earnings. Got in at 177, flipped it at 185. Re-established position at 180.

**- FB** has a healthy balance sheet. No new competitors to social media space. Dominant position in social media space. They tanked because guidance for future was negative, due to increased spending, not necessarily tied to revenue generation.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/)

Belief

* I believe FB is different from BBRY because I believe this drop is more of a investor over reaction versus a fundamental change to the social media advertising space.
* The reaction is due to the guidance that fb will be spending more money, not necessarily earning less.
* No new players to the market place, unless advertisers are moving towards twitter instead of facebook or instagram. Google still has a play in the advertising space, that is competitive with facebook. Are there new players?
* If consumers are spending less due to lack of disposable income, would advertisers spend more to try and get more customers? OR would advertisers spend less because they're aware they have a decrease in sales due to poor market conditions, so they'd save their advertising budget for a healthier economy?

617,Calculation of Intrinsic Value using DCF,"Hello guys,

First off, I would like to apologize if this is a rookie question but I really am quite confused and unsure in the calculation of intrinsic value.

Attached is my calculation of intrinsic value of a certain company. FCF represents the owner's earnings. Hence, in calculation of intrinsic value, I felt like the DCF of $105,072 was the future earning power of the company. Hence, applying a multiplier of 12.50, I would obtain the intrinsic value of the company. Would like to check with the community if there is any wrong regarding my calculation as I did not see anyone applying a multiplier to the DCF/NPV on the internet.

642,Why are dividends a good thing?,"Hoping this is the right place to post this, but if not, please let me know!

God help my soul, I seriously don't understand this and I'm really hoping someone can help me out. If a stock announces a dividend, the stock generally goes down in value by that amount. So a stock worth $100 announces a $10 dividend. The value of the stock drops to $90. As a stockholder, ya, I got $10 back, but my position is only worth $90 now. How is this such a great thing? I can reinvest that $10 or spend it or whatever, but if I thought my money was better off spent or reinvested in the first place, I wouldn't have bought the stock.

I just don't understand how getting dividends is a positive thing. Best case, it is net/neutral. Worst case, I then have to pay commission to reinvest the dividend that I got back from stock that I paid commission to buy in the first place (assuming it is a transactional account), PLUS I have to pay taxes on the dividend.

Obviously I'm missing something here since such a huge contingent of investors view dividends positively. Can someone explain this for me? Thank you!",dumb_questions_acct,stocks

Unfortunately I don't have a grand to drop on reading Berkshire Hathaway's research into graphene, but the fact that they've gone so deep on it leads me to believe I'm not the only one that sees a future in the stuff. After all, just earlier this year we got our first glimpse at potential mass manufacture of the stuff.

I don't think it's going to take off immediately, but I could see graphene steadily taking over multiple markets within the next 10 years.

So with that said, what sort of companies should I be looking into investing in to take advantage? Commodities will probably be strong to start, but it'll Peter off like any other commodity eventually. Worth jumping in early to ride it up the first couple years, but probably not as a long term investment.

655,Thoughts on price targets for CVS and PG?,"I finally returned to break-even.  Yay!  

Anyway, I'm wondering if it is worthwhile to continue holding CVS and PG.  Here's my analysis so far:

**Pros for CVS:**

* Acquisition of Aetna might be profitable.  
* Integration of Aetna, drug store, PBM, clinic, might be profitable.
* Jim Cramer recently gave the stock a favorable review.  I'm not a Cramer fan, but good that at least someone notable likes the stock, so it's not like I'm on a lone quixotic quest.

**Cons for CVS:**

* The convenience store portion is crap.  Every CVS I've been to is ghost-town.  I am shocked they are still in business.  I mean, a bag of candies that cost like $2 in Walmart is like $4 in CVS.  It's nuts.
* Health insurance competition is great.  Humana, UNH, Wellpoint, local small timers, HMOs, etc.

For PG:

**Pros for PG:**

* Well-established brands
* Diversified brands
* Staples (even if economy goes sour, people still need to brush their teeth)

**Cons for PG:** 

* Tariff exposure
* Millennial birth rate is not very good, from what I heard, and that affects their baby supplies business
* Lack of innovation re new products

My question is how to split those?


I currently sit at

3k invested in stocks,

2k as savings

and 300 as some sort of ""if needed/wanted grab here first"".


My current plan is to invest 200$ Monthly or rather save these up and use them to invest into stocks as I see fit.


400$ Monthly to my savings which I only touch if some serious shit goes down.

And 100$ in cash that I can grab whenever I want. Whether it's for a new phone, computer, clothes or simple miscalculation that could happen (whoops too often at a party and ate fancy).


I am looking for suggestions what to do with the money or if I should stick to that plan?


For my goals?

Unrealistic : I wanna become rich in 10-20 years.


pragmatic : I just try to get as much money as possible in the next 5 years to buy my own home. (costs around 250.000 where I live for a small one).

692,$CMCSA,"Making this to both share my outlook on Comcast Corporation and to get the view of others.

After thoroughly reviewing the financials, potential, and management of Comcast, I have come to the conclusion that there is an incredible amount of value within.

First off, in looking at user statistics, Comcast reaches under half of American households in television entertainment. Not only are they infamously attempting to make ambitious acquisitions, but there is plenty of room to run on subscriptions alone. This isn't even accounting for the immense variety of stations they own, where each program has its own audience (can also grow on that scale). 

Comcast is also making great strides in internet and broadband technologies. Their ever-increasing revenues from this division has allowed them significant ground in a industry consisting of other large-cap companies including the likes of Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc. This also affirms the sentiment that there is plenty of room to grow. 

One of the most appealing aspects to this company is their market value. $160B for a company that brings in over $80B in revenue and significant earnings (and more importantly net income) allows for a P/E ratio below 7. Additionally, management has displayed higher-than-industry averages for return on equity, invested capital, and assets.

I was wondering if anybody else was thinking the same thing or not? Is this just too good to be true?",AlgebraIsLit,stocks

694,NVDA will miss on ER. DD inside,"If you haven't already, go read my other NVDA DD post [linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8yh106/nvda_and_possibly_amd_is_screwed_for_q2_earnings/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link).

TL;DR of all that is they overproduced cards heavily due to crypto or something else, but it didn't hit until this quarter.  Now their OEMs are reporting revenue losses and a there's a report that one of them returned [300,000 cards](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-oem-partner-300k-gpu-inventory-issues-next-gen-geforce-delay/).

A few tweaks since then:  

The guidance they gave reports their cryptocurrency related sales will be down to 1/3 of the first quarter results.  This is around a drop of 7% Q/Q, but will not cause a drop since it has been known since last ER.

Gigabyte, an OEM of NVDA cards reported a 31% revenue loss in june and [21% in july](http://emops.twse.com.tw/server-java/t05st10_e?TYPEK=sii&amp;step=show&amp;co_id=2376&amp;year=2018&amp;month=07).  That's a shit ton of lost revenue for NVDA as they are on the end of this.  

[Graphics cards prices have tanked since February](https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/video-card/).  In some cases there is a 50% drop in price, which means a saturated market.  This trend has only continued through this quarter.

The stock price has been fairly flat since their last ER, so if they miss it won't be by much.  A friend from discord made a comparison of [NVDA earnings moves](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/473258113819082775/477663009997848598/Screen_Shot_2018-08-10_at_10.21.51_PM.png?width=197&amp;height=469).  It is likely a miss causes less than 5% decrease the following day.

699,Bearish Due Diligence,"# Warning, Bearish DD ahead.

Hello r/stonks. I made this DD recently. Its basically a bunch of numbers, compared to previous market. I cannot stress this enough, please draw your own conclusions. This took me like 5 times to get this posted to this subreddit because apparently I can't use the word ""\*redacted\*"".

*Disclaimer: The term overvalued is kinda just a buzzword. It is compared to previous bull markets. Take it with a grain of salt.*

**For the past nine years, the equities market has seen one of the best percent gains since the Bull Market of 1948-1969. Corporate taxes are low, GDP growth is strong, and joblessness well below the Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU).**

However, quite a few ratios, economic data, and past performances are pointing to the conclusion that this bull market is close to its conclusion. For all data, I will be using the S&amp;P 500 Index. Sorry Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Nobody loves you (well I love Nasdaq fuck Dow).

**Buffet Indicator**

Not to be confused with the Buffet Rule, the Buffet Indicator compares the Total Market Capitalization (Market Cap) of the stock market divided by the Total GDP.

|Ratio = Total Market Cap / GDP|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|Ratio &lt; 50%|Significantly Undervalued|
|50% &lt; Ratio &lt; 75%|Modestly Undervalued|
|75% &lt; Ratio &lt; 90%|Fair Valued|
|90% &lt; Ratio &lt; 115%|Modestly Overvalued|
|Ratio &gt; 115%|Significantly Overvalued|

As of 8/1/18, the Total Market Cap is 142.8% more than the total GDP. This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a “Fairly Valued” TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.

*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I will indulge why in a future post.*

**Buffet Indicator Graphs**

29.3 Trillion in Total Market Cap vs. 20.4 Trillion in GDP.

**Shiller P/E Ratio**

The Shiller P/E Ratio is a better measure of valuation than normal P/E. It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.

Shiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\~ Years.

[https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1](https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1)

The grey bars mark U.S Recessions. Note 1929, 2001, and 2008.

MEAN: 16.9 (We are currently 53% above the mean, indicating an overvalued market.)

MIN: 4.78 (DEC 1920)

MAX: 44.19 (Dec 1999)

RANGE: 39.41

**Price To Sales (Revenue) Ratio**

The Price to Sales Ratio (PSR), like the P/E ratio, is a way of measuring value. Instead of comparing a company’s price to earnings, it compares a company’s stock price to its revenues.

|Price/Revenue Per Share|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|
|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|
|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|
|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|

The current for the S&amp;P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation. The chart below shows that until the late 90s, P/S never topped 1.3.

S&amp;P500 Price to Sales 1955-2006

[https://imgur.com/QbfwTTI](https://imgur.com/QbfwTTI)

S&amp;P 500 by Deciles 1986-Present

[https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j](https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j)

The graph above shows the S&amp;P grouped into deciles (each of ten equal groups into which a population can be divided according to the distribution of values of a particular variable (in this case Price to Sales Ratio)). Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&amp;P is the most overvalued it has ever been.

**Yield Curve**

Now we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.

The normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.

[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)

The flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the

longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)

The Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)

We are currently in a flat yield curve.

**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.

[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)

The failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&amp;P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.

**Dow Theory (the Public)**

Dow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn’t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The “Market Trends” part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.

1. Accumulation Phase

a. In the beginning of the bull market “In the know” investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.

2. Public Participation Phase

a. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.

3. Distribution Phase

a. The final stage of the bull market. The “in the know” investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur “investors” through apps like \*redacted due to r/stonks rules\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.

[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)

I believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.

Anyway. Draw your own conclusions. This is my first DD. Feedback and criticism is welcome. I will be doing more of these.

Don’t look now, but on August 22, 2018, this current bull market will top the 1990s bull market as the longest ever. However, be aware that the 1990s bull market saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain 417%, while the current bull market is up approximately 320%—so you can’t call this the greatest bull market…yet.

“Age is just a number,” explained LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The oldest man and woman in America are 112 and 113 years old, respectively; and the man smokes 12 cigars a day! Similarly, I think this bull market could surprise us and maybe last much longer than most think, particularly since we see few signs of smoke in the economy. In fact, the benefits of low inflation, strong corporate profits, and fiscal stimulus all suggest that this bull has plenty of tricks left up his sleeves.”

741,Questions on Altaba Inc. (AABA),"So I have a considerable amount of AABA shares that were bought by my father a little less than two years ago. I do not know much about the company and I can never seem to find a lot of information on what they're up to. It has been a *very* lucrative stock, but it is scary to hold when I don't know much about the company. My father is deceased so I can't really ask him why he bought this.

I know that Altaba is Yahoo and — from what I understand — that they are an investment company holding tons of Alibaba.

When I try to research them I can never find much information. Furthermore, I don't know if I should be using Alibaba's success as a direct comparison or indicator as to the health of the stock. I hope this makes sense. 

Anyway, what I could find said that Altaba is undervalued and currently the best (or smartest) way to be investing in Alibaba since you can get BABA shares at a discount through Altaba. 

I don't know if I should suck it up and pay big capital gains on this and start investing elsewhere, or if Altaba seems like a long term stock that I should keep. No one seems to write much about this company and when they do it's usually good. 

So, I guess I'm just looking for opinions on the stock or if anyone has any good resources they could point me to.

745,"Top dogs control 70% of the market. (Hulu, NTFLX, AMZN, DIS)","The top three in this category are Netflix, hulu, and amazon.

Hulu currently uses a 30/30/30/10 media split of their streaming service listed below:

754,Will netflix ever recover? Will it go back to 420?,"* Wall Street has set Netflix up for failure, forecasting their expected earnings’ growth that far surpasses what they could ever achieve.

* Once Netflix’s earnings growth starts to normalize to roughly 20-30%, we can expect their forward p/e to follow suite and stabilize around 25. That is above the market average and in line with other premium companies. At their current share price of $350, they must earn $6.3 billion in net income or 14.0 per diluted share to achieve a forward p/e of 25. To figure out how they could grow earnings to over $6 billion, I created a bullish simulation. If Netflix were to attain 75% of the domestic market and 50% of the international market by 2021, they would generate $6.9 billion in net income

Maritime link will then generate money etc. Seems like market is reacting to this long term prospect to have some quick gain with tech?

784,DRIP Experience,"I am 22 years old and want to accumulate wealth for the future, so was thinking of investing in some dividend aristocrats and using the DRIP from Etrade to let it grow steadily for the next 30 years. 

I already have a Roth account through the company I work at, as well as a Robinhood account, and Goldman Sachs Marcus savings account. 

Can anyone provide some examples of the success that they have had from automatically reinvesting their dividends? Or does anyone have some better advice for me. 

Thanks ",jgrossinger,stocks

793,Opinions on FLWS,"1800 flowers was an early adopter for e-commerce. Because it's a niche market and has been a long term player, I bought in in May at $12.05 per share. 

There has been a decent run-up and the financials seem stable for the last 2 quarters. Its steadily approaching a market cap of 1b and earnings gets posted in 2 weeks. 

I've considered increasing my position from 8% to 12-15% before next earnings, but I want to know if there are any other people long on FLWS thinking about reassessing the position. 

I original intended to make this a 1-2 year hold but I'm not sure anymore. Thoughts?",DeliciouslyUnaware,stocks
