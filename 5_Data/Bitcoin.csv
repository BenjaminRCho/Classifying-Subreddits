10,Casa Lightning Node and Lightning Ramp,"Hey Reddit!

Greetings from Michael and Tom of the Lightning Ramp team! We've been working on a new project and are happy to announce the Casa Lightning Node today!

The tools available to run a Lightning node today aren't sufficient to enable mass adoption. They require significant technical knowledge, aren't user friendly, or just plain don't work.

This is a problem. The Lightning network's utility increases as the number of people using the network grows. It will never achieve true utility without more approachable end-user products.

To help solve this, we've turned what started as an internal hobby project into a full product: the Casa Lightning Node. It's a plug-and-play device that runs a full Bitcoin and Lightning node at the same time. Our team focused intensely on UI/UX design while building the node software. We firmly believe this is the easiest way on the market to access the Lightning Network.There's limited availability, so jump on it if you're interested!

16,WeSellCrypto is back!,"Hi all - Some of you may have used our service previously to purchase Bitcoin &amp; other altcoins via PayPal.

Unfortunately PayPal has not changed its stance regarding sale of cryptocurrency, but we have partnered up a payment processor to accept 3D-Secure credit cards in many regions (currently excl. US, Canada, Japan, China-- full list can be found on our website - www.wesellcrypto.com).

We offer simple verification requirements (simply email with some basic info (name, country, etc.) for purchasing up to $15 per day.  Larger limits do require ID verification, approved within 24 hours.  Once approved, you can purchase any time going forward.

Some benefits to our service:

- We do not store your coins.  Immediately following purchase completion, coins are delivered to the address you specify

- We do not see your card information.  During checkout, you are sent to our fully PCI compliant payment processor to complete payment.

- While we do operate at a percentage markup, we are priced to undercut competition on Paxful, LBC, etc. &amp; offer 24/7 availability with instant delivery (no opening a buy, communicating with seller, etc.)

I would argue we have one of the best reputations for non-traditional purchasing.  Feel free to research around various subreddits (dogecoin, particularly) and find testaments to our consistent service for three years up until our downtime from last June.

Right now we're only seeing 1-2% of the transaction volume we previously had via PayPal but are hoping to see continued growth so we can return to at least our break-even point and continue offering our service.

If our use case meets some of your needs, I hope you will check us out.  Happy to answer any questions.",gregcron,Bitcoin

50,Immigrant stance on bitcoin,"Hello Bitcoin Community, 


I would like to share my story as an immigrant bitcoin believer!


As an Immigrant...


First of All i would like to thank the country i’m living in right now for giving me an opportunity to experience their way of living, virtues, morales, liberties and what not. As an immigrant I pay my taxes, I get no tax return, no health benefits or insurance but I pay my fair share for letting me live in this beautiful country.


On saving money...


As an immigrant to a country I try to save money for the future of my family, we all know... that it became a necessity to have money in our everyday lives. I wanna look back when I go back to my country that at least I see what I was able to do whilst living here,.
But to tell you honestly I can’t save money because they can always close my account whenever they feel possible or how come an immigrant is making this much disclosure: I make minimum wage! I try to save cash that my current employer pays me with, But with the inflation rate half of the money I’m saving for will be gone in 10 years.


Bitcoin....


With bitcoin I’m able to save money little by little I just put what I consider as a payment to myself for working. I don’t look at the price I look at it as an opportunity to grow my money overtime in 10 years
And see what it has become hopefully great! 


How bitcoin saved my friend’s dad... 


Recently My friend needed money because her dad is in bad condition and they can’t buy a medicine back home it was at night where I am and I have no car to go to western union that charges $4.99 for a $20 transaction.

Luckily there’s a money transfer that accepts bitcoin in my country i told her to create a wallet 
I sent her $21.63 worth of bitcoin it cost me around 0.8 cents. She was able to withdraw from the remittance center I got a proof! If anyone have doubts or a need of evidence can message me directly. 

Thank you for the time reading my story...

This is my path on how bitcoin is helping me rebuild my faith in the system if anyone got a question I’m here to help what I’ve known so far although I’m not a financial advisor this is not a financial advice just sharing my story as an immigrant believing in bitcoin. I’m taking the risk to know the other side of the coin instead of not doing anything in my situation I have now option to change that and I take it with arms wide open.

57,0.17.0 Release notes · bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki Wiki · GitHub,,asdghigkwer,Bitcoin
58,Privacy features coming to Bitcoin 0.17.0,"Looking through the [current version of the 0.17.0 release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.17.0-Release-notes)([Archive](https://archive.is/iVpAK)) got me pretty excited as there are some real gems in this release:

&gt; **Coin selection**
&gt; 
&gt; **Partial spend avoidance**
&gt; 
&gt; When an address is paid multiple times the coins from those separate payments can be spent separately which hurts privacy due to linking otherwise separate addresses. A new -avoidpartialspends flag has been added (default=false). If enabled, the wallet will always spend existing UTXO to the same address together even if it results in higher fees. If someone were to send coins to an address after it was used, those coins will still be included in future coin selections.


**BIP174** has been implemented, which will help wallet developers implement CoinJoin:
&gt; 
&gt; **BIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions support**
&gt; 
&gt; BIP 174 PSBT is an interchange format for Bitcoin transactions that are not fully signed yet, together with relevant metadata to help entities work towards signing it. It is intended to simplify workflows where multiple parties need to cooperate to produce a transaction. Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and **CoinJoin transactions.**
&gt; 
&gt; Overall workflow
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the following steps:
&gt; 
&gt; * A Creator proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs a PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.
&gt; * For each input, an Updater adds information about the UTXOs being spent by the transaction to the PSBT.
&gt; * A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys involved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.
&gt; * Signers inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they agree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs to assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a partial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).
&gt; * A Finalizer is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and possibly script information into a final scriptSig and/or scriptWitness.
&gt; * An Extractor produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format) from a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply add more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have to operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the Extractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel operation, Combiners can be employed which merge metadata from different PSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.
&gt; 
&gt; The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They're useful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and hardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Low-level RPC changes**
&gt;
&gt; sendmany now shuffles outputs to improve privacy, so any previously expected behavior with regards to output ordering can no longer be relied upon.

Also sure to be of note to anyone who actually uses bitcoind for a business, though not specifically privacy related, bitcoind now features:
&gt; **Dynamic loading and creation of wallets**

126,Another Bitcoin Bull Flag! More Crypto Rallies On The Horizon?,,phil917,Bitcoin
127,Is that true that the smaller the country - the less stupid its government's reaction on Bitcoin is?," After more than a year of closely monitoring world's government's answers to rising Bitcoin popularity I might state that, although there are a number of notable exceptions to this rule (mostly among Middle Eastern as well as some Central American and Asian countries), the bigger a country - the duller and, often, crueler its rulers' retort to Bitcoin is. Understandably so, isn't it? In the dog-eats-dog business of people's governance, the more you are threaten - the more aggressive you behave. Here's an example of the former USSR republic (now a small, independent nation) - Moldova. 

In a period of about a year [the National Bank of Moldova](https://www.bnm.md/en) (NBM) has managed to publish three communiques on Bitcoin. This fact is already very telling about the officially perceived level of Bitcoin's popularity in this small (4 million inhabitants, 132nd place in the world) East-European nation. However, NBM still keeps its bad central banking instincts in check and reacts to Bitcoin right with accordance to country's size, which, basically, means that NBM tries to not meddle with that new, unknown, dangerously unpredictable but, who knows, may be even beneficial for country's overall performance, form of money.

In its press release, dated back to July 10, 2017 NBM's said: [*""The use of (Bitcoin) is not regulated in the Republic of Moldova. They do not represent a form of electronic money within the meaning of the Law on payment services and electronic money no.114 of 18 May 2012 and the activity on their issuance and transaction is not subject to the competent authority’s supervision.""*](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/virtual-currency-and-its-associated-risks)

Those of you, who are (even vaguely) familiar with the unnatural language with which national bankers habitually express themselves, might notice that this statement is unusual in the way it unapologetically sates the unregulated status of Bitcoin in Moldova.

Even after it was recognized that [*""Moldova’s own separatist region, the unrecognized republic of Transnistria, has adopted (Bitcoin) friendly legislation that legalizes mining and provides incentives for foreign investors in the sector.""*](https://news.bitcoin.com/moldova-with-new-crypto-exchange-and-a-token/) NBM's position remains unperturbed, which was reconfirmed by bank's officials in their two most recent dispatches - that of February and May of 2018 expressively named [The National Bank of Moldova repeatedly warns about the risks associated with investing in (Bitcoin)](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/national-bank-moldova-repeatedly-warns-about-risks-associated-investing-so-called) ... "" and ""[The National Bank of Moldova warns about high risks of investing in ](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/national-bank-moldova-warns-about-high-risks-investing-cryptocurrencies).. (Bitcoin)"".

Essentially, those are fundamentally good news for Moldavian Bictoin-holders for it, most probably, means, that their local power-wielders have decided to adapt wait-and-see approach toward Bitcoin in order to buy more times for themselves and built a system which will be able in a future to shake a Bitcoin fruits tree rather than to cut if off.

Business Notes for Bitcoin Startups Founders:

* political climate: relatively friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: locally;
* industries to focus: e-commerce, e-jobs, marketplaces, FinTech;
* major limitations: excessive regulations, high taxes, low wages, governments control, absence of seed and VC financing, brain drainage, low-tech, agriculture orientated economy;
* stimulus: very high GDP growth rate (over 30%), low costs, little competition;
* opportunities: to bootstrap on local niche markets.
* Bitcoin (outlook): not regulated (positive) .

142,$1B Bitcoins On The Move: Owner Transfers ~$100M to Bitfinex And Binance In 10 Days,"This is the third post of a series of articles dedicated to investigate $1B worth of bitcoins (111,114 BTC/BCH/... BXX) that were dormant since 2014 and started moving actively. The BTC coins were originally located at this address ([15ihHoGs3onQBNnEH8afDFGvou9nD62Hm7](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/15ihHoGs3onQBNnEH8afDFGvou9nD62Hm7)).

The origin of the bitcoins is discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/).

A deep-dive into the wallet activity was discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bwsaf/investigating_the_1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_from_a/).

Today, I will focus on the transfer to major exchanges wallets that could indicate that the owner is selling his coins or exchanging it with alts or mixing it to cover his back.

I built a graph in order to deep dive into the transactions originated from the 111,114-BTC wallet and to follow it. This is the resulting graph were red indicates transactions &lt;1 day, yellow &lt;1 month, blue &lt;1 year, green else.

https://i.redd.it/nk3iov045vj11.png

​

I found that at least 15,593 BTC originated from the 111,114-BTC wallet have been moved to Bitfinex and Binance wallets. This represents 14% of the original funds and more than $110M.

11,114 BTC have been transferred to Bitfinex wallet [1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g) and the majority of these coins have been transferred in the last 7 days (August 24th - September 2nd).

Here is the list of the transactions:

**Bitmex wallet(s)**

​

I tracked Bitmex as well but ""only"" found 210 BTC transferred in with the following 6 major transactions:

Or, alternatively, catch a 10% fluctuation and it's pretty obvious when they come if you look at the patterns, even without knowing about indicators.

A 1% fluctuation is so common that it's practically foolproof. What are the odds of me getting into the position and bitcoin never dropping 1% below that price, ever? Practically nothing?

OpenCAP is a protocol that allows a reciever to associate an address (or payment code :) with a human readable alias, like mine: ""donate$ogdolo.com"". 

Combined these improvements allow users to send and receive transactions privately while also allowing wallets to offer a ""cash app"" experience. We can have human readable contact lists in out wallets!

For more info check out the GitHub:

​

**1. Personal risk**

If everyone knows how much money you have, criminals can decide that you are a worthy target to be attacked for your money.

If you are lucky, the attack will only be digital but, in many known cases, it gets physical as well.

This puts you and your loved ones at great risk.

​

**2. Targeted ads**

If your finances are easily followed and, let's say, sold to advertising agencies that show you ads based on your spendings, other people besides yourself might end up seeing these ads and learning what you are buying.

Even with legal harmless stuff, it might be a liking or a need that you'd prefer to keep private.

There's actually a real life example of a father learning his daughter was pregnant because of the ads that were directed to her.

​

**3. Business privacy**

For a business, having your finances transparent and available to anyone can cause serious damage.

Imagine if your competitors knew all about your revenues, margins, suppliers, the salaries of your employers, etc.

​

**4. Commercial leverage**

What if a company knew that you had a lot of money and wouldn't hurt you to pay three times the price they usually charge on a product?

They could easily show ""special prices"" for you on their e-commerce website based on how much they think you're going to pay.

​

**5. Miner censorship**

If your address is easily found and connected to you, miners can join forces to censor your transactions by actively not adding it to their proposed block.

Why would they do that? For numerous reasons, including government pressure, business interest or just wanting to see the world burn.

​

**6. Fungibility**

Good money has to be fungible, that is, all ""chunks"" of money have to be equally accepted no matter its origin.

That is the reality with cash. No one can refuse your cash or try to prosecute you just because the person who paid you got the money selling drugs.

If it weren't fungible, every bill would effectively be worth a different value (dirty notes would be worth less than clean ones) and the money wouldn't work.",truther10,Bitcoin

I recently found a lot of people struggling to use Bitpay's Payment Protocol implementation. It was a while since they announced it and there were some solutions (decoders). But the problem with them is that they can just show you the wrong address/amount and there is no way for you to verify it.

I'm going to show you how to get the address/amount yourself. 

Its quite simple. When you get payment gateway, you need to get the link from there. 
Then you need to send a GET request to that link with header: ""Accept"" and value ""application/payment-request"" 
You will get JSON response with the address and amount required to pay. Now, not everyone is in tech business and knows how to do that. 
You will need a free tool called Postman. Download it and from there it should be straightforward.  

Example: https://i.imgur.com/Qoy71hJ.png

However, Mr McAfee maintains that the claim stands.

Bitfi had offered a $250,000 (£190,000) reward to anyone who hacked the wallet.

But it stated that the Bitcoin inside must be removed from the wallet - which was controversial among the cybersecurity community as often weaknesses are identified but not acted upon.

The group claimed to have hacked the wallet once before but Bitfi and Mr McAfee refused to accept their evidence.

They said it didn't qualify for the reward - known as a bug bounty - because none of the digital currency was actually removed.""

The Electrum wallet is part of a bootable Tails installation. The code for both Tails and Electrum are both open source. I never use the bootable Tails for anything other than using the Electrum wallet, and when I’m done the machine is powered off. 

Recently there was a post about a guy having something like 55 Bitcoin stolen off his machine through what he thought was some sort of Remote Desktop virus, as the wallet software was open on his PC when he woke up, and it wasn’t open when he went to bed. 

Everyone in the thread kept saying hardware wallet, hardware wallet. 

I use iPhone, Trezor doesn’t work with iPhone, but honestly I’ve never been too keen with not being able to access the firmware on the hardware wallet and just having to hope that the one I ordered hasn’t been comprised in the supply chain. So, I decided on Electrum as it is a well-established project, it is open-source, which allows me to feel reasonably certain that the code has been reviewed and checked for bullshit. Unlike Breadwallet, which I love, but ultimately must run on my closed-platform iOS, and because of that can never be really trusted.

226,I have faith in Bitcoin.,"Bitcoin works.  Bitcoin is strong and growing.

What are some of the alternatives to Bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep using fiat?**  No, thanks.  Fiat money always ends up being worthless.  History teaches us this same lesson, many times.  Fiat is but one step along the road to ruin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Go back to the gold standard?**  This could work, but it's not likely to happen, as central banks have hoarded most of the gold.  Funny how when central bank hold many **thousands of tons of gold**, but they expect the rest of us to remain ignorant and cling to their fiat ""play money"" which they create from thin air in order to rob us.  The gold standard could still work, but it isn't likely to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alt coins?**  Nope.  S. Ammous has a section in chapter 10 of his book, ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" where he explains why alt-coins are not the answer.  In part:

&gt;While it is common to think that these currencies exist in competition with Bitcoin, and that one of them might overtake Bitcoin in the future, in reality they are not in competition with Bitcoin because they can never have the properties that make Bitcoin functional as digital cash and sound money. In order for a digital system to function as digital cash, it has to be outside the control of any third party; its operation needs to conform to the will of its user according to the protocol, with no possibility for any third party to stop these payments. After years of watching altcoins get created, it seems impossible that any coin will recreate the adversarial standoff that exists between Bitcoin stakeholders and prevents any party from controlling payments in it.  
&gt;  
&gt;. . .  
&gt;  
&gt;...virtually all altcoins have a team in charge; they began the project, marketed it, designed the marketing material, and plugged press releases into the press as if they were news items, while also having the advantage of mining a large number of coins early before anybody had heard of the coins. These teams are publicly known individuals, and no matter how hard they might try, they cannot demonstrate credibly that they have no control over the direction of the currency, which undermines any claims other currencies might have to being a form of digital cash that cannot be edited or controlled by any third party.

252,LEOOY: Accelerating the development of the tourism industry with blockchain as the medium,"With the enthusiasm of “Technology Era + Essays Era”, LEOOY is the first to introduce blockchain technology into the travel industry and develop blockchain tourism.

In the new information technology era, the text travel industry has stood at the fork of humanities and technology. Artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing have all entered the travel industry. The blockchain travel platform headed by LEOOY will begin to Blockchain technology is used in tourism. The development of the travel industry and the development of scientific and technological forces must complement each other. How can the modern travel industry break through the boundaries of form and industry and usher in new peaks?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ktpgtba5xzj11.png

The bottleneck of technology companies is low conversion rate, and the bottleneck of the tourism industry is low industrial efficiency. Technology brings time to the imagination of tourism, and tourism brings space to imagination. The OTA platform is the most widely used in the travel industry. It can even be said to be a monopoly. Tourism is ultimately an industry, not a sentiment, how to industrialize and standardize, and turn it into a liquidity. The scale of the commercial body, the power of new technology is still very important.

A typical problem encountered by the tourism industry is that consumers and markets rely on traditional OTA platforms for transportation and hotel bookings and transactions. But with the increase in usage, the drawbacks have made many consumers miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/331jpdm6xzj11.png

Consumer price issues, market service providers' cost issues, and various reports of deceiving consumers for marketing purposes are also emerging. The problem for consumers is that the quality of service providers is not in place, the prices of scenic spots and transportation are too expensive, and the implicit terms of the platform are too ""pit people."" The problem with enterprise service providers is that the platform is too expensive, resulting in large cost and inability to match the consumer quality at the same price, resulting in low corporate reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1q0runz7xzj11.jpg

The development of a service-oriented industry, consumers and enterprises are the mainstays, the new blockchain technology has the characteristics of “decentralization”, and the third-party intermediary platform is removed. Tourist service providers can directly connect with tourists, and visitors can pass the blockchain. The technology-based blockchain travel platform can query the scenic spot online, book hotels, etc. The information in all blocks can not be falsified, open and transparent to ensure the authenticity of the information. Real-time settlement through point-to-point smart contract, saving the cost of service providers, reducing consumer prices and ensuring the interests of consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/c68z7459xzj11.jpg

The tourism industry is a service-oriented industry. Enterprise service providers and consumers are the two main players. The occurrence of each bottleneck is due to the contradiction between these two main bodies, which leads to the development of smoothness. Therefore, in order to accelerate the development of the tourism industry, It is to develop new information technology forces to balance and resolve the contradiction between the two.

When tourism service providers pay more attention to the quality of service provided, and tourism consumers are not entangled in some problems of cost and experience, tourism consumers will pay attention to the meaning of culture and tourism, and will be more willing to participate, and blockchain tourism. The technical characteristics can be said to be a timely rain. Its emergence must be strong and powerful for the development of the accelerated text travel industry.

256,CryptoCal: World Blockchain Roadshow &amp; Berlin Blockchain Week,"For this week’s CryptoCal we have two new events that might be interesting for you. Have you heard about Berlin’s Blockchain Week and the World Blockchain Roadshow in Amsterdam? We’re also attending Bitcoin Wednesday, you can read about them in [**our previous articles**](https://www.cryptomizers.com/upcoming-blockchain-events-amsterdam/). If you have not heard of the other two before, we are here to inform you about these two upcoming events.

# CryptoCal #1: World Blockchain Roadshow - Amsterdam

[World Blockchain Roadshow](https://i.redd.it/j9nskjzqd1k11.png)

The group for investors and individuals interested in blockchain, created by [IDACB.COM](https://idacb.com/#about) (world largest blockchain association), has organized the World Blockchain Roadshow. Roadshow (#WBRSHOW) is here to bring chosen blockchain projects from all over the world to the biggest blockchain world capitals - starting from Asia, then going to Europe and the Arab World. Investors can join the event for free in order to meet founders in person. The founders will have strictly speeches only. Your time will be valued by organizers - so you will get new technological projects in ICO stage with special investors proposals. The event is being held on the 5th of September and will begin around 13:00. After the pitch session (around 17:00) you’ll have an hour to start networking because it’s scheduled to end at 18:00. Would you like to gain some more information about this conference? You can find [**more info here.** ](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/world-blockchain-roadshow-in-amsterdam-tickets-48878070625?aff=ebdssbdestsearch)

# CryptoCal #2: Berlin Blockchain Week – Berlin

[Berlin Blockchain Week](https://i.redd.it/oucwp5vt71k11.png)

Berlin Blockchain Week is a community-organized initiative (so they have no single owner). It is an agnostic movement based on the premise that self-organization is the backbone of the ecosystem. They invite projects, individuals and anyone interested in fruitful and educational discussions to join them. Berlin Blockchain Week is here to reduce the noise from the market and focus on education, in order to push mass adoption. BBW’s concept is simple: keep it educational, try to be as cost friendly for the community as you can and to create a welcoming environment. In total BBW wil host about 40 events divided over the whole week. There are a lot of differences between these events. They’ll organize an Ethereum hackaton, Dezentral Berlin Conference, discussions about security, smart contracts and many individual speakers for instance. You can find more info about this convention in [**this link**](https://blockchainweek.berlin/calendar/).

For those of us who are in the Netherlands this week, let's meet! After we visit the world blockchain roadshow, we'll be visiting Bitcoin Wednesday aswell! Are you with us? Let us know in the comments which of these events you do prefer and if you would like to visit another one in the near future. What is your upcoming CryptoCal? We hope to see you soon.

265,"Immigrant, Maximalist, VC, Mom and my 2¢","The only thing freedom directly translates to is not being a slave. By definition, slavery is being fundamentally effected by the choices, decision and whims of others. Fiat is the technology that has enabled that to the greatest extent throughout history, these are discussions I am seeing in VC circle on daily basis amongst people who finally see it. If you are effected by government decision which materially alter your wealth, you are subservient to them.

1 Bitcoin will always equal 1 Bitcoin, but 1Fiat won't ever equal only equal 1Fiat. Government can unilaterally impose policy which literally steals from the poor to give to the rich. There is a cognisant dissonance from within VC because they missed out, they are not retroactively trying to apply pattern recognition to fund the next Bitcoin. The problem is that there isn't, and instead they are funding ShitCoins and enabling a new generation of founders who conform to their bullshit expectations. At their core they lack the empathy required to be contrarian, which leads them to protect their own ego's and inadequacy by claiming they are. That's why they are all reading the Sovereign Individual together. Literally in Telegram groups discussing the salient points.

Money evolved as the mechanism to enable the continued existence of slavery. Happy for anyone to dispute that. What originated in the form of trade was the human body as payment for certain things, what replaced it was the value of those people in coin. Where we couldn't put a price on people individually due to uniqueness, we stripped away that and made slaves who were uniformly valued. This is where money grew from.

The reason banks dispute the innovation is because they recognize their juxtaposition against it's success. It's hard to support the model that will cannibalize your monopoly, just as Kodak. Furthermore, when they do support 'blockchain' iniatives more broadly all they do is enable individuals to understand their market outside the shackles of these prehistoric institututions. They learn enough to revolutionise the system externally, Amber Baldet the most recent example (who is awesome by the way).

Want to know how deep this goes? I received an email from one of the most prominent 'CryptoBillionaires' yesterday. I had a contact looking for a large volume of Bitcoin to purchase OTC. His suggestion was I use GDAX... my reply laid out the reasons why it was critical to purchase OTC, without highlighting why I couldn't, where he tried to mansplain the reason I should use an exchange CC'ing in founder of another prominent exchange. 

Anyway, just a few thoughts. Maybe Crypto isn't the answer, but in a world where the leaders of the free world dispute the worthiness of their own intelligence services I'd be inclined to hedge with an alternative. If you can own a Bitcoin buy one because it could be your token to freedom sooner than you think.

Stuff just got real. Real as in applied in a real world business in a real world usecase recklessly using real money.

People opened channels to our node and paid their bill and other people did not open channels to us but their payments were successfully routed and arrived in literally microseconds as well anyway.

I am herewith declaring the end of the scaling debate. This problem is solved. We can now refocus on the actual challenges like fungability and privacy in Bitcoin. 

I wanna throw out the biggest thanks to Rene and all the other guys who I cannot possibly name who have contributed. Also to Jef, Christian and Josh of fulmo who did an unbelievable job bringing the people together here and making this development possible.

This kind of innovation feels like the early days of Bitcoin all over again.

""I have the latest graph with different colours so my prediction is going to be accurate...""   All of that wild speculation is nothing more than pump and dumps or surfing on the bitcoin craze for youtube views and money.

If  you remove all wishful thinking what is left is an experiment that has not made significant progress in terms of its market adoption since its infancy.  After a decade in the works there still isn't a consensus on how to deal with more than 7 transactions per second. The  Lightning Network is still in its elusive phase where its  promise is greater than anything tangible.  Almost nothing is sold using bitcoin, a few services accept bitcoin but its negligible. Most of  the transactions you guys see on  blockchain explorers are just the result of  unhealthy speculation.

Bitcoin has promising  tech but its in a dire need of a reality check.

Then a few more months of stagnancy and minor bulls runs in May, he said BTC is sure to hit $25K by October 2018. Now, it’s September 3rd and he’s claiming $20K by the end of the year. Give it a month or two more of dryness and he’ll reduce his estimate down to $10K followed by $8K. Tom Lee is the king of being wrong. The only person more wrong than him is the mediocre redditor troll known as cryptogrip. These dependably wrong people are like the Jim Cramer of BTC.

  I came across this man: https://youtu.be/SBJ-Bzs2bXc doing amazing work running a dog/cat shelter in Greece and noticed he is only accepting donations via PayPal.  This weekend, I messaged him and recommended he consider accepting Bitcoin.  I gave him a very very high level overview and sent him a few links about why Bitcoin can be great for receiving donations.  He seems somewhat interested, but I anticipate that he may not be the most technically savy. (This is only an assumption)

What would be the easiest, recommended approach for me to point him to or walk him through getting set up to receive donations?  I'm aware Coinbase exists in Greece, so he can use that to exchange his donations to the Euro to purchase supplies, but which wallet should I recommend?  Are there any blog posts, videos, or tutorials that you recommend I send him in the case that he becomes skeptical?

Thanks!",deneca,Bitcoin

Through some digging online, however, it seems as though this issue has been going on for months. Coinbase gave me a case number and told me they’d reach out once the issue is resolved. 

In the event of a Coinbase hack, would the crypto in my account held on the exchange be at risk? It’s a semi-rhetorical question because everything I’ve researched says yes.

Selling price should not change if you click on sell coin. For ex sell price of any coin is $2.95 and when you actually want to sell that coin it reduces to $2.87 for ex and then commission paid on top of it. Isnt that a cheating to consumers?

415,Investigating the $1B Bitcoins on the move from a SilkRoad related wallet,"2 days ago, I reported that a SilkRoad related wallet containing about $1B worth of Bitcoins (111,114 $BTC and the same amount of $BCH and of other Bitcoin forks) was on the move after 4 years and 5 months of inactivity : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near\_1b\_are\_currently\_on\_the\_move\_from\_a\_silkroad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/)

​

Today, I will dig a little bit more into this wallet activity.

​

Below you will find a graph representation of the transactions sent over time from the original 111,114-BTC wallet to the most recent wallets which have received some of the coins. Each branch represent a sequence of transactions sent through several wallets.

​

Red nodes indicate the most recent transactions (&lt; 1 month), blue nodes indicate quite recent ones (&lt;1 year) and green nodes are the older ones ( &gt; 1 year).

​

* Picture 1: here is the location of original wallet within the graph ([15ihHoGs3onQBNnEH8afDFGvou9nD62Hm7](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/15ihHoGs3onQBNnEH8afDFGvou9nD62Hm7)).​

https://i.redd.it/jjhfpb4udhj11.png

​

* Picture 2: original coins are currently transferred on Binance wallet, in fact it is a major end-point/aggregate of transactions originated from the 111,114-BTC wallet ([1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s)).

https://i.redd.it/7novcf2wdhj11.png

​

* Picture 3: coins are being sold on Binance, here 100 BTC transferred to Binance wallet on August 29th ([174EZQcfnJS5ChVsTbZaJMmjFCYykMLu9t](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/174EZQcfnJS5ChVsTbZaJMmjFCYykMLu9t/transactions)).​

https://i.redd.it/9ungmsexdhj11.png

​

* Picture 4: funds are currently actively mixed, you can see a chain of red nodes with no other purpose than transferring n time the coins and splitting/mixing it a bit ([3Ah15skNb8R1teRWs6h2Q2vRywkLJWUhhb](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/3Ah15skNb8R1teRWs6h2Q2vRywkLJWUhhb)).​

https://i.redd.it/9lzr31n0ehj11.png

​

So it's now obvious that the wallet's owner :

1. is very actively splitting his original 111,114  BTC this past month (a lot of transactions are very recent, see the amount of red nodes on the graph);
2. some of this funds are currently being sold on Binance (picture 2 and 3);
3. is very actively in the process of mixing, hiding and making difficult to track his coins (picture 4).

Is the owner going to sell all his coins? How do you think this can impact the market?

​

***Update 1***

Following the request of u/btc-reddit, below you will find the graph that marks with red dots the wallets which have been active in the past 24h. At least 88 BTC have been transferred in the last 24h to Binance wallet: [18afibtW5NLMqMwCZD6yt1qhkmEbrfa3QF](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/18afibtW5NLMqMwCZD6yt1qhkmEbrfa3QF) , [1M2stLGnZGi9XhB2sqTwFfcSfxZhzYKHs6](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1M2stLGnZGi9XhB2sqTwFfcSfxZhzYKHs6) , [15jFKpCBfHN599TopLPQYdv2aNCRZSUw2r](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/15jFKpCBfHN599TopLPQYdv2aNCRZSUw2r) , [1F1EWmLJtYUA1yvDGRBQ6Z6Zjp33ci9EZX](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1F1EWmLJtYUA1yvDGRBQ6Z6Zjp33ci9EZX) , [1M2stLGnZGi9XhB2sqTwFfcSfxZhzYKHs6](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1M2stLGnZGi9XhB2sqTwFfcSfxZhzYKHs6) ...

https://i.redd.it/v4yql8ftvhj11.png

​

​Furthermore, **more than 2,980 BTC have  been transferred to Binance** wallet in August 2018, certainly to be sold  or exchanged with other currencies, which represents 3% of the  original wallet.

That's more than $20M worth of bitcoin at current price, it definitely can have impacted the overall price this month.

Most of it was sold after August 12th, which  corresponds to the start of an increase in Bitcoin price interestingly:

***Update 2***

​This address is also heavily involved in this graph: [1NyfNYAXZ76VNdvxUUVxdbhWFQGa7QDjTn](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1NyfNYAXZ76VNdvxUUVxdbhWFQGa7QDjTn). It saw 73,673 BTC go through it (only 350 BTC originated from the wallet we are studying here though), in a little bit more than a year.

https://i.redd.it/sbkx1etviij11.png

​

**Update 3**

This address [3D83uPnvodCLpwedooiRrLjdQ9pcFVZF32](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/3D83uPnvodCLpwedooiRrLjdQ9pcFVZF32) is part of the graph and is multiplexing a lot of coins, about 175 BTC in small chunks &lt; 1 BTC.​

​

**Update 4**

This is a more refined and complete version of the graph (the yellow nodes indicate transactions activity &lt; 1 month). I let you find where is Binance wallet located ;-)

Obvious, isn't it!

I’ve seen this correlation with other dates too, but I was trying to find a chart that better depicts this combined and overlaid instead of taping 12 sheets of paper together for each month, stacking them by year, and comparing the drops and peaks accordingly.

466,Shorting Bitcoin led to my investment loss of about 1.5 million Euro within months. Entire family inheritance reserved for a special project to benefit humanity is ruined.,"I signed up in March 2017 with IG Markets to open several CFD and stock trading accounts through a London based introducing broker. Not realizing that I have just made the biggest mistake of my life, I started trading with Forex and shares. Mr. Justin from the introducing broker guided me on how to trade with IG web-based platform. He requested to constantly monitor my trading accounts. Whenever I need help, he was always available to give assistance. I developed trust that he cared about my success. I was doing average with my trading and not taking risks.

Through active trading on a CFD account and gradual injection of inherited funds from my family bank brokerage accounts, my portfolio grew to about 400k within few months. I was confident that my trading strategy of holding on to positions to earn interests or dividends whenever market turn against me will be better than cutting out positions with losses. I wanted to invest short term or long term to take profits only or leave positions till losses turn to profits. I did not want to just speculate but I carefully traded with instruments that earned me interest or dividends. At this point, Mr Justin from the introducing broker took more interest in my trading and offered to visit me in Vienna. His reason was to help install L2 Dealer, a downloadable DMA platform for advanced traders. I found it very strange and felt uncomfortable that he will be flying from London to Vienna just for that. Not wanting to be impolite, I met him at Vienna airport and took him to the apartment where I worked day trading. He told me he is married with an Austrian and they have a grown-up boy. This removed my initial doubts and I developed trust and likeness after few hours together. After several unsuccessful attempts to download and install the L2 dealer on my computer, he called a technician at IG for assistance. The person instructed him to install a program on my computer that will enable him to control the L2 dealer installation from UK. After the installation was complete, Mr. Justin showed me how it works but I found it complicated unlike the web-based platform. I drove him to the airport and we kept good contact. Few days later, he sent me an email to trade with Bitcoin. I have heard of Bitcoin from friends and I was not interested since I knew very little about it. After few days of not reacting to his suggestion to trade with Bitcoin, he called me and convinced me that I should look at it with claim that the price action is fantastic. Out of politeness and trusting that he wanted my good, I checked IG Bitcoin product details, trading conditions and margin requirements which was at 12.5% in May 2017 for retail clients. I took a position which I closed same day with good profit. I was impressed and started reading everything I could find online about Bitcoin. It was few weeks before Bitcoin Cash fork.

Two major factors that led to my losses:

1. **BITCOIN FORK CONDITIONS:** Statement concerning fork conditions for holders of Bitcoin was not on IG website prior to the fork. I never came across it on any of several crypto websites (Cointelegraph, Coindesk etc.) I was reading for information. Without this vital information and believing the fork shall translate to reduction of value for Bitcoin, I held several short Bitcoin positions through the fork which led to being credited with negative Bitcoin Cash positions by IG Markets. Worldwide Bitcoin communities, fans, longtime followers and enthusiasts were aware that holders of      Bitcoin will be credited with free positive Bitcoin Cash after the fork. These much experienced insiders accumulated and built up positive Bitcoin positions to earn equivalent free Bitcoin Cash. Resulting short squeeze in combination with much hype and other forks drove Bitcoin price to about 20,000 USD. My trading strategy of never wanting to cut out positions at losses was playing out to be wrong. At the same time, I was convinced that the price was either being manipulated or being artificially driven up by large players that were somehow able to communicate with each other behind the scenes. I believed the price must reverse hard at a certain point. With this believe in mind, I kept pumping in more funds to secure my positions. It was at this point that a second factor I had not known or reckoned with was applied against me.
2. **TIERED MARGIN:** During the run up of Bitcoin, IG had been gradually increasing Bitcoin margin requirement till it eventually reached 100%. Margin requirement was also increased on Forex and stock positions I was holding. Up to that point, I was not aware of tiered margin and the accompanying rights IG had reserved for themselves through the signup terms. As margin increase was gradually being applied on my opened positions, I was covering with hundreds of thousands of Euro in constant stress to save my positions. I sold stocks on family brokerage accounts and pumped the money to IG. My trading account exploded to over one million Euro. Slowly realizing by December 2017 that something was not right, I finally found out about the tiered margins and the negative effects it was having on my CFD trading account. Mr. Justin and IG explained the rule (which I found very unfair) that IG reserve rights to increase margin on opened positions till 100% while charging and keeping up expensive CFD financing costs. I ended up financing the instruments 100% while being charged full financing costs for positions I opened at 12.5% margin. In my      own opinion and conclusion which I communicated, IG was employing these and several other methods to trade against me, to force me into giving up my positions at losses when Bitcoin reversal was imminent or obvious. Accepting my fate, I finally stopped pumping money to IG, closed the positions and ended up with about 1.5 million Euro in losses.

I am broken, devastated and sad. Who are the players behind last year Bitcoin run up? Is it possible that exchanges, brokerages and big players were combining to manipulate last year events that caused Bitcoin run up? Can government regulators be of assistance in case of foul play?

I need helpful advice and comments.

480,Better understanding the fiat 'fanatics'.,"I just recently realized WHY I have such a heated debates with non crypto owners: we are talking about religion in a masked way. Fiat and all forms of money can only exist because we all trust in the value and to be more precise, the constant value over time.

I realized that the trust factor makes it for most people just as emotional as other 'believes' and money has a much bigger impact for everyone using it in everyday life than a religion has for most of the believers of such a religion (extremists aside...)

Said more bluntly ""most of the fiat users can be called FANATICS when it comes to the currency the use, even though it is forced upon them and it is not the best alternative they could use (stockholm syndrome anyone?).

The problem with fiat is that it is forced upon us and abused just that much that most can stand the pain (inflation, paying for bank services, taxes, etc).
We have sane alternatives, gold silver, but in the current economic landscape it is very cumbersome compared to fiat. 

But now there is BTC it has the usability of fiat without most of the downsides and it is as sane as PM.
We are on the gaining trust / adoption phase and it will be a hell of a fight if government will decide to fight it. 
In this phase BTC must also find its value and thus become stable, I do not see any other way for a sane form of money than it has to go through such a natural adoption and price discovering phase.
But if BTC succeeds in becoming the global, reserve, currency we will look back at the 2018 top and just smile at the insignificantly of that top, just zoom out to all previous tops, they are hardly visible while at the time they happened they were just as breath taking as the last top.

But in telling most fiat users this you often find this religious 'wall'.
We are trying them to change their religion, and not just any religion but the one that is by default one of the most impacting aspect in their lives.

So the next time you spread our 'believe' please be aware how the other person might hear your argument, you are invading their beliefs.

Once you can step over your emotions and just rationally judge all factors most will be able to understand why BTC is a way better alternative, but remember most humans have a very hard time to do that as is painfully visible once you start discussing a belief with an average person.",Btcyoda,Bitcoin

489,Was the rally to 8.5k the last ‘fools rally’?,"I am on the sidelines here, I know the potential of decentralised currency is what the world needs right now, but am realistic enough to know how a market cycle works.

There are considerable vested interests at play here right now, miners and exchanges certainly don’t want the price to fall below established support (5.8k - 6k).

There are whales that want a lower price, but are struggling to attain it and retail investors won’t buy until they feel sure of a good thing.

In my opinion, institutional investors are either already playing with the whales or are hoping to jump in before they miss the next rally. Most institutions can’t jump in due to lack of regulation, but the ones that are serious have worked out, by now, how to do it.

If you look at alt coins price action, it would be reasonable to assume that capitulation has already happened and the bottom is in. This is evident in that the BTC price has not dropped to $5k or in to the $4k’s. This is not to say it can’t happen, but alt coins have certainly born the brunt of this bear market.

I would like to hear others opinion about if the consolidation in price is starting now and if you truely believe a rally into the end of the year is still possible. 

From what I experienced last year, my first year in crypto stated in July 2017, this dip could be the precursor to another rally - like the ones before. On the other hand the consolidation could drag on and either sideways or lower is on there cards.

491,Bitstamp terminating accounts and dragging feet on returning money,"For me, this started about two weeks ago, but /r/Bitstamp seems to have a bunch of posts that are more recent.

I'm working on buying a house, and my investment from 2013 is going to be the big chunk of my down payment. I was initially going to sell 6 weeks ago, but Coinbase wouldn't let me sell and their customer service still hasn't responded to my ticket, so a month ago I transferred my entire balance to Bitstamp.

So I sold over there and tried to withdraw maybe 3 weeks ago, got rejected by my bank. No problem, requested a withdraw to another account. Three days later, get an email to reverify my ID, fine. Another 4 days, and I get an email that my withdraw is being cancelled and my account is terminated effective immediately. It took a week for them to request my bank info again so they can start a new transfer, and customer service can't even tell me if they have started that transfer.

At this point, Bitstamp is holding on to $52,000 of my money which they don't seem intent on returning, and refuse to even inform me why my account was terminated in the first place. As I mentioned, it looks like they are doing this to multiple people, and /u/Bitstamp-Domen is giving vague replies to a couple.

The scheme is simple like this: He offers his help to go out of poverty using his special method ([example #1](https://i.imgur.com/szfysez.png), [example #2](https://i.imgur.com/wcfYuyN.jpg)). He describes it in very believable way (if you never used crypto before). He uses a lot of jargon words, emphasizing that his mining system not like others out there but special, Master one, very expensive and big which has its special perks of doubling bitcoins each 24 hours. And he desperately need your help for a purpose of pool presence to increase total bitcoin amounts as this affects final mining reward ([example screenshot of a trap](https://i.imgur.com/CpbgEtT.jpg)).

I try to read as much as I can in my free time, but it really isn't enough it seems since everyday I read news and articles that I don't understand. When I discovered RubyKube however I was intrigued just by how huge the idea seems.

**What is RubyKube?**

My understanding of RubyKube is that it is an open source platform providing people with the opportunity to build their own cryptocurrency exchange in an easy and affordable way.

Taken from their SubReddit:

RubyKube is a free open-source modular crypto exchange platform

We found in GitHub an old abandoned open-source project called Peatio, which was the core of crypto exchange platform, and decided to give it a second birth.

In just a few months, with our own hands and help from the community from monolith abandonware we have created an awesome application stack of several key components that ensure the modern level of stability, scalability and security of an exchange platform and named that baby RubyKube.

The whole thing is open-source, which means you get what you see. We got people helping us coding it from all around the world.

Whether you are interested to run a RubyKube-based exchange, or a coder looking to get your feet wet with modern Ruby apps - we welcome everyone!

This idea fascinates me. It's decentralization to the core. I'd really advise you check out their SubReddit if you find this stuff interesting. Maybe it's just me...

​

I recently setup an IRA with Broad Financial. My plan is to eventually rollover all of my funds in BitcoinIRA to Broad. The fees are a fraction of the cost but it is a little more work. I setup an LLC in Missouri based on suggestion from Broad.

I setup an account with Kraken. You have to provide a lot of documentation but I was able to complete and get approved in 1 day. They provided great service. At the time, they did not have an online form for setting up an account for a Business. I worked with someone on their chat and they emailed me the form with all of the steps.

I am now trying to setup a bank account under the LLC. This is proving more difficult. I am in the process of trying to use Anzlo. A free online business banking service but they do not allow you to purchase crypto from your account.

What banks are people using to setup their LLC account and buy crypto?

This semester I am writing a research piece on bitcoin and its effect in the art industry.  While I am a bit of a new guy with regards to this technology I can see its future possible effects on the industry and I am super excited about it (since I am an artist myself, and I would just like to get more information about it in general.)

549,Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin For Beginner," 

**Welcome all Peeps!**

Today I am presenting you an abstract but brief intro about Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin enthusiast, many of you like me want to learn about Bitcoin.

So let’s start the journey of Bitcoin.

Here I am presenting you overall abstract quality and accurate results on Bitcoin with simplicity.

First Bitcoin is the fastest growing digital currency in the market right now.

## Let's Know a bit History.

Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009 by pseudonymous programmer under name Satoshi Nakamoto and the real identity is still unknown. Basically it was defined as peer to peer electronic payment system based on complex mathematical algorithms.

Bitcoin is the digital currency which is based on an open-source protocol encryption network which is totally decentralized.Means people will only have authority over money rather than any particular Center or organization.

Recently Bitcoin become the center of attraction since 2017, as the very famous ransomware attack hits across the globe and many organizations became the victims of this attack.

As the organizations becoming the victims, their data getting compromised and the attackers demanding money as a result of data recovery in the form of digital currency name Bitcoin.

From here now the journey of Bitcoin and all digital currencies booming like a sun ray.

Nowadays,  
Bitcoins are used for paying as well as for trading purpose similar to other known fiat currencies.

Literally

Today's Figures: (its very flexible like share market)

1 Bitcoin = 443,015.88 INR  
1 Bitcoin = 6455.84 USD

How amazing and cool figures above it are?

That why there are digital currencies booming so fast pace and becoming day to day life par activity for investment and money making just like share market.

Bitcoin is the future digital currency which many countries are looking forward to implementing very slowly in practice as an optional to centralize fiat currencies like dollar, INR, yen, euros and many more.

As now today we see a lot of charges from different banks for payment transfers and transactions at almost 10%. But digital currencies need very fewer fees under 5% for any international payment transfers or transactions.

## Now coming towards Bitcoin Wallets.

Bitcoin is the digital currency you cannot have physical wallets like today’s you have. Bitcoins are used to store in software name Wallets. Like Pay Pal, Paytm and many more.

Yes, it’s kind of virtual wallets where you can have all money. Basically for such wallets you will have only crypt key through which you can unlock or lock your currencies for use just like your username and password.  
Make sure if you are already using such bitcoin wallets then you have to take care and keep your key secret.

## Next concept, I am going to put in front of you is Block chain.

Block chains in simple logic you may name it as logs register where each digital bitcoin transaction details stored over block chains. Block chain is also known as decentralized and distributed ledger technology where your cryptocurrencies transaction details are recorded.

Here below are the best links for more information on digital currency.

[Coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/)  
[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/)

## Wrapping up now

You now have an idea about Bitcoin. In the upcoming posts I will let you more about such digital currencies.

Plus I want to also enlighten one reason why digital currencies are more famous that's because the transaction remains anonymous. Mean the only sender, and the receiver will know about transaction details with secure crypt keys. Hence make sure you deal with right people for transactions as the whole process is irreversible.

Thanks for being here till the end.

Keep like share and most important support.

563,Anyone find it hard to connect with people who are brainwashed in the fiat world?,"I assume most people who invest in bitcoin invest a portion of their pay regularly eg 80% of their pay goes into buying bitcoin and the rest is just to keep alive ie food and shelter. 

For those who have been doing this for some time, they likely have a bit of wealth but at the same time they should not talk about this wealth because of risk of torture. Someone may torture the private keys out of you. 

So you cannot talk about bitcoin with friends, dates, etc. They will likely notice that you live frugally (because you're investing in bitcoin) and wonder why you're not putting your money into the regular debt slavery fiat system to eg buy a house. They will ask ""why don't you buy a house"" and you'll need to change the subject and they'll Likely assume you're just bad with money and waste it and you're too ashamed to admit you've been scammed and therefore you're dumb. 

As a low yield (or zero yield) asset and investment bitcoin disadvantages you in dating and friendship not because of any flaw in bitcoin but because most people are superficial conformists. 

It is highly likely that if you are investing in bitcoin you do so because you save up a large portion of your pay to buy the dips in bitcoin which means you appear frugal, but because bitcoin is high growth you'll likely be rich, but you cannot talk about it because of risk of torture, so your wealth is unknown and because most people are superficial you will be alone in life forever because they will judge you based on your leftover cash flow or tangible visible assets. If you are dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin you will have low leftover cash flow and zero visible assets.

The players can make a real pump and dump, set walls and manipulate the prices as desired.

The game is free to play. At the beginning you get a start deposit and your task is to trade to make a profit and take a place in the top ranking.

## What is an 'Exit Strategy'

An exit strategy is a contingency plan that is executed by an investor, trader, venture capitalist or business owner to [liquidate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp) a position in a financial asset or dispose of [tangible business assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp) once certain predetermined criteria for either has been met or exceeded. An exit strategy may be executed for the purpose of exiting a non-performing investment or closing a business that is not generating profits. In this case, the purpose of the exit strategy is to limit losses. An exit strategy may also be executed when an investment or business venture has met its profit objective. Other reasons for executing an exit strategy may include a significant change in market conditions due to a catastrophic event; legal reasons, such as estate planning, liability lawsuits or a divorce; or for the simple reason that a business owner/investor is retiring and wants to cash out.

615,"My personal experience of why a DECENTRALIZED currency is not only a trend, but also a HUMAN RIGHT.","I consider myself as a casual crypto trader. I read about the block chain technology, invested some of my fiat to crypto and at the same time, do some arbitrages. However, before what happened just a few hours ago, I'm not sure if I believe that being decentralized is that big of a deal. I had lived by doing pretty well relying strictly on the traditional financial system. Reputable commercial banks are everywhere. I live in Taiwan, which is a democratic country and I had felt completely secured about my financial assets before today.

​

I have traded on P2P OTC sites for bitcoins regularly. I just want to make like a few percentage off my Bitcoin by doing so. There is this person who I've traded regularly for the past month. He first traded with me on this OTC site but after a few trades, we decided to trade on our own to avoid fees. Everything looks normal until today that I went to my bank trying to transfer some funds. I was told that my funds were ""frozen"" and I had to ask the authority to know exactly what happens.

​

I was surprised but since I have only 3 to 4k USD left in that account, it sucks but not unbearable. Later on in the same afternoon, I logged into another bank account of mine. FROZEN AGAIN! My third bank account, FROZEN. I was in disbelief! I immediately went to the police station tried to figure out what happened. The police officer told me that someone had sued me for civil fraud. I told the police officer that I've done some bitcoin transactions over the counter with a lot of people but I did pay every time. The reply I got is that I have to wait until the court's approval so that I can have access to my accounts.

​

I was furious. There is no search warrant. There is no investigation. NO DUE PROCESS whatsoever. All my personal wealth has been frozen without any proof of me doing anything wrong. The police officer then told me that I may be involved in a  tripartite scam. I looked up online and this looks so ridiculous to be true. If you want to mess with someone, you can just send him like 100 bucks to his personal account and file for defraud, then there is a possibility that he will be deprived for his rights to all his accounts. I don't know if this is a world standard but this is what happens in Taiwan, which I consider one of the most liberal country in Asia.

​

To put everything into perspective, I have made a total of roughly 5 to 7k the most off selling bitcoin over the counter. The amount which is being frozen now is over 100K USD. This is just so unfair in the modern world that this can be done in today's society. I don't know that much about laws but in my opinion, it also clearly violates  the principle of proportionality.

​

After this incidence, I truly believe that it is essential to have control over your financial assets or currencies. People work hard for what they have and they should have 100% control over it. At the very least, everyone should allocate some of the assets to crypto so that they can have some thing to live off for in a situation like this. I'm glad that I have invested in some bitcoins so that I can at least selling some of it for cash for daily spending.

The original wallet owned 111,114.62 [~~$~~**BTC**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag) / [~~$~~**BCH**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BCH&amp;src=ctag) **,** which is currently valuated \~ $844M (without taking in account other #Bitcoin forks).

Last movements on these subwallets are 4 years and 5 months old (March 9th, 2014).

The chunks have been divided over time to 60,000 coins then to 30,000 / 20,000 / 10,000 / 5,000 / 500 and now 100 coins.

[~~#~~**Bitcoin**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash)**:** [https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1KyJr2L6CN5XhDfv9Sb5q3kjKwFCrRxTLy/transactions](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1KyJr2L6CN5XhDfv9Sb5q3kjKwFCrRxTLy/transactions)

Does the owner intend selling it on the market soon?

​

***Update 1***

For those who asked, the original wallet ([1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a)) seems to be related to a SilkRoad address per this post: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310600.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310600.0).

So it's most probably a wallet owned linked to DPR / SilkRoad. Note that this address is still active with 5 transactions executed in 2018 and 13 in 2017, with really small amount of BTC received/sent.

However, I ran some checks and it does not seem to be linked to the DPR seized coins wallet ([1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH), there's only a [0.001 BTC link](http://learnmeabitcoin.com/tools/path/?start=1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a&amp;end=1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH) between the 2 addresses), so either the FBI did not sold them yet (last auction was in [November 2015](https://cryptomining-blog.com/tag/silk-road-bitcoins/)) or someone else (linked or not to SilkRoad) has access to it .

Finally, if it's not a SilkRoad related wallet the other options are, by descending probability order:

a) a MtGox cold wallet that has been seized or is still owned by MtGox: in fact the wallet funds moved in March 2014 right after MtGox filed for bankruptcy one month earlier in February 2014;  these movements dates are really similar to the [200,000 lost coins ""found"" by Karpeles](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/21/mtgox-missing-70m-bitcoin) which moved March 7th, 2014 ([1dda0f8827518ce4d1d824bf7600f75ec7e199774a090a947c58a65ab63552e3](https://blockexplorer.com/tx/1dda0f8827518ce4d1d824bf7600f75ec7e199774a090a947c58a65ab63552e3)), just 2 days before the movements on the wallet we are talking about here.

b) a whale wallet since the major part of the 111,111 coins are coming from a very old deposit of 37,421 coins processed on June 21st, 2011 making this an early adopter's wallet  ([70d46f768b73e50440e41977eb13ab25826137a8d34486958c7d55c5931c6081](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/70d46f768b73e50440e41977eb13ab25826137a8d34486958c7d55c5931c6081))

...

z) CSW's wallet ... [https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit), credits r/mishax1

​

***Update 2***

Let's dig a little bit more in this wallet activity : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bwsaf/investigating\_the\_1b\_bitcoins\_on\_the\_move\_from\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bwsaf/investigating_the_1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_from_a/)

​

***Update 3***

This amount of $1B in bitcoins that MtGox is  going to return to customers looks pretty familiar, it could match the  111,114-coin wallets we are investigating here: [https://btcmanager.com/mt-gox-preparing-return-1b-stolen-bitcoin-affected-users/](https://btcmanager.com/mt-gox-preparing-return-1b-stolen-bitcoin-affected-users/).

But  the methodology of transfer does not match in my opinion, it looks that  the owner tries to hide the movements by mixing the coins.

Caverr has not broken down the barriers of storing coding within the body but he's on his way there. The DNA is synthetic and contained in a tube, you can go to a lab at any time and access your personal synthesised DNA data. The DNA language can be read by a sequencing machine to relay the users bitcoin wallets private keys. Cavarr hopes they will be able to allow users the chance to store their keys closer than ever, it then very own DNA. 

The idea is unique, though embedding coding within one's DNA may seem to go beyond natures bound. Could altering the human DNA have some serious side effects? This is questions yet to be answered, Caverr is still in the process of solidifying their claims and creating a revolutionary project for the crypto community to utilize.

It feels like with 0-conf, it could be an available replacement for instant payment systems. Not here for bcash argument, but really looking for a logical explanation. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the explanations. I thought you can't set a higher fee transaction that will cancel the other one before RBF. Cause i saw on a video (Samson vs bcash guy) that this possible manupulation scenario became a thing with the Replace-by-Fee.


But apperantly you could have done the same before RBF, without touching the initial transaction and get the second one mined first, right?",Xantrk,Bitcoin
717,Could somebody ELI5 why this double spend happened &amp; would (not) happen again?,"In an article from Coindesk from 2013 ([https://www.coindesk.com/today-is-d-day-for-bitcoin-miner-upgrades/](https://www.coindesk.com/today-is-d-day-for-bitcoin-miner-upgrades/)):

&amp;#x200B;

*""A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected hard fork of the chain. The pre-0.8 incompatible chain at that point had around 60% of the hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve.*

*""In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the chain without the larger block. During this time there was at least one large double spend. However, it was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not intended to be malicious.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I think I understand why it happened in the first place: the nodes running that ""pre-0.8 incompatible chain"" hade 60% of the hash power. And that second chain emerged because the previous chain couldn't handle the larger block size. Right?

But how did it happen that the hashingpower was unevenly distributed?

And how is it possible in the first place that one block gets more transactions than specified? I thought that each block holds always a pre-determined number of transactions?

How could a similar scenario occur today?

&amp;#x200B;

Would be great if somebody could ELI5 these things (and/or point to materials where I can learn to understand it myself) - thanks!

731,"Whoever has just added 6+Exahash power to BTC in the last month, thank you from the BCH community","I thank you for not diverting your hash rate to BCH and doing an overwhelming attack on the BCH network that would cost BCH investors unaware of this real risk a small fortune.  

It would clearly be trivial to rob anyone who was daft enough to put money into the BCH network these days now that sort of power has been wielded.

For instance someone controlling that sort of hashing power (6+Exahashes) could easily pull off a 51% attack on the insecure BCH network with a mere 4 Exahashes protecting it.  

A simple deposit of say 1000 BCH (Today's value of around $600k) to an exchange, wait for 2-3 blocks of deposit time, exchange to BTC, withdraw the BTC (Around 85BTC at writing), now fork the BCH chain to reissue the last 5-6 BCH blocks (perhaps taking 1-2 hours) merely omitting your original BCH transaction and ta-dah you have that 1000BCH back to double spend on another exchange and gained $600k of real value.  If people were still in la-la land believing BCH was secure and continued using it you could simply repeat-rinse until they got the message.

Yes that exchange would bar you from depositing BCH again but nothing stopping others opening accounts and doing the same since the BCH network is simply pwned at this stage.  (I have no idea how a decentralised exchange could even offer any protection out there for BCH holders at the moment other than merely dropping the coin).

The fact that you haven't done this and making meagre profits mining (6ExaHash/54Exahash = 11% of the block rewards = $11% of $12m per day = $1m per day) even though you could generate probably $1m+ in an hour of attacking BCH shows you believe in BTC and have ethics.  

I'm not confident other miners would be so selfless so perhaps this is more a PSA that if you own any BCH this is a very real risk to be aware of as the attack would happen quickly.

I rationalized not being greedy and keeping both splits with the bitcoin cash being an insurance in case a miscalculation had been made in scaling.

I’m seriously thinking to flip that cash for some more bitcoin. I’ve felt that figures involved in bitcoin cash scene pretty scummy for while now but the main reasons are recent reports on hash rates and holdings. 

I want these things:

1) is it true that the bitcoin cash hash rate is declining whilst bitcoins has been massively expanding?
2) is it true that bitmain holds a million bitcoin cash and only 22,000 bitcoin? If it is true then bitcoin cash price is definitely being propped up and it’s currency (never mind its network) is not well distributed.
3) bitcoin cash is now at close to its lowest valuation vs bitcoin since it received major exchange listings.
