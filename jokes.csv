He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

172,An old joke from my great-grandfather.,"*read this in a southern accent*

Our story today takes place back in World War 2, the sequel. 

So one day, old Uncle Sam pointed to our friend, a man we'll Bubba, and said ""I want you!""
So Bubba, a good man he was, said ""alright."" And went and joined the army. 
The day comes when Bubba's finally gonna get deployed, so he gets in the back of the line to get his gun...

And he waits. 
And he waits. 
And. He. Waits...

Finally, Bubba gets up to the table, and the man there sighs and says ""Well I'm sorry, Bubba, we just ran out of guns!"" The mans looks to his left, then his right, then he leans in real close to Bubba and says ""But here's whatcha do!"" He makes his hand into a 'gun'. ""See? Just do this with your hand, aim up, and say 'bang-ity, bang bang! Bang-ity bang bang!', okay?"" 
Bubba nods, and says ""alright."" And gets in line to get his bayonet. 

And he waits.
And he waits.
And... He waits!

Gets up to the table now, and the man there shakes his head as he lights a cigarette. He says ""Well I'm sorry, Bubba! We're fresh out of bayonets!"" He chuckles, and leans back in his chair. ""But here's whatcha do!"" He makes a 'gun' from one hand, and a 'knife' from the other, and puts them together. ""See? So when the enemy gets close, just point it at 'em and say ""stick-ity stick stick! Stick-ity stick stick!"" 
Bubba nods again and says ""alright."" And goes to meet up with his squadron. 

Out on the battlefield now, Bubba sees an enemy, a Nazi soldier, coming up on him. So, he gets out his 'gun', aims up, and says ""bang-ity bang bang!"" And the Nazi, well, he just falls down dead! 
Another one comes, and runs up real close to Bubba, so our friend attaches his 'bayonet' and goes 'stick-ity stick stick!"" As he pokes the the soldier... and he falls down dead right next to the other one.

This goes on for a good while, and Bubba racks up more kills than anyone... but, that's when things take a bit of a sour turn. 

A big, and mean *BIG* old blonde man, who we'll call Hässlich, starts running up to Bubba with a twisted smile on his ugly face.
Now, Bubba's about as *big* as you'd expect a country boy named Bubba to be; but old Hässlich made him look a house cat next to a lion.

Bubba aimed his 'gun' and said ""Bang-ity bang bang! Bang-ity bang bang!"" But Hässlich didn't even slow down. Bubba, now white as the ghost of an albino, tried again. ""Bang-ity bang bang! Bang-ity bang bang!"" Still didn't phase Hässlich in the slightest. 
Häs was getting closer now, so Bubba took out his 'bayonet' and went ""stick-ity stick stick! Stick-ity stick stick!"" Still nothing!

Bubba wouldve tried again, but Hässlich ran up and ran right *over* Bubba! Crushing, and sadly killing our friend in the process. 

And has he ran off into the distance, you could here old Hässlich saying ""TANK-ITY TANK TANK! TANK-ITY TANK TANK!""

192,"I was out hiking, when I got lost...","...I was in some South Dakotan ‘mountains’ ...or ‘rolling hills’ as the rest of the world would call them. It was just a fun journey to burn an afternoon and prep my legs for a trip with my friends to Yosemite National Park this summer. (I would actually go on to propose to my girlfriend at the top of Yosemite Falls!) 

Anyways, I was unprepared and was an idiot for only bringing a phone to navigate, but because it was a little colder it ended up dying much sooner than I anticipated; leaving me stranded. 

I couldn’t believe it. I felt stupid and my food and water ran out. I huddled up for the night and went to sleep. When I awoke, I continued my journey; I figured at some point I would cross a road again and high tail it to the nearest town. 

I can’t remember which direction I was heading but it was South-ish. Hours went by when eventually I saw a group of people in the distance. As I approached, it looked like an odd group of people, pretty worn, tattered and very malnourished. They were all standing in a line with empty jugs that looked like they were for juice. I started walking by them to see where they were heading, but one of them at the back grabbed me by the collar and said, “HEY, NO CUTTIN!” 

I was taken aback so for the moment I hopped in line behind him. A few more trickled in behind me. I turned to a younger lady and asked what everyone was waiting for today. She held up her pitcher weakly and whispered, “Punch.” 

Confused, I turned around and figured I could use *something* to eat or drink so I decided to stay and wait my turn. 

As the line moved forward I saw there was a door ahead of me on a large looking shed that I figured must be some sort of kitchen. The line shuffled on until it was my turn. 

The guy ahead of me exited and I noticed he didn’t have his pitcher anymore. Confused I pushed in. 

I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. 

I couldn’t believe the *stench.*

I was in a huge room with a dirt floor, with only a big wooden stake in the middle of the room surrounded by piles and piles of crap. 

And that’s not even the weird part. 

There was a HUGE bare-breasted woman across the room sitting on a throne with a guy squeezing out her tits. I was appalled. I was disgusted, and I felt like I might throw up. 

The man turns to me and yells, “Gimme a titty pitcher!” 

Startled I stammer, “T-t-t-titty pitcher? I thought the pitcher was for punch!” 

The man turned slowly, and walked across the room, stepping over piles of shit. When he got close, he looked me up and down, put his hand on the wooden post; spat out his tobacco and said...

This is flight 367 to Shannon Airport, Landing at Shannon isn't guaranteed but we'll end up somewhere near I'm sure. If you're lucky we might even land near your home!

We have an excellent safety record in fact our standards are so high even hijackers don't dare fly with us!

I have great pleasure in letting you know that since the start of this year, over 50% of our passengers have reached their destinations. For the ones who didn't, our staff have maps to the nearest pubs and we had one for the roads but Kelly had a birthday last year and she wanted a hat.

Our seats are comfortable enough for you to have a nap, but not to sit on for long. If the engines are too loud, just let us know and we'll be happy to turn them off for you.

Unfortunately the in-flight movie is unavailable as Darragh forgot to record it last night, but if you look out the window you may see a pigeon.

On the off-chance you see any smoke in the cabin please don't panic - it's just the early warning system telling us theres an issue with the engines!

Now, please be seated and fasten your seat belts as we prepare for takeoff. For those who can't find a seat belt just hold on to the armrests as tight as you can, and for those who can't find a seat, a flight attendant will be happy to give you a stool.

I'm sorry but i won't be able to fly with you today as my wife has a wedding today but please make yourself at home and feel free to fly yourselves.

Mike hisses back, ""Are you bleeding crazy? People will see us!""

Jack replies, ""No, no, they're all asleep. Look."" He rises up and asks loudly, ""Can anyone please spare an extra blanket for me?"". No answer. Laying back down, he says ""See, Mike? No issues."".

The second scientist said “ I’ll have some H20 ... also.”, thus avoiding a subtle but dangerous misinterpretation.

The bartender said “ If you guys aren’t drinking alcohol, then I’ll have to charge you for the waters.”

The two scientists both thought about the possibility of making jokes about subatomic particles that would use the term charge in a different way than the bartender. Ultimately they decided not to risk it and ordered some hot wings which although not alcohol still satisfied the need for the establishment to generate income from customers. The bar was named De Cartes Horse, which might mean that geometry jokes would go over better than chemistry puns anyway.

The bartender, Ray, seethed as he placed the order with the cook/ bar back. He caressed the bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide next to his aluminum baseball bat and hoped he would get to use one of these things soon. Since they were hidden below the bar, he could touch them many times throughout the evening. He knew he needed help because his internal dialogue had stopped. He decided not to do anything different that day although he could feel his split brain pouting. 

Ray tried to think back to a time when he didn’t want to hurt others. Instead he only looked ahead, in one direction and slightly askew to where this would all end up. He couldn’t see an endpoint.

She noticed that the Seven Dwarves had huddled some distance from her...","... and, as they argued amongst themselves, they kept throwing looks her way. After some time, one of them separated from the group to approach her. It was Doc.

“Good morning, Mother Sister. I mean Mother Superior. Really sorry to bother you, but could you help us settle an argument?”

“Well, I shall try my best,” said the head nun.

“Mother Superior, do you have any nuns under your care at this convent that are three feet tall?”

Surprised at the question, the Mother Superior said, “No, I’m afraid we do not. We would have welcomed anyone of that height if they had asked, but no one of that description has even visited us here.”

“I see. Thank you very much, Mother Superior,” said Doc, and he went back to his group, and his arrival promptly reignited their argument.

The head nun ignored them and continued her work. She enjoyed a few minutes of concentration, when suddenly, a powerful sneeze, followed by a rain of falling leaves, caught her attention. It was Sneezy.

“Pardon my intrusion, Mother Superior. We’re having a discussion right now, and we’re hoping you could help us settle things,” he said, in between sneezes.

“Very well, what is it then?”

“Mother Superior, is there a nun here who is about three feet tall?”

Annoyed, the Mother Superior answered firmly, “No. Just as I told your friend earlier, we don’t have any nun with that height here. I may not be overly close to all of the nuns, but I know each and every one of those under my care here. None of them are of that height.”

“Ah, sorry then, Mother Superior. Thank you,” said Sneezy, and headed back to the group. The sounds of argument resumed.

By then, the Mother Superior was plenty irritated. The Bishop was scheduled to drop by later that day, and she still had so much to do. It didn’t help that all the nuns were daft to the last girl, leaving her to do everything, and if she had to deal with just ONE more silliness, she’d –

“Hey Sister.”

“WHAT THE HELL IS IT?” snarled Mother Superior.

“Whoa, whoa, calm down there, Sister,” said Grumpy. “You’re getting a tad grumpy.”

Her entire body shaking as she tried to control her temper and not do anything she would regret, the Mother Superior said, through gritted teeth, “What. Is. It.”

Grumpy raised his hand to the area in front of his forehead. “Sister, you got any nuns around this height-”

Almost spitting with rage, the Mother Superior said, “None! There are none! There never has been one, ever! And God forbid if one ever shows up, I will personally put her in a box and mail her to you. Good day!”

For a moment Grumpy looked as if he was about to ask the Mother Superior if she was sure, but then thought the better of it. He thanked the nun, and started plodding towards the group. He raised his hands, palms up, and shook his head.

Briefly, the dwarves were quiet, and then six of them started to laugh like maniacs, with some dancing. The Mother Superior threw them her sharpest look, but they were too busy to notice her.

As the drunk stood there, unsteady on his feet, staring down at the sheets, a hospital security guard who head been alerted my the screams and cursing, walked up and asked, ""What the world is going on here?""

The drunk, out of breath and staring down with a horrified look at the heap laying at his feet, replied: ""I am not sure, but I think I just beat the shit out of a ghost!""

After picking out a box of a dozen eggs, the man caught a glimpse of a golden shine coming through a slightly opened door to his left. The man asks the farmer about the light and is taken aback when the farmer hurries over to the door and closes it. The farmer then says quickly that there is nothing important behind the door and goes back to selling eggs to the man before ushering him out of the front door.

The man goes home but curiosity gets the better of him and he breaks into the farmhouse that same night. After reaching the strange door, he slowly creaks it open and his jaw drops to the floor. The most beautiful and intricate throne sits in the centre of the room. A solid gold seat encrusted with gems polished to sparkle like stars. On this throne, to the surprise of the man, was just a one legged chicken.

A crash came from behind him as the man hears the farmers voice calling,

‘Get out whoever you are, I’m armed and dangerous’

The man swings around and is face to face with a shotgun barrel.

‘Please sir, don’t shoot’ says the man. ‘I was only curious about what was in this room. Why does this chicken have such a nice throne in a room if it’s own?’

The farmer lowers his shotgun and says to the man, ‘well this is no ordinary chicken you see. This is the most incredible chicken in the world. This chicken can walk around the house, cooking food, washing the dishes, cleaning my clothes, feeding the other chickens, collecting the eggs, raising the little chicks, it handles all of my finances, babysits for my children, repair all of my farm equipment. You name it he does it. Hell he even lays golden eggs and has saved my farm from bankruptcy many times. I keep him protected in this room because he’s so valuable.’

The man is astonished. He is lost for words and just stared at this chicken in awe. After a few moments the man comes to his senses, looks at the farmer and asks,

‘But why does he only have one leg? was there a terrible accident or maybe jealous farmers trying to kidnap him? The poor creature, how could this happen?’

The doctor is pretty fast with his diagnosis:“your brain is too big, you’re just to smart. I recommend to downsize your brain in a surgery, it’s a standard procedure.“ The professor agrees and makes an appointment for his surgery.

The surgery goes well. The doctors are standing around the professors bed in the recovery room and wait for him to wake up.

The professor opens his eyes and says:“we learned from adorno that truth is objective and not plausible“

The doctors look at each other and agree:“this man is still too smart“. So they decide to repeat the operation and downsize his brain a little more.

Same scenario, same people, same room, just a surgery later. The professor opens his eyes and directly starts talking: „the late Phoenician society was characterized by a concentration of power...“

The doctors start to be pissed and say to each other: „this won’t help, we need to remove half of the brain or we’re still doing these surgeries until next year.“

After that decision is made and the professor agreed for another surgery they finally start to remove 50% of his brain. 

The treatment goes well although the doctors are very nervous: never before have they removed so much brain from just one person.

A couple of hours later, the medical team is optimistically waiting in the recovery room for the professor to wake up.

Finally, he opens his eyes and gazes at the medical team. Nobody says a word. After a couple of seconds the professor - still gazing at them - says:

The cat replies, “My life was hard. I spent my days sleeping on a hard wooden floor, chasing my food all my days. May I have a pillow so I can spend my days in heaven in comfort?” St Peter obliges and the cat takes his well deserved rest. 

A few days later, three mice show up. St Peter also permits them into heaven and grants them a request. 

The mice tell St Peter, “We spent our whole lives running away from predators. Could we have some skates so we can get from place to place faster?” Skates suddenly appear on each of the mice’s feet and St Peter sends them on their way.

A few hours later, St Peter goes to check in on the cat.

“I just wanted to see how heaven has been for you so far. Has it been everything you hoped?”

“It’s been wonderful,” the cat replied. “I’ve not had to chase anything and I’ve been able to spend my days content, lazy, and comfortable. I’ve especially loved the meals on wheels you’ve been sending by, that’s the best part!”

As the tiger approached ready to devour him for breakfast, the dog turned its back to the tiger, resiliently stuck a big bone in its mouth and said loudly: ""Yum, this tiger was absolutely delicious, I wonder if there are any more tasty tigers around here"". The tiger hearing this pumped his brakes, turned around and ran back scared into the woods. 

 A monkey who sat on the tree branch above and saw everything, decided it was a good opportunity for him to make things good with the tiger. He chased the tiger and stopped it. He told the tiger what the dog had done and how he'd made a fool out of him. ""Oh yeah?"" said the angry tiger, ""I'll show that little piece of shit dog what happens to those who dare to mess around with me. Hop on my back monkey let's go get that dog!""

The dog, still shaken from the previous incident, saw the tiger running towards him at full speed this time with a monkey on its back. Instead of running away, the dog decided to sit with his back to his attackers and seconds before the tiger reached him, said out loud, ""Where is that annoying monkey?

ACETAMINOPHEN

All drugs have two names, a trade name and generic name.
Example, the trade name is Tylenol and its generic name is Acetaminophen... Aleve is also called Naproxen.
Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.
 
The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra.
 
After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin.
Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.
Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer..
It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one.
 
Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of 'cocktails', 'highballs' and just a good old-fashioned 'stiff drink'.
Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.

His sister bought a pair of knickers for herself at the same time. Harrods had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Ron got the knickers. Good old Ron sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter:

Dear Sasha,

I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled at all.
I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.
I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.

All my love
Ron.

At that very moment, he spots Andy Samberg double fisting a bourbon and beer near the bar. 

Excusing himself from Mickelson, he explains that he has an action-comedy script he’s been shopping around to Hollywood studios that he thinks Samberg would be absolutely perfect for. 

Chan makes his way over to the usually genial Samberg and introduces himself.

Unbeknownst to him, however, Samberg is in no mood for polite conversation, let alone networking.

In fact, he’s spent the last hour in the bar pounding drinks and brooding over his poor performance: a dismal 17 shots over par. 

Believing that the new movie idea could be his biggest hit since Rush Hour, Chan persists and starts to give his elevator pitch. 

Before Chan can finish his first sentence, Samberg interrupts by punching him in the face and drunkenly slurring something about payback for Pearl Harbor. 

Astonished, Chan yells, “You ignorant fool! That was Japan. I’m Chinese!”

Still slurring, and now swaying to and fro, Samberg mutters, “Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese...what’s the difference?”

To that, Chan delivers a swift and decisive blow across Samberg’s face which knocks him to the floor.

Hardly remembering the events that led to his unfortunate situation, Samberg sheepishly groans, “what was that for?”

Uncharacteristically, Chan booms, “THAT WAS FOR THE TITANIC!”

“C’mon man! The Titanic? That was an iceberg!” 

Smiling, Chan shrugs and replies, “Samberg, Goldberg, iceberg...what’s the difference?”

In a trial, a Southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said, 

'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.'
