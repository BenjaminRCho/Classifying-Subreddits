1,The time that providing after hours support may have saved my life.,"I will do my best to anonymize this story as best I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

This tale goes back to my time working for a local government. I was a member of that organization's helpdesk. As a helpdesk employee, there was generally no overtime or after hours work. When your eight hours for the day were up,  you were done. There was one exception. The helpdesk provided IT support for city council meetings. These meetings started at either 4pm or 5pm and happened three times per month. A typical meeting might last 2-3 hours, but some meetings went on for 8+ hours. They were always on the same weeknight. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was not that weeknight. My girlfriend had called me and expressed an interest in going to see a movie with a friend of ours. I got off work at 5pm, but our friend worked until 6pm. My girlfriend and I had planned to grab a light supper before the movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss came in at 4pm and informed me that there was a budget meeting starting at 5pm and since it was my turn in the rotation, I would have to cover it. I called my g/f to let her know that I had to work late and I had no idea how late it would be. She decided to go hang out at her favorite coffee shop a few miles away from the theater until I could let her know what was going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

The meeting was relatively uneventful. The video streaming software that recorded the meeting crashed a couple of times, which was not unusual. Otherwise, the meeting went off without a hitch and actually ended around 6:30. I let my g/f and friend know that I was now free and made my way to the theater. City hall was much closer to the theater than either of them and they both needed a little time to get ready, so I was sitting in the parking lot of the theater on a conference call with them as we tried to work out what movie we were going to see. 

&amp;#x200B;

We finally decided on a movie and ended the call after maybe 10-15 minutes. I was tasked with buying tickets for us all so that we wouldn't have any delays getting in to see the movie. I was maybe 20-30 feet from the ticket counter when the doors burst open and people running out. It was surreal to see these people moving QUICKLY, but with very little sound. The only thing I heard people say was ""Get in the car!"".  I stood there for maybe a second or two trying to process what was going on when the person whose car was closest to me got close enough for me to hear him telling the 911 operator that there was an active shooter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I turned and ran back to my car to tell my g/f and friend NOT to come to the theater. Each of those calls probably took 10 seconds or so. By the time I was able to start my car, the first police car had rolled into the parking lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend later asked why I hadn't gone back in to help. Besides being an IT tech, I'm also a firearms instructor and concealed carry instructor in my state. I asked him how he would differentiate between an active shooter and a good samaritan with a concealed handgun permit. I asked him how the police entering the theater would know whether \*I\* was the active shooter or a good samaritan with a concealed handgun permit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife still believes that fate presented me with some unexpected overtime to prevent us from being in that theater...",False,1210,143,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
2,That time I flew to Mongolia to turn the volume down,"I'm an audiovisual consultant and automation (Crestron) programmer. On the side I'm an aviation geek. I love my job for the free travel but sometimes... well.. sometimes I wind up with a weird one. 


Like last week. 


One of our ""clients""* is a super cool non-profit/NGO with a mission to further medical education for fixing/preventing problems with a particular part of the body in developing countries. As part of the program they have an aircraft fitted out with a classroom, operating room, etc., etc., -- totally self-sufficient if they need to be, including water purification, generating their own medical oxygen, etc. [this would be so much easier if I weren't trying to keep things anonymous ;) ] 

Like I said: Cool group, cool mission, and as an aviation geek: I get to work on/around a very cool plane. When the opportunity first presented itself several years ago, I was 150% on board. 

Anyway, one of the complaints/concerns since my last visit--somewhere much less exotic--was that audio on some of the recordings sounded distorted. 

99.9% of the time this is because the volume into the recorder (or somewhere else in the signal chain) is too high and 'clipping'. 

I got a sample of an affected recording and sure enough, I'm even more convinced that's the problem. And I asked them to try turning it down. 

The client's team had some concern about being qualified to turn the volume down themselves. 

So I wound up on a plane, flew from the US to Mongolia (via China), turned the volume down... confirmed the problem was resolved. And flew home. 

Obviously, that wasn't the only thing I accomplished -- one of the big wish list items had been to observe an actual program to see where we can drive improvements and that was the most valuable accomplishment -- but if felt weird starting the trip with the official to-do list being, entirely: 

Turn volume down.

3,Dead Cell Phone short-ish,"Haven't posted in a while, and this one really got me today. I cover a bunch of offices for the company I work for, and I got a call from this guy that went like this:

""Hey, my cell phone is dead""

""Dead, dead? Or something isn't working?""

""Dead, dead. I can't load the internet""

""Can you get to the internet?""

""Yes""

""Well then it isn't dead""

""I mean no. The screen won't come on. Can you help me? I need a new phone""

6,Not A Good Fit,"I try and go a good bit before I start posting stories here, kind of let them pile up--plus it's hard to find the time to sit and write them out.  This one I had to share because I feel it's more of a PSA--it's short*ish*, too.

Background/Characters:  **Me** (owner of a local tech company, but I also handle the majority of calls, repairs, etc.)  vs.  **Non-Profit Lady** (NPL from here on out).


*Phone rings*
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:**  Thanks for calling _____, how can I help you?
&gt; 
&gt; **NPL:**  Hello, I work for ________, a non-profit organization and we are currently *very unhappy* with our current tech support---they are too far away, charge a lot to come on site, and aren't helping us at all!  Do you all do networking?  I'm looking at your site and I don't see anything here about what you guys do...

This here is a red flag because my site is designed for the most incompetent of people and explicitly says we do small/medium networking/office support, but to be thorough, I want to know what she means by ""networking.""
 
&gt; **Me:**  All right well our website does state, if you click on the large icon that says ""SERVICES,"" that we do handle small / medium sized businesses, which includes networking.  Now, when you say ""networking,"" do you know the scope of work/type of setup you're looking for, or already have in place?
&gt; 
&gt; **NPL:**  Do you do networking?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:**  Yes, we do, but I would need specifics on what it is you're looking for--I know that might be a difficult question, but I'm asking to make sure that we can help you.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **NPL:**  So you do networking?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** ....Yes ma'am, but it depends on what you mean and the nature--what's the nature of your business in terms of what you guys do over your network day-to-day?  Are you referring to a local network in the office?  Servers?  A database?

&gt; **NPL:**  (*sounding frustrated*)  We're a non-profit organization that ...(*she goes on to describe what the non-profit does rather than answer the question.*)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:**  Okay, I just mean, what I'm trying to get to the bottom of here is what is it that your business currently asks of your current tech company, that we would be providing?  Does that make sense?  

 It's important to note here that not once was I angry, frustrated, or anything other than polite to this lady.  I assume she had a moment of anger with her current tech support and called me in a rage with no real information or plan in mind.
 
&gt; **NPL:**  Ok well, I don't think this is going to be a good fit.

 I smiled when she said that--maybe because I know I dodged a bullet, or because in just dealing with this person I too knew that this would end badly and certainly wasn't a good fit.

&gt; **Me:**  Ok!  No problem and good luck!


I should say that I like helping people figure out what they need and providing solutions for them, but they've got to know what it is they need and what they expect from me and my company.  

If you call a support company and just say ""DO NETWORKING FOR ME!"" into the phone they're probably not going to be much help.  Maybe I need to get better at asking questions to get to the root of what people really need, but then again, I've never encountered a person who just repeats the same questions and non-answers and expects me to just say, ""Yes we can do all of the things you *have not mentioned once in your non-answers!*""

So PSA to companies in search of tech support:  Know what you need, what you want, what your expectations are before you call---or at least be willing to talk it out with the tech provider to reach those goals *together.*",False,44,9,DroopyScrotum,talesfromtechsupport
7,A Near-Death Experience,"Hi! Been a while since I posted. I have been replacing a bunch of old $Hell $Perspireon desktops to brand stinking new $IQ $ProfessionalFurniture small form factor desktops. Quite beastly, no spinning storage, it's basically a laptop but in a desktop format. Now you can imagine, a PC not moved for a few years is bound to be a dusty, maybe a few cobwebs. But, let me share with you what I found.

I was sent to bring the old $Hell computers from the main to the satellite office and replace the older than dirt AIOs that were in the satellite office. However, front desk gets a brand spanking new $ProfessionalFurniture lap-desktop. As I'm unplugging the old one, I notice that the power strip is covered with spider/cob webs (maintenance apparently has been slacking) and proceed with no difference. Then I see... it. 

It was a [BLACK WIDOW](https://www.desertusa.com/insects/black-widow-spider.html) (link included for those fortunate to have never seen them), and It was about 2 inches from my hand, and VERY angry that I just destroyed it's house. I, while nearly simultaneously sh*tting myself, scream and pull my hand back as fast as I could, grab the nearest cardboard box, and start smashing all around and on the power strip. However, I don't see any splatters on the box. That means that death machine is around. (If you're confused on why I am so scared, the only cure for a black widow bite is to sit in pain and agony for 24 straight hours while being injected adrenaline to keep your heart pumping, and if you go out, you're out for good.)

I finish the install using a piece of foam from the monitor box so I don't reach my hand near that power strip, and do it in record time. The cabling looks like my underwear at the time, but it all works (thank God) and I start to configure the computer.

I tell the person (old clueless lady who has a track record for not listening to IT or management) who works at that desk this whole situation, they say ""oh okay"" and sit right down and start working, despite my many warnings to NOT do just that. Well, if they won't listen, they can die. They're still alive, but that is WAY too close for comfort for me. When I asked about what she would do if she sees the spider, she says she will grab the hand sanitizer bottle and spray it on the spider... yeah, good luck. That'll just make it clean. And more angry.

10,He surely does not understand what we are saying!,"Hi TFTS!

LTL, FTP, Non-Native Speaker you know the drill.
Also sorry if I screw up the formatting, this is my first properly formatted post so please bear with me. (rawr)

This is not a story that happened to me, but a colleague of a very good friend when she was working at $SP in the past.   
$SP was providing a pretty niche application called $software and are one of the largest providers for this type of application in europe. Thus having customers that aren't native to (Common Language) is not unusual. Most customers are pretty nice, but as always there are some rotten eggs in the basket.  
Also since this story features text spoken in multiple languages I'll denote the spoken language with () before each line

Let's introduce our characters for this tale, shall we?

&gt; $FT: Friendly Tech - Tech support that gets sent out by $SP to fix issues customers have or install new software updates  
&gt; $GC: Grumpy Customer - Doesn't understand why he even has to pay for software  
&gt; $AA: Annoying Assistant - When in doubt, the boss is always right!

The weather was sunny and the road clear. $FT was pretty happy - $SP had recently released an update to $software and so he was sent out to customers far and wide to bring them ~~gifts of joy~~ a new version of $software. This time around he had to go to $GC known for expertly wielding profanities, as $FT recalled from his time when he was working as a mere level 1 helpdesk ~~monkey~~ support. He started his journey at 6AM driving around 4 hours to finally get to the customer.  
Arriving on-site and $GC was already waiting with $AA.

&gt; $FT: (Common) [INSERT DEFAULT GREETING]. I'm here to update you to the latest version of $software.  
&gt; $GC: (Common) Ah, great that you're here! The PC with $software installed is right over here!

Needless to say $FT was more than a bit surprised - it seemed $GC was one of those customers that bark but don't bite. While he followed $GC to the PC, $GC was having a conversation with $AA.

&gt; $GC: (Troll) That dumbf@#* is finally here. It's already 10AM - doesn't he know some people have to work!  
&gt; $AA: (Troll) And as always when $SP updates $software everything goes to sh@# all the time!  
&gt; $GC: (Troll) I don't get why we have to pay that much for this piece of cr%@ $software!

$FT continued to the PC and not even an hour later $software was updated, he had checked that the printer worked and it properly backed up to the customers local backup solution. While he was doing so $GC and $AA continued cursing him and $SP.  

&gt; $GC: (Troll) I bet those suckers at $SP told him to take his time with updating $software and doing all kinds of unnecessary sh%# so they can charge even more for this!  
&gt; $AA: (Troll) Why did he have to check the printer as well? It *always* works without any issues!

Bear in mind that $GC like many other clients of $SP regularly called in because their stuff is broken. $FT had already helped fix their *always working* printer back in his days at helpdesk.

&gt; $FT: (Common) Anything else I can help you with?  
&gt; $GC: (Common) No, thank you very much!  
&gt; $FT: (Troll) Good! I'll be taking my leave. Have a *wonderful* day.  

It was at this moment $GC and $AA realized they had fucked up - majorly. While $FT did not look like it, he was half troll and even his last name was a typical troll name. As such he also spoke troll natively. With a grin on his face $FT left the premise. The rumors from helpdesk said that $GC had become a rather 'tame' customer after this whole incident. While $SP did not give one single f about how their helpdesk or technicians were treated, if word reached them that a customer talked sh#$ about them, they were dropped like a hot potato. 

TL;DR: Customer thought he could talk sh#$ about the company and the tech in another language for nearly an hour while the tech was native in said language.

12,CLIR or how I learned to stop worrying and just post to reddit,"Hello there!

First time TFTS, be gentle!

Today's story revolves around the wonderful shenanigans of plain telephony.

I work for an internet/phone provider. Due to some construction work, 1st level techs, 2nd level techs &amp; complaint management share a pretty big temporary office.

Customer calls in an issue: there's a single phone number in Germany they can't reach, which is clearly our fault and we should fix it. Colleague creates a trouble ticket. I am the lucky one to get the assignment. We first check their line. Everything's working fine. We test the destination number from our end. Can reach the number without problems. We let the customer test several national and international numbers. All work fine. Only this single one number they can't reach. Since there's nothing out of the ordinary I consult with our voice expert. He double-checks all settings, looks perfectly fine, only difference to our own test line it the customer has CLIR (calling line identification restriction aka. hiding your phone number) active. So we enable the feature on our end and try again. Suddenly we can't reach the destination number. Disabling it for the customer line, informing them about it and asking them to make the call. Works like a charm. Apparently the destination number automatically rejects all calls with CLIR active. Alright.

So I call the customer and inform them about that. Explain that there's nothing 'wrong' at our end, but the destination number automatically rejects calls that don't show the originating number and that if they want to reach the number have to turn CLIR off via a code on the phone. Took a time but they got it (or at least I felt like they've understood). Called the destination number and explained the same thing to them, in case they weren't aware that they had this feature active. Case close. 

Suddenly colleague XY reopens the ticket. Said customer wants us to fix the issue, as they want to call *every* number without sending their own. So I call the customer again and explain to them - again - that this is out of our power. It's not us that prevents them from reaching the destination number, it's the destination number's settings that automatically block calls with active CLIR. So far so good. Case closed.

A while later colleague ZA taps me on the shoulder. ZA works in complaint management. Apparently said customer filed a complaint an hour later, since they ""can't reach a certain number in Germany without sending their phone number"" and is threatening to cancel her landline. Told ZA what was up again and that there's no solution to their problem (unless the destination number changes their policy). When ZA asked if I could call the customer back and explain it to them I respectfully decline though....",False,97,7,GallantGentleman,talesfromtechsupport
13,The humble restart,"Last school year I was helping my school's IT department when my Fitness teacher came to me:

Him: &gt;My compute won't work.

Me: &gt;What do you mean 'it won't work'

Him: &gt;I don't know

Me: &gt;Bring it here

As he is going off to grab the ""not working"" computer, I begin to type up an email to IT expecting it to be an issue out of my scope. (didn't ever send that email)

Him: &gt;Here it is

Looking at the screen, it was on the login screen and there was some error with an ""ok"" button, and no input device worked, not the trackpad, the trackpoint or keyboard. 

Me: &gt;Watch this

-powers the computer off and on-

Me: &gt;Login so I can see if that fixed the issue.

-He logs in-


-error never popped up again-


The following day, the same teacher comes to me saying that his computer is buzzing and to com to his office after class, again expecting the worst, I go and start typing up an email to IT. (never sent that one either)

Class ends and I walk into his office hearing a buzzing noise, as I walk up to the computer, I notice that it is not coming from the computer, but from the PC speakers...

-unplugs the audio jack from the computer, and plugs it back in making sure that it is fully seated in the computer-

-Silence-

14,The dreaded knowledgebase...,"I once worked a contract job for a local government as a helpdesk employee. That contract lasted roughly one year.

​

A couple of years later, the helpdesk at this local government was short handed and hiring for full time positions. Hiring new people happens at the speed of government, which meant that the helpdesk was short handed for almost six months by the time they hired me. There were TWO helpdesk techs supporting roughly 1200 users. I was ""fast tracked"" because I had worked well with this team and was already familiar with the policies and procedures.

​

When I was hired, each of those techs had well over 100 old tickets in their queues and they were falling behind daily. It was assumed by those techs and by me that I would immediately start picking up tickets and helping them with their backlog. We were wrong. I was immediately assigned exclusively to the rollout of a new antivirus software, which took close to three months. The day I was released to work on tickets, I had over 100 tickets in my queue.

​

With my help, we were able to clear out some of the backlog. I mostly handled OLD tickets and new emergencies, while letting the other two try to dig out their own queues. The CIO, in his infinite wisdom, hired \*THREE\* contractors to give us a hand... or so we thought...

​

Those THREE contractors which would have been \*SO\* helpful to dig out the helpdesk backlog were instead hired to write a ""knowledgebase"" that was supposed to help us do our jobs. It took over a year to complete this ""knowledgebase"". These three contractors would hold meetings in the tech area, pester the techs about common problems, pester the programmers about their projects, and generally demand documentation on everything. So, not only did they not help the helpdesk close any tickets, they took an active role in slowing us down. When the knowlegebase was finally revealed, we learned that it was a software knowlegebase.

​

Our CIO gave us glowing reports of how wonderful the knowledgebase was and suggested that we start using it immediately. A month or so passes with none of the techs using the knowledgebase and we have some new meetings again extolling the virtues of the knowledgebase and suggestions that we start using it. We were told to bring examples of how we used the knowledgebase to the next staff meeting. At the next staff meeting, again, none of us can show that we used the knowledgebase at all. This initiates a furious dressing down of all the helpdesk techs and how we are lazy and ungrateful and we should be using the knowlegebase for the sake of efficiency. He demands that we show tickets where we used the knowledgebase for the next staff meeting, or there will be ""repercussions"". Even with these threats over my head, I was only able to show that I used the knowledgebase ONCE.

​

A user contacted me about not being able to send an email to some particular recipient. A few seconds of looking at the return email shows that there was no such recipient. A few more seconds of looking through the users inbox, shows that the user typoed the recipient's email address. I then sent him a link to the knowledgebase on how to use Outlook. This would not in any way help the user to not make a typo, but it was the closest thing to using the knowledgebase that I had run across. You see... our shiny new knowledgebase was about software and how to use it. There were sections on word, excel, outlook, and the various and sundry programs that were used throughout the organization.

​

More than ninety-five percent of the calls received by the helpdesk were not about how to use the software. The tickets we got were about hardware failures, software failures, malware, password resets, etc. etc. etc. Pretty much nobody ever asked us how to use any particular piece of software. This made it almost impossible to use this new knowledgebase for much of anything.

​

When the next staff meeting came along and once again, we could only barely show that we used the knowledgebase at all... The CIO lost all of his bluster and asked us WHY we weren't using the knowledgebase more. We responded that we simply did not get tickets about how to use any particular software... we got tickets when something went wrong at a hardware or software level. By and large, the people either knew how to use the software or got along without it. So... the CIO got a gleam in his eye and asked us to start writing HARDWARE articles for his new knowledgebase. I chose to write an article on a very common problem, ""My computer won't come on."" It was BEAUTIFUL... it had full color pictures and closeups. It showed both ends of a computer power cable and pictures of what they should be plugged into. It explained in great detail that the computer could not operate without electricity. It had a picture of the power switch on the most common computer in use.

​

Before I could get into trouble for the epic levels of snark in this document, a new mayor was elected and the CIO was summarily dismissed. The three contractors were also summarily dismissed and as far as I know, the new knowledgebase was deleted and never spoken of again. By this time, the helpdesk had FINALLY dug out from under the backlog and was operating reasonably efficiently. Especially since the contractors were no longer pestering us for documentation of systems that for security reasons could not be published.

​

​\*\*EDITED to add some background and/or details\*\*

​

I feel it might be useful to add a few details. First, the technicians had access to multiple resources for resolving issues. The ticketing system we used had a built-in knowledgebase that was only accessible to the technicians. We wrote the articles for that knowledgebase and while it was a little sparse, it contained some very important information. We only put in articles that were relevant to our work and we didn't bother putting in articles for obvious solutions. We also had a network shared ""tech"" folder that contained installation instructions, software, manuals etc. The CIO wanted his knowledgebase to be publicly accessible for self training. It was huge, difficult to navigate, and for the most part had the documentation that came with whatever software copy/pasted into it. For example, I'm pretty sure the entire help system from outlook was pasted into it. Again, we didn't really get calls about how to USE software, so the resource was largely useless.

15,Netnotworking Sidestory: Cables. Lots of cables.,"Hey, long time no see!

Been away for a bit, some nice two and a half weeks of vacation completely off the grid.

This is not a netnotworking story, but just the general craziness of things over here. And it's a rather short one.

*****

**Backstory**

I consider myself as a very friendly person. Being nice to people is what helps you avoid problems or helps you quickly solve them. This is why i tend to befriend people around me that i might need help from. No matter if it's facility management, logistics, external craftsmen, whatever.

So the guy relevant for this story is one of those craftsmen. A bit old, funny, no BS guy. He's always around even though he's working for a contractor. I'll call him Jerry in this story, because of the cat. Usually he's the guy that does non-power cabling for us, be it fiber or twisted pair. He also does desk wiring. The desk wiring is the relevant part this time, he was busy wiring some desks with those USB3 Docking stations. Remember those docking stations for IBM/Lenovo laptops? Like that, just with a single USB3 cable. 

As we are in the process of getting a few new buildings up and running, Jerry is always busy on the construction site and knows the most current state of it. This is also the perfect excuse for me to sneak from my desk and ~~kill some time without anyone knowing where i am and bothering me~~ inform myself about the current state of affairs. 

*****

It was a hot sunny day, shortly before my vacation. I was donning a shit-eating grin on our post-lunch walk around the location that was conveniently built on a hill right in the middle of a valley, all surrounded by small forests and humongous vineyards. Though the scenery was not the reason for said grin, but the jealousy of my colleagues at my attire. As usual i did not give a damn and decided to wear shorts to work.

Our walk leads us through the whole parking lot that by now completely surrounds the fairly large location - about 6000 people work here by now, two years ago i was one of the first over 4000th. Just as we went back onto company premises, a well known yellow van pulls up to us.

&gt; me: Hi.

&gt; Jerry: Hi.

&gt; me: How's it going with construction? *grin*

&gt; Jerry: *clearly sarcastic* Ready for move in!

&gt; me: Heh. What's up?

&gt; Jerry: Do you have a few cables?

&gt; me: What kind of cables? And define ""a few"" please.

&gt; Jerry: Like...350 or so. USB3 cables, 3 meters.

&gt; me: Nope, Network guy, not my kind of cable. But WTF? Why do you need so many?

&gt; Jerry: Ah, yeah...Well...remember those dockers? We're busy wiring those nicely into the tables and after doing a pair or two, we decided to test them. They don't work.

&gt; me: Whut?

&gt; Jerry: Well...partially. The keyboards and mice attached to them work, network does too. But the two displays don't. If we take a completely different USB3 cable than the ones we have, it all works perfectly fine. Which means we're in need of cables. Lots of cables.

&gt; me: Soo...did local IT order those?

&gt; Jerry: Nope.

&gt; me: Well, there is your problem.

&gt; Jerry: Yup...but at least i have an excuse to not be crawling under desks for now. Gotta go. See ya.

**TL;DR:** These are not the cables you're looking for.

dev: Yes. We only run this once in a while. We moved to new servers six months ago but we haven't tested it until now.

me: OK. Well, foo has never been in DNS, and we can't look at the host files from bar and baz because they're gone.

dev: can you restore them from backup?

me: No, those backups are long gone.

me: Yes, but it doesn't exist in DNS, so you're not going to be able to.

dev: Can you put it in DNS?

me: If you tell me what it pointed to.

dev: Can you point it to where it used to go?

me: .... OK, what server does it run on?

dev: [foo.example.com](https://foo.example.com)

me: I'm not going to be able to help you unless you tell me the ACTUAL name of that server. We don't have a server with that name or anything even close to that name.

17,“I want you to help me but I don’t want to answer your questions so you can actually help me”,"Cross posted from r/talesfromcallcenters

Hey all, story time of a fun little call I had a couple weeks back from a lady who was the equivalent of a “can I speak to your manager” haircut, personified. 

I’ve posted on here a couple times before, the company I work for makes software that is for body shops and dealerships, so depending on the day I may get spammed with really nice people who “don’t really know how to use a computer, but can you please help me” or people that just need a password reset or forgot a username. This call was one of those hellacious calls where I resisted the urge to lose my cool several times over. We’re gonna call her “cust” because otherwise I’ll think of something much more rude to call her. 

Me: “customer support, this is X”

Cust: “You need to help me use ‘the link’” (our software program)

Me: “Sure! Have you used it before, or have you watched any of the self help videos in our support section? Was there something specific with it you had questions on?”

Cust: (Begins to actually scream into the phone): “I don’t have time for this, I don’t know how to use the link and you need to help me right now and stop asking me questions!”

Me: “Ma’am, I am trying to help you, but I’m trying to figure out if you ever used the link before, or if you’re a first time user. Please do not raise your voice to me, as I am simply trying to help.”

Cust: (Starts yelling even louder): “I AM NOT YELLING AT YOU. YOU NEED TO HELP ME OR GET ME YOUR MANAGER.”

Me: “Ma’am, you haven’t told me what the problem is, how am I supposed to help if I don’t know what you need?”
Cust: “I told you, I don’t know how to use the link and you need to help me!”

(At this point I assume she’s either a first time user or someone who hasn’t used it in a long time, so I prepare to remote in and give her a full walkthrough of the program.)

Me: “Okay, can I get your account’s phone number so I can pull up your profile? I’m going to remote in to help you.”

Cust: “Finally! It’s 800-FUC-KOFF.” (She didn’t say that, but damn was I thinking it.)

(At this point I pull up their account see they’re pretty active, having called in a couple weeks ago for assistance with files not pulling through the link. We also just released a major update to our software so older windows versions like XP and vista are no longer supported.)

Me: (walks her through the steps of remoting me in, which normally takes 30-60 seconds tops, and takes us nearly 10 minutes.) “Okay, so I’m in, you have the link installed and running, so what seems to be the problem? You said you didn’t know how to use it at all, but you have it installed on here.” (Her PC is also slower than hell and looks to be running vista, if the 10 minutes to remote in didn’t clue you in.)

Cust: “It won’t work! I tried to send a file over but it won’t come into the website and you need to fix it for me!”

Me: “So, when you said you didn’t know how to use the system what you really meant is you knew how, but you couldn’t get a file through...?”

Cust: (Her tone suddenly changes as I trail off and let her sit there and think of how much of an idiot she’s being.) “Oh yeah, silly me that’s what I meant! It’s worked up until the last week or so! Btw, where are you located, how’s the weather out there?” (I shit you not, she went to stepford wife cheerful at the drop of a hat. Also, our update came out about a week ago, hmmm.)

Me: “Okay, so we did have an update come out about a week ago, did you happen to download and install it? It would have prompted you to do so.”

Cust: “YES. SO TELL ME WHY IT ISNT WORKING.” (Just like that, back to rude and snarky.)

Me: “Let me check a couple things -goes through basic verification steps I normally would have done before wasting my time to remote in, she answers okay to all of them-do you happen to know what version of windows you use?”

Cust: “No, I don’t know that, that shouldn’t matter at all.”

Me: “Actually it does, we upgraded the program so some versions are no longer supported.” (I then check the version of our tool and it isn’t the latest one.) “Okay, so you didn’t actually download the newest version of the tool, so that’s why it isn’t actually working.”

I go through the brief process of updating our tool, and lo and behold, it fails and says the operating system isn’t supported.

Cust: “That’s weird, we use vista so I don’t know why it wouldn’t work.”

Me: “You just said you didn’t know which version you used, and if so, that’s why it isn’t working anymore. “ (I check the system info, it’s fucking vista.) “Sorry ma’am, your pc has an unsupported version of windows for our program, due to our recent software upgrade. I’d suggest upgrading the pc as a whole as opposed to just installing the new OS. But I can’t fix this for you because it won’t work with our tool anymore!”

Cust: (Starts swearing at a man in the background and yells at him to upgrade the pc because it’s too old and she needs to use our program.)

That was a satisfying end to the call, sorry lady, but even if I wanted to help you, and at this point I definitely didn’t, I couldn’t.

18,Why you should triple check before unplugging,"So this happened today, let's start off with a bit of background. The company I work for has 2 racks in a co-location data centre (D and E) and they both have the same code back and front (So 1234 for all the rack doors, not the actual code but I like my job) and both racks have a 4U storage server at the bottom. All will become relevant very soon.

I get told to go downstairs and pull a specific cable out of the storage server in rack D. So I went down and unlocked rack E thinking it was rack D. I sit down to look at the server and look for any identifying marks to tell me what cable to unplug (I was told management port on controller 0 I was trying to identify which was 0) there was no identifying marks what so ever not even to identify from device A to device B.

So I tell my colleagues to keep an eye on the monitoring software and tell me if I unplug the wrong controller but I think it's this one as there no traffic going through it and the reason we were unplugging and re plugging was due to the controller being frozen.

I finally unplug the cable and wait, nothing from my colleagues so I'm pretty happy I unplugged the correct one. I plug it back in and go to check if the controller has come back when I realise I don't have my laptop so I go back upstairs and check but the controller still isn't working.

This time I take my laptop with me and unplug the server while looking at the GUI waiting for it to tell me link down but I refresh the page, link up so I refresh again, link up and do this multiple times I've the next 10 minutes but then also notice something else, the controller are showing management and port 1 as up on both controllers but only the first controller has a cable in port 1. At this point I realise something is truly screwed with this server.

I walk back upstairs and talk about it with my senior engineer and tell him about all these problems and spend 10 minutes discussing it and this is the first time I start doubting myself and check monitoring to see if anything else went down while doing this but nope nothing and I was pretty sure it was the right server.

After doubting myself I have to go down and check and it was at this point that that I realise my mistake so I message my senior engineer letting him know and complete the work on the correct server and saw the link go down almost as soon as I unplug it and back up when I plug it back in.

19,On the job training... or... I'm not perfect!,"Back to my time offshore. In this case, this was very, VERY early in my offshore career. This is in around 1997 or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our setup at this time included a data collection machine that collected data to a 9gb hard drive and a data processing machine that was also the fileserver and backup station. The processing machine had 27gb or so of  space in a software RAID... three data drives and a parity drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

The data collector could fill up that 9gb drive in two to three days. Due to storage capacity limitations, we had a policy of archiving the raw data as soon as possible. Every two to three days, I would copy all the data from the collection machine to the processing machine, archive the latest raw data to tape, process the raw data into a smaller processed form, then delete the raw data. Once the raw data was on tape, I would then delete the raw data off of the data collection machine. 

&amp;#x200B;

On one fateful day, I'm asked to dump the contents of a data CD to our ""RAID array"". I had just finished processing the last dump and had just archived raw data and cleaned off the collection machine. This was a very lucky thing. I ran the command to copy the entire disc to the RAID array and went to the galley to grab a bite to eat. I came back from lunch to see it still crunching away on the disc, which was very odd. About 45 minutes into the copy process, the processing machine crashed. This was also unusal. I had witnessed maybe two workstation crashes. The machine comes back up, but the data drive is not mounted. Hmm... That's not good. I attempt to run an fsck on the data drive, and I get an error from the RAID software that set0 has no members or some such ( I forget the exact error ). After an hour or so of reading manuals and trying everything to resurrect this drive, I admit defeat and call the office. They put me in touch with the local ""expert"" in recovering software RAIDs. We try several things and after a few hours, he admits defeat. We are now 8ish hours into this mess and about 4 hours after my shift is over. At this point, not only do I have to worry about getting everything up and running before the data collection machine runs out of space, I also need to have processed data so that we can see which areas need more data collected. For reasons that I will never fully understand, it took another twelve hours or so to actually rebuild the software RAID. Now I need to pull data from my latest full backup, which I completed a few hours before the crash. The restore took another 8ish hours. Then I had to pull data from the CD again, but this time I pulled the data across the network from a PC with a cdrom drive. That took another two hours. Then I started processing the last batch of raw data ( I had lost that data ). That took another 6 hours. Now, I need to hurry up and pull the data across from the collection machine, archive it to tape, clean off the data collection machine before it runs out of space, and process the latest batch of raw data. This took another 6 hours. I don't know if I have the math all done correctly, but I basically had to stay up and fight with this disaster for 48 hours straight. When I finally had everything caught up, cleaned up, backed up, and ready to go... I crashed for about 24 hours straight.

It has connections to web front end, to apps and certain other things so it can do all kinds of things, but the problem as always are  .... users ...

​

So onto the story. We have a special feature for the web store where you can enable certain clients to purchase up to user defined amount of products for free every X days. The HQ has been using this for a while, but one of the newer stores just started using this feature. I being the dashing and helpful dev helped them set it up and explained how the feature worked. After confirming that they knew what they were doing I let them be and got back to my regular work, so yesteday I got an email from them going something like this. $me = Me, $manager = manager of the new store.

Hello, $me

​

the feature that you set up for us to give some items away for free is not working, when we tried to use it we got a bill and now we do not know what to do. Please do fix it, I thought you said this works already...

​

So since I was busy with other work yesterday I didn't manage to look at the issue till today. First I tried the feature on localhost, then on dev server and it worked everywhere, I checked version control system and everything was up to date ... Hmmm, what could it be? So I went to check the logs ... Aaaand there it was. They created the bill at 12:15 while they set up the feature at 12:30 ... So I responded back kindly.

​

Hello $manager,

​

I have seen that you have set up the feature, but the feature needs to be set up before you start using it. Unfortunately since you already created the bill and sent it to your tax ministry you will need to send  cancellation to your tax ministry for this bill and then use the feature.

​

Regards $me

22,"""It's not everyday that I get customers as interesting as you.""","LTL;FTP

Today I'll be telling you a small story. I must preface it by assuring everyone that it takes place in Mexico, and thus there's no such thing as HIPAA. 

There's a small cast, as follows:
My friend, nameless here.
Her dad, happens to be a medical doctor.
Her brother, services medical machines.
A random attendant, she operates a small internet near the hospital.
Me, a decidedly non-IT guy known for figuring out ways to make everything work out alright.

A couple weeks ago, my friend crashed sometime near midnight and was admitted, unconscious and by ambulance, to the states primary hospital. She did not have insurance, and, in fact, getting anyone to know required the cop who responded to the crash to post her ID all over Facebook with hopes that someone would recognize her. I did and was the first to arrive on scene, just after informing her parents. 

So, scene set, it's the next day and she seems stable, but given the lack of insurance, her tests, specifically a tomography, could not be released to her parents, and it being a state operated hospital, visitation rights were scarce. However, her brother happens to work maintenance on medical machines, so he managed to get a CD with her tests to show their dad and decide on their course of action. Of course, the dad won't be leaving the hospital, so I volunteer to go to the internet a block over and try to convert the proprietary software images into something that can be shared by whatsapp and/or viewed on a phone. 

So I enter the place and am met with three very basic desktops, I ask the attendant which one has a CD drive and she tells me it's the first one, but that it's ""broken"". I try to ask around, figure out what's wrong with it, but she can only say it won't stay on. So I figure I need that one to work, and she can use it better if it does, so I offer that if I fix it she can let me use it for free, and she happily accepts.

Turn it on, it seems alright at first, but when I start typing on the old, clunky keyboard, weird things happen. It then hits me, and I press an arrow while on the desktop, and the screen freezes and turns. I try the ages old method of pressing every single modifier key a couple times, then start typing again. Lo and behold, problem's fixed. So I call her over, show her which keys to press and get loose whenever the problem starts again, and I'm on my way to get those images.

I do the needfull and finally have the pictures as I need them. Then comes the big problem. I can't connect my phone to the PC cause there is no cable, no bluetooth, and the attendant sadly doesn't know the WiFi password, as the WPS is supposed to work (it doesn't). So I try to upload it to my dropbox and the rate is abyssmal: nearly an hour to upload about 1 minute of content (I converted each set to a small 20 fps video, total 6 sets). I'm looking at the screen, wondering what to do, when the light bulb turns on. I ask her: ""Do you want the WiFi password?"" She says the owner doesn't know it, so I tell her, that I'll exchange it to her for a bag of chips (sold there). She says to go for it. 

Now, some of you may know of the wonderful tool known as wirelesskeyview, and as I'd noticed the computers happened to be connected over WiFi and not cable, well, I quickly ran it and jotted down the password, connected my phone, shared the files over FTP, and promptly gave her the paper and told her to try it. She connected her phone, looked at me and said ""it's not everyday that I get customers as interesting as you.""

And this, my dear readers, is the tale of how I got myself a free bag of Ruffles and an awesome ego boost while fixing a random estabilishment's PC.",False,404,33,LectorV,talesfromtechsupport
23,"""I refuse to work with you or do anything you say, but you're a terrible support team.""","Brief context. I'm tech support for a POS software. We serve several clients in different parts of the US, and basic 8-5pm support is included in everybody's contract. You also get 24/7 support if you decide later if you want to be added to that, which means you'll get assistance from whoever's on call for after hours.

One of the businesses we support ($TourGroup) is led by a rather strange, perpetually displeased young woman that we'll call $Cersei.

$TourGroup used to be led by a slightly older lady who, while not the most tech savvy, was always polite and kind when dealing with us to fix her stuff. We never had very many problems with her personally - our only issue with $TourGroup was the fact that NONE of their employees seemed to be able to follow basic instructions or remember basic processes. Most of their calls were helping them with quick annoying stuff, but they were usually very appreciative.

When the other lady stepped down and $Cersei became the head of the business....things changed. Here's a few things to keep in mind:

* $Cersei does not and has never liked working with our support team. We haven't been able to figure out why. She will put in tickets about ""critical"" issues, but then never follow up on them even when responded to. She regularly dips out of scheduled calls to remote in. She reschedules several times and often doesn't show up for the remote session. She will put in tickets, then immediately email our manager before anyone has even seen the ticket yet to complain that we're taking too long to resolve her issue. She gets angry when we suggest any kind of troubleshooting step. Basically, if it involves working with us to any extent, she quickly gets upset and tries to escalate. 
* $Cersei relies on her in-house IT team for EVERYTHING. Remember what I said above about her not wanting to talk to the support team? Yep - if she has to troubleshoot ANYTHING or provide more information other than ""it's broken"", she assigns one of her in-house IT who barely know the software to the ticket and orders us to work together while she goes off to do god knows what. It's frustrating for her IT people because she gives them just about as much info as she gives us. Also, none of them are very familiar with what the software is supposed to do or shouldn't be doing, so the blind is frequently leading the blind.
* $Cersei has also been known to just plop one of her other employees on the phone with us when she decides she doesn't want to speak with us. Said employee often has only a very vague idea of what's going on. Blind leading the blind, once more.
* $Cersei likes escalating. I think she gets high off of it. 

On to the story. This story in particular is what essentially brought my manager to the decision of looking a bit more critically at their contract.

Last year, $TourGroup had been having a lot of issues with being able to perform refunds in the POS software. Which is a valid concern.

$Cersei put in a ticket titled ""Unable to swipe cards"" Explaining that they were having issues swiping credit cards and to please call as it is a huge inconvenience. 

Actually, she never did put in an actual ticket. She **emailed our manager directly** a few days prior and our manager made a ticket for her. She has been told repeatedly that this is not the best way to get support. 

I took the ticket. Asked some follow up questions, mainly questions about how to reproduce the issue, if it was happening for all computers, if there was an error, what kind of swipers they were using, ect. I also reached out by phone, but only got her voicemail. $Cersei, of course, wasn't happy.

&gt;$Cersei: I don't have time for all of this, please just give us a call so we can get this resolved ASAP. This is affecting our business. 

So, I try again to call, but it just went to voicemail. Noted this in the ticket and asked $Cersei if she possibly had a better number where I could reach her. She doesn't reply...for three or four days, even with repeated attempts to contact her. Along with the troubleshooting questions I needed to so much as guess at what might be going on.

Ticket closed for inactivity after four days, per protocol. End of story, right?

Nope. She emails back on the ticket - with her IT people suddenly CC'ed on the email chain.

&gt;$Cersei: When the card is sitting there normally, it shows a green light. When we swipe a card, the light goes out and doesn't show the information in the screen. We replaced it with a new one, but we're still getting the same issue. I think the swipers are black but ordered from you guys.

(Just as a side note, we don't support, manufacture, or sell the swipers. But we DO tell people which swipers to order when they first sign on with us based on what payment processor they're using. The swipers they ordered didn't come from us - they would have been ordered by $TourGroup. In this case, we're trained to send them to the manufacturer first.)

But it finally looks like we're getting somewhere. I cheerfully reply. 

&gt;$Drej: Hi, $Cersei! Thanks for following up. We unfortunately do not support or manufacture credit card swipers - those would have been ordered by $TourGroup and are supported by $Manufacturer. It looks like this is an issue related to the swiper hardware itself rather than $Software. I'd contact them first to troubleshoot. \*gives contact info\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$Cersei: The machines are not swiping. I would like to set up a call with $SoftwareCompany and $TourGroupIT to get this sorted TODAY.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Drej: I am unfortunately not going to be available for a call today, but I'd be happy to schedule a call with you tomorrow at X time. Could you or your IT provide the following information? -insert troubleshooting/necessary info here-

$TourGroupIT replies with the answers to my questions. So far so good. I email $Cersei again to see if she was able to confirm a date for a call the next day.

&gt;$Cersei: This has gone on for too long. Get me the contact information for your supervisor.

Long story short, the ticket is escalated, our manager basically tells $Cersei (gently) why we ask the troubleshooting questions that we do, why we're trying to schedule a call to resolve the issue, ect. Cersei is of course kind and polite to our manager, if whiny as she complains that we ""take too long"" to resolve her issues. Her entire reply to our manager is this screechy rant about she's had nothing but problems with our software and how our support is ""terrible and slow"" and she doesn't feel like her problems are getting handled quickly enough.

The issue was resolved, though - someone had messed up the swiper configuration. Of course, even determining what exactly the issue was required us to spend over two hours on the phone with her IT because again, Queen $Cersei can't be arsed to be on a call to tell us what the software isn't doing that it should, or what it's doing that it shouldn't.

$Cersei also still emails our manager directly for most things. She's also currently on our lowest, trashiest, break-iest version of the software because she refuses to upgrade because ""our upgrades break everything"". 

TL;DR: User thinks our support team is awful and that we're slow, even though she's unwilling to communicate or work with us and gets frustrated easily when encouraged to troubleshoot. ",False,1203,121,QuantumDrej,talesfromtechsupport

25,The Great DHCP Catastrophe of 2018,"I'm an IT in the military and this particular issue takes place while out to sea. We had been having some issues tracking down assets that people had been moving around the ship. So someone would walk into a room, see a computer and decide that it would look better in their work space. This is obviously a hassle, because we have to keep very strict documentation of where things are installed throughout the ship. While out to sea we work 12 hour shifts of basically Help Desk. Answer a phone and ask ""Have you tired turning it off and on again?"". Repeat. 


I get up one morning and feel incredibly not ready for the day. Once in my shop, one of my fellow IT's comes up to me and begins explaining that he found a better way of finding these moved computers. Most of what he says kind of goes in one ear and out the other. I sit my desk and get start going through my emails. 


The phone rings suddenly and I mentally prepare myself for whatever it could be. 

&gt; $Kraken: IT2 Kraken speaking, how may I help you Sir, Ma'am, or Chief?

&gt; $User: For some reason the computer in my space won't let me log on.

Now I could walk them through describing the problem to me, but because I'm such a small ship I could just walk over there in that time. I arrive on the scene and immediately I realize the issue. 

*The log on server could not be reached*

Cool. I crawl under the desk and see that the Ethernet cable is still plugged in. Hmm, alright lets check out some other stuff. I boot into the BIOS and check to see if the computer sees a connection. And it does... Great. I log on to the machine with my admin rights and see that the computer has no IP. Weird. The adaptor settings are for DHCP. Maybe there is an issue there? I try to explain to the user that the next steps for me fixing it have to be done in my shop and that I would be right back. 


Once back in my shop, all hell has broken loose. Everyone is running around and scrambling to get **our** computers fixed. Turns out while I was troubleshooting that one machine, a large majority of computers on the network started showing the same symptoms. I suggest assigning a static IP on a test computer to see if that fixes the issue. Sure enough the computer jumps back on the domain no problem... I immediately use the computer to remote into my DHCP server and start digging through event viewer and logs. There is nothing to suggest that there is an issue here. I start going through updates and looking up KB to see if one of these updates broke my server. I spent the next 6 hours trying everything. In the meantime we have to go to each computer that is having an issue and assigning a static IP. 

The next day, we release an email to everyone saying that computers are dropping off the network likes flies, and if you have an issue call the IT's so can document and fix the issue. We pass an announcement over the 1MC (Like a PA system for the ship) describing the symptoms and to call us if you have issues. I'm researching like crazy, googling everything I can think of to find an answer. Around Hour 5 of Day 2 I call the Navy's Tech Support for Tech Support. The guy I'm talking to is trying to walk me through the basic troubleshooting steps I've already taken, I don't blame him. While we talk on the phone, I'm still digging through DHCP. And then I find it. There, in the filters I see MAC Address Whitelist and Blacklist... Someone had blacklisted two of the computers we had been trying to find... But they had also enabled whitelisting... And not put a single address in the list. I was shocked. Who did this? 


I inform the Tech Supports Tech Support that we can close the ticket and I had fixed the issue. I hang up and sit there for a second. What had that guy told me yesterday? I wait until the evening shift gets up to relieve us, and I ask him.


&gt; $IT1: Oh yeah, I blocked those two computers so whenever someone tries to log on, they would have to call us.

&gt; $Kraken: Did you... block it in DHCP?

&gt; $IT1: Yeah, Why?.... Oh...

&gt; $Kraken: Yeah.


I explain what he did wrong and we fixed the issue. However, we now had to go back to every computer and set them back to pull IP's automatically... At least we found those two computers...



TLDR; A fellow IT created a whitelist filter on DHCP without listing any MAC address. Killed whole network.

26,On doing personal favors,"Inspired by [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9apna1/when_employees_ask_for_help_with_their_personal/) over at /r/sysadmin, I thought I'd share my one and only experience doing private tech support at work.

So, here comes.

A member of the board of a company I worked at had a little whoopsie involving a personal USB drive with familiy photos on it. Basically, he accidentally formatted it - don't ask me how.

So, his secretary called me one day, and asked whether I would take a request for a personal favor from her boss - which is not something you don't at least listen to, coming from a board member of a rather large company. Long story short, it was an easy thing - Recuva brought back all 800GB of his familiy photos. Stuff like photos from their son's first communion, old scanned documents from their ancestors, lots of family photos - basically, scans of their whole family history spanning over 100 years.

How do I know what that data was? After the recovery, the (quite teary-eyed, I have to say) senior executive invited me for coffee in his office. He gave me a box of very, very good and also very, very expensive Spanish red wine, together with a nice thank-you-card signed by him and his wife, and told me that the disk was the only copy of those photos that still existed in their family after their house burned down a few months earlier.

&gt; $Me : Do you get an error message, or what happens when you try?  
&gt; $U : the password field just gets emptied  
&gt; $Me : OK, that's weird. I don't know $Random_app well, mind if I remote control your PC and have a look?  
&gt; $U : sure, no problem.  

So I remote in and see the $random_app's login screen opened in $U's browser.

$U starts typing her password and sure enough, at some point the password field on the log in form suddenly gets empty. I do notice however that the whole page has flickered once when that happened. Thus, I ask:

&gt;$Me : Did you insert a special character in your new password? Mind if I ask which one?  
&gt;$U : Yes, F5  
&gt;$Me : Huh, do you mean F5 as the function key?  
&gt;$U : Yes. It works without issue when I open my Windows session.

Cue me explaining to $U that F5 isn't a character but a function key, and while it does absolutely nothing on most program windows, it triggers a page refresh when in a web browser, which will usually empty all fields :)

I called him up and said, ""Hello, this is \_\_\_\_\_\_ from \*\*\*\* support. I'm calling in regards to case ####."" He tells me that his scanner isn't working and not taking the paper when he puts it in the tray. I also asked if he tried plugging the device into another system and he told me that plugging the device into another usb port won't work because he already tried it. I asked him again if he's using our software and even questioned whether or not he's using the WIA drivers because how else is he scanning? Our software works with the simplex and duplex button so...? He replies back that nothing works and it's faulty. I was a bit puzzled by his response because I ran through the process of ""giving him the answer to his issue and hanging up"" method of call center. So I remoted into the computer and he had Windows 10, right clicked on the windows icon and went to apps and features. I wanted to see if the software was there and it was, but when he would scan, it tells him that scanner isn't connected. I did notice that the scanner was there in both apps and device manager. I ran the removal tools for our software and it still didn't work. I finally went to modify his scanner download in apps and features, only to be greeted with a quick poof of the driver as soon as I clicked on it. He never had the driver downloaded after all.   
 So I had to download the driver from the website. He was already getting angry because nothing was working and I told him that I'm trying the best I can and I want to complete the process without any draw backs. He begins to tell me that I'm a horrible technician and how I shouldn't be taking this long. Keep in mind that this guy is an IT person as well. I ended up telling him that we can RMA the scanner because we do keep running into the same issue that he's getting. I asked him if he had a warranty and he went on this rant about how the system we use to find the warranty is messed up and it's my fault for making it this messed up. At that point I didn't say anything, but the simple line - \*5 second pause\* ""let me transfer you to the customer service department so I can file an RMA for you. Let me finish up my notes and I'll transfer you, sir.""  He was asking me if he needed a receipt or the warranty expired a year after the purchase date.

32,"Two salesmen blew me off, twice, on custom programming","I've had a couple salesmen ask me for custom programming, which is part of my job. No problem, since I want the company as a whole to save time doing things and have usable information that help them make decisions quickly. They want a certain report for only one of their customers, so we meet, I do the programming, send them a test report, and never hear from them again. After all that time I put into it the project is dead.

So now when they ask me to do custom programming for a sales person, I ask them to give me screen shots of every screen in the software that runs our company, that shows the data they want. This helps me find where the data is in the database (the table and field), and makes them commit some of their time into it before I commit my time. I want to know if they are serious or not about this. 

Also, during busy times, any sales projects go to the very bottom of the pile to be done last. What this means is it could be 2-3 months before I even touch their project or look at it. I think they received my message loud and clear. 

Now, only salesmen who are reliable and will actually use their custom report call me. Problem solved!

33,Catching the toner thiefs,"I'm based offshore on an oil platform and printer toner is locked in a cupboard, the reason we don't let regular users replace the toner is that they somehow always manage to fuck it up each time and an engineer can take weeks if its really broken, plus we need to make note of our stock levels as they never tell us when one is used and it takes days for new toner to arrive via boat.

Well of course the nighshift would grab the key to the cupboard when I wasnt there and I'd only realise when I went in to get a toner cartridge and see that we're low. I put a notice up saying 'if you take any toner please inform IT so we can update our stock sheet' but nope that didn't work, toner still going missing, wake up to notes on my desk saying the printers are fucked etc. 

To catch them I created a fake sign out form and stuck it on a clipboard in the stock cupboard with a pen, it asked people to write their name, date/time and what toner was taken, basically they were signing their own confession that they were taking toner and also coincided with the printer logs when the printer fucked up. The list was passed to the manager and I didn't have any problems after that.",False,1391,120,DarkangelUK,talesfromtechsupport
34,The Mystery of the Recurring Startup Errors,"Cast:

**$hyacinth** \- Me

**$user**\- A new-ish employee

​

This takes place during my consulting days. The client company in this case was notoriously stingy- they didn't like spending money on anything. But, they hired a new employee and that meant they had to buy him a brand new PC. I set it up and everyone was happy for a few months. Then one morning $user flagged me down...

​

&gt;**$user:** Hey, $hyacinth! I'm getting this weird error every time I turn my computer on.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$hyacinth**: Ok, let me take a look at it.

​

It's a dll error (this was a Windows 7 PC, if I remember correctly). Odd to have startup dll errors on a brand new machine, but things happen. I ran the startup repair utility while $user took his lunch and the error was, seemingly, resolved. Two months later:

​

&gt;**$user**: $Hyacinth, that error is back. Every time I turn on my computer I get that same error message as last time!  
&gt;  
&gt;**$hyacinth**: Hm, that's not good. You shouldn't be getting startup errors- your PC is new. I'll run the repair utility again, but if it keeps happening I may need to reinstall the OS.

​

I ran the startup repair again, and again the error was apparently fixed. ""What the hell is causing these errors?"", I thought. ""I'd really rather not have to rebuild this PC since the company will definitely not want to approve the billable hours for the work"". I hoped against hope that the dll error wouldn't come back. Alas, about a month later...

​

&gt;**$user**: (walks over to me) The error is back!  
&gt;  
&gt;**$hyacinth**: /sigh.

​

""Maybe it's not the same error,"" I thought as I followed $user back to his desk. I asked him to show me the error, but he'd already dismissed it.

​

&gt;**$hyacinth**: I want to make sure that it's the same error before I commit to reinstalling your OS. Can you please reboot so I can see the error message when the PC comes back up?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$user**: Sure.

​

And then $user did something...unexpected. Strange. He started to reach under his desk, towards the PC tower. ""Why is he doing that?"" I thought. $user extended his first finger, aiming at the power button. I suddenly realized his goal.

​

&gt;**$hyacinth**: Wait! Whoa whoa whoa! You don't need to force the computer off. It's still responsive. I just need you to reboot it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$user**: \*deer in headlights look\* ... \*reaches towards power button again\*  
&gt;  
&gt;**$hyacinth**: No no no! Don't hit the power button. Just reboot it the normal way.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$user**: \*looks at power button, then looks at me\* Pushing the power button isn't how you turn the computer off?

&amp;#x200B;

A heavenly choir sang as the source of $user's startup errors became clear. He had been force powering off his computer EVERY NIGHT for months.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**$hyacinth**: No, $user. I'll show you how to do it the usual way. Go to the little Windows icon in the bottom left corner....

&amp;#x200B;

I showed him how to shut down his computer properly. He had no further complaints of startup issues for the remainder of my time working for that company.

35,The expensive mess up for the most expensive computer,"A recent post reminded me of this issue from a few years ago.  I think 2015.

This one client from the construction stories I have posted about before went all out on this beast of a computer for the most expensive version of AutoCAD you can get.  I think the computer was like $17,000.  Among his regular work, this guy was also creating AutoCAD drawings for the CEO's house to remodel.

One day, the computer crashed and the OS had to be reinstalled. 
 Now, we had backups for every computer (when it worked, but that's another story) but only for the user profile.  This guy saved the CEO's drawings to a folder in the root, something like C:\Projects.  

Additionally, he had 2 large SSDs as the primary, but were I think RAID0, essentially making it like 1 bad hard drive, instead of RAID1, for backup (if I got the RAID numbers mixed up, let me know and I'll correct it).

In the end we had to ship off the hard drives to a data recovery service (not sure how much they saved), an email went out making sure everyone knew to *only* save to their user profile, but we all changed the backup settings to include this guy's entire C: drive.",False,216,65,lesethx,talesfromtechsupport
36,How I learn to refuse tickets,"This is still something I  am ashamed by.

​

We got a new contract to manage a clients servers. A part in datacenters, nice and clean and a part still in his offices, old, never patched or maintained.

One of the big issue was storage. Datastore were getting full (&gt;90%) and data were never archived.

Main culprits being the multiple file servers.

After weeks of waiting a decision client side and a lot of email going back and forth, they decide to get a drive deleted.

They open a ticket with the request

&gt;Please delete drive K

​

Note the absence of server name. I even mentally joked that I would delete the K drive on a random server.

This is where I was stupid, did not requested clarification and based myself on the exchange of emails.

So I went on $Filer1, unmounted the drive, set an alarm for final deletion a month later and a month later deleted the drive from the datastore.

​

2 weeks after the deletion a user could not found its data, left on the server $Filer1.

A small investigation revealed I had deleted the wrong drive.

The email exchange concerned multiple servers and I had swapped 2 names.

​

Accident happens and stuff like that is easy to fix, it's only a date restoration.

Remember how I said storage was an issue ?

The previous team had worked around the issue by removing servers from the backup jobs to save space (on a side note, the backup job was set up in a way that even the servers in the backup job didn't backup).

​

Client is not happy, but since they wrote the dodgy ticket and did not manage their backup properly, they let go of the issue.

​

TL;DR : I accept an ambiguous change leading to the deletion of user data. Backup being a luxury, the data are lost forever.

​

Today, when I get an ambiguois change with risks, I think of that story and refuse the change.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit : I'm happy to see you enjoy my shame \^\^, but I need to clarify some elements.

I'm aware I fucked up. Even if I was green at the time, I should have known better.

It was a few years ago, I'm wiser now and would probably not do it again.

The ticket was written by the client's IT team and they were the ones exchanging the emails, we were not in contact with non technical people.

And because the idea was to free some space on the datastores, I deleted the vmdk. We did tried to recover data but did not manage to.

The client was really nice and they accepted they were also at fault since they did not manage their backup well.",False,927,61,vondrakenstorm,talesfromtechsupport
37,"Willful Ignorance, and How It Wins in the End","So the company I work for was bought out by another company. So we have two separate usernames we have to keep track of while our all our applications migrate from one system to the other. Company 1(C1) will be the main company that bought out my company, which I'll call Company 2(C2).

So I get this middle aged plus guy on the phone who is supposed to be the head of security for an entire building somewhere in Arizona and he tells me he's having trouble logging into one of C2's applications. His tone of voice throughout the call gives off the impression that he's in this perpetual state of confusion and just overwhelmed by everything. He starts up a long, slow rant about being computer illiterate and how this migration has ""ruined everything"" and made everything so hard; meanwhile I tune him out and check out his account in active directory and find it's locked. I go through the whole spiel for unlocking it and tell him to try again as soon as I reach a pause in his rant. Problem solved, right?

Nope. He still can't log in. I verified that he was in fact using C2's username and that it wasn't working, and he confirmed he was. Alright, time to assume user error.

&gt;**Me:** Okay, so describe to me what the sign in screen looks like.

&gt;**Him:** It's the internet log in. I can't log into the internet.

&gt;**Me:** I thought you were having trouble logging into the C2 application...?

&gt;**Him:** Well yeah, because I can't log into the internet.

I sighed out loud on mute. It's a tortured, drawn out sound. You know the one.

If you don't know, with anyone middle-aged and older the word ""internet"" can mean numerous things. It could mean he can't connect to the WiFi, it could mean the VPN, or it could mean any one of the numerous web applications that require login, most notably C1's home page that recently supplanted the one used by C2. I guess I should at least count myself lucky he didn't just use the word, ""computer"" for everything.

I took a guess.

&gt;**Me:** Okay, so does it say C1 Network Login on the page?

&gt;**Him:** Yeah, I think so...

&gt;**Me:** Okay, you're on the C1 home page, you actually want to use C1UserID here to log in.

&gt;**Him:** Oh. So C1UserID is the password.

I winced as if struck. He literally thought the *word* C1UserID was the password, rather than his actual C1UserID which would have been a combo of his last name and first and middle initials. It took a minute or two to walk him through what I meant. I remind you this guy proclaimed himself head of security for an entire goddamn facility. 

He grumbled about how that was confusing and didn't make sense, but managed to log into the C1 homepage managing to put the C1UserID in the UserID field.. He had no problem getting to the C2 application from there, and so I had him try logging in again. What do you know, he still can't. Account still unlocked. No invalid password attempts recorded.

&gt;**Me:** Okay, I want to verify something here. What UserID are you using.

&gt;**Him:** C1UserID.

&gt;**Me:** No. You want to actually be using C2UserID.

He started making this strangled noise and seemed to stumble on his thoughts before choking out something resembling a sentence.

&gt;**Him:** But you just told me to use C1UserID.

&gt;**Me:** For the home page, because that's a C1 website. C2 Application is still with C2, so it still uses C2UserID.

&gt;**Him**: I'm confused. There are so many usernames now, I can't keep it straight. This doesn't make sense. It's—

I cut him off before he spiral any further, I was starting to get frustrated.

&gt;**Me:** There are two. *Two* UserIDs. One for Company 1, one for Company 2. C1UserID is used for programs that have moved to the C1 side of the system. This application is still on the C2 side of the system though, so it still uses C2UserID. The one you use for your computer login?

He seemed to get what I was saying, and managed to type it out. Still no dice. I quizzed him a bit and figured out he was using Chrome. I had him switch to IE—for some reason most of our applications are still IE-only—expecting him to not know the difference between them. But surprisingly he had no problem switching them and getting back to the same log in screen.

We got the same results there though, so I became suspicious. I was almost certain the issue was user error of some sort at this point, since there were no incorrect password hits in AD. I figured now was the time I try and remote in. Unfortunately, for some reason, his computer name wasn't recorded anywhere, so I'd have to get it from him directly. My company never had the foresight to just slap a label on the workstation, so I'd have to rely on the user's ability to do basic things like locate the start menu and more advanced skills like locating and utilizing a search bar. 

&gt;**Me:** Okay, I need your computer name. Do you know how to find that?

&gt;**Him:** No, I don't.

&gt;**Me:** Okay. Go to the start menu.

He made that strangled sound again and I began to longingly envision myself becoming the cause of that. Oh I do so pine after the far-off days of technology capable of enabling manual strangulation through a phone receiver.

&gt;**Him:** ...wh-what's that?

Head of security. Entire facility.

&gt;**Me:** (through a thin, false veneer of cheer) It's the button in the bottom left of your screen? With the windows symbol?

He made the noise again, mixing it up this time with a few confused oh, ah, and ums as I pictured him squinting, mouth agape, inches from the screen. Unfortunately I didn't know whether he was running Windows 7 or 10—and I doubted asking him would produce anything coherent— so I tried my best to vaguely help him locate it.

&gt;**Me:** Okay. So do you see the time, in the bottom right?

&gt;**Him:** ...yes...

&gt;**Me:** Okay. It's part of a grey, maybe black, bar that goes along the bottom. It has all your icons on it? 

&gt;**Him:** ...yes...

&gt;**Me:** And on the far, left side of that bar from the time should be the start menu. With a Windows logo? The icon looks like a flag or a curvy window? 

His only response was respond in the negative and continue making confused, flustered noises. The internal scream that sounded throughout the depths of my mind was composed of frustration and anguish too potent for words to ever imprison in any form of prose. It was time for a new approach.

&gt;**Me:** Nevermind, we'll find it a different way. On your keyboard. You see in the bottom row? The one with the flag symbol? The only one with a symbol instead of words.

&gt;**Him:** I...I think...so...?

&gt;**Me:** Press it. Did that open the start menu?

&gt;**Him:** I...I don't know...? On my screen...it just...Control panel...? Network...? Computer...? I don't...so confusing...not computer savy...

More flustered noises. But hey, I figured out we're working with Windows 7, so that's something, right? It has to be. Windows 10 would never make Control Panel or your mapped drives that intuitive and easy to locate.

&gt;**Me:** Yes. That thing that just opened. That's the start menu. Do you see the search bar at the bottom of it?

&gt;**Him:** I don't...I don't know...I don't see it... This is impossible. Can you just escalate this to someone? I can't figure it out. It's too hard.

Honestly, I wasn't supposed to do that. I was supposed to persevere, carry on. Run through all the troubleshooting. If I could just get the computer name I could almost remove him from the equation entirely. That's what I'd normally do. I gave objection under those pretenses, but it was halfhearted. This call—it had changed me.

I'd come in to battle bright-eyed and unsoiled, flanked with a fully-equipped squad. Optimism. Patience. Sanity. Resolve. One by one each of them had been picked off to die and bleed out in my arms under a hail of willfully enforced ignorance. Until all that was left was just me and my lack of shits to give.

When he protested again, equally half-heartedly, I flew the white flag of defeat.

&gt;**Me:** (through a veneer of actual, *relieved* cheer) I can absolutely do that. Let me just send this off to the department that manages access to that app, I'm 100% sure it's on their end and has nothing to do with any error on your part at all. Don't sweat it. You have a great day.

I work in a somewhat unique situation in that I am on a team that manages the *product*, which being cloud-based, includes some network and system admins. In the same building, there is a Helpdesk team which manages the *office* which sells and supports the product. Making that separation even less clear, some of the more experienced Helpdesk employees have transitioned to the networks team over the years. In short, we have a problem with Helpdesk trying to enlist our help with issues outside our scope, or even dumping them in our laps disguised as ""asking for help"". We are a bit wary at this point any time a Helpdesk employee wanders into our area.

This afternoon, we finally got a replacement printer in our shared suite. This was generally considered a Good Thing as the old printer only would only manage to deliver a single page before going offline, and the next closest printer was three badge readers away.

Yesterday, after silencing the bagpipe sound that is my alarm and still slightly bleary eyed, I see an email from my boss. He's asking me to go check up on a user that is reporting missing files that are (actually) mission critical. Being still half asleep I start thinking worst case scenario. These particular clients don't take advantage of the backup service we offer and rely on saving things in the cloud. If these files are missing, then the client is going to be SOL and there wouldn't be anything I can do to fix it.

I make a point of always clarifying with users exactly what their issue is. An email might say: *""Help, none of my office apps are working""*, but they mean *""Help, Outlook isn't syncing between my devices""*. This was no exception.

I call up the user and he tells me that $FileSyncSoftware on his desktop PC is showing the files, but they are missing on his laptop.

""*This is good news*"" I think to myself. The files exist in at least one place at the moment. The client says that he has to leave the office, but he'll leave the desktop and laptop on for me and have the file explorer windows open to show me what's missing. After getting the specifics on what files and folders seems to be missing, I tell him that I'm on my way and head out the door.

This may be a complaint post...maybe? I've spent all week doing support on it so I think it counts. If it doesn't please remove it.

April of this year we finally migrated to a new cloud based VoIP provider for our phones. Migration went smoothly, adoption rate was amazing, everyone was happy. Everyone except **RC**- which is kind of a big deal as that's literally **RC**'s job, to answer the phone and manage incoming calls. There have been several complaints over the last few months, all revolving around the fact that **RC** doesn't know how to page out, transfer calls, or answer multiple lines. **RC** could do all this on the old system, but of course with new systems comes new processes, which requires - god forbid they hear me say it - learning new things! I spent the entire first week with this new system working with **RC** to make sure they were comfortable with it.

It all sort of came to a head during this week, with the explosion occurring this morning, like 3 hours ago.

To keep it short(ish), in order for **RC** to send a page out to everyone's desk phones, there can't be an active line on **RC**'s phone. If **RC** wants to page out while someone is on hold, **RC** would need to park the call and then send the page. I went over the call parking process, it's a total of ***3***  button presses, but that's apparently way too many so another solution had to be found. There is a wireless handset **RC** can take if they leave the main desk, that wireless handset has the ability to page.

Cool, awesome, just use that to page while someone is on hold on the main phone, badda bing badda boom we're done here. Call paging has a total of...wait for it...***2*** button presses to complete the page. Below is the conversation from this morning.

paging so I found a quick and easy way to do it. If you have someone on hold on the main line and want to do a page, just pick up the mobile phone, press this button, then this one, speak, then hang up. Quick and easy right?

&gt;**RC** :: But on the old system I could do it all from the main phone

&gt;**SA** :: I know, but with this new system we have to do it a little different. In fact it's even less buttons to press with the new one, isn't that awesome?

&gt;**RC** :: No, that's completely unacceptable. I want to do it the way I did on the old system.

&gt;**SA** :: I understand and I hear you, but unfortunately with this new system, there's a new way to do things. The old way won't work on the new system

&gt;**RC** :: That's not right. I know for a fact I've done it the old way on this new system, it just stopped working this week

&gt;**SA** :: Ok....I can see why that would be frustrating. Let me find out if there have been any updates or feature changes that would have caused this.

___

Quick chat with support revealed no, no feature changes, no updates. It's literally impossible to page out the way **RC** wants to do it. No way has **RC** done it that way on the new system. Back to the story.

___

&gt;**SA** :: So I called support just to see if there was a way we can make this work for you, they said it's impossible to page out the way you want to, that it's not an option and never has been. Maybe you're mis-remembering? We did just get this system recently, maybe you're thinking of the old one?

&gt;**RC** :: No, I know I've done the paging that way before on this system.

&gt;**SA** :: Ok....but it can't be done that way, so that's not possible. You couldn't have done it that way

&gt;**RC** :: Ok so now you're telling me what I have or haven't done in the past. Thanks, I really appreciate it. This is ridiculous and completely unacceptable. I want to do it the way I always have before. If I can't do it that way then we need to get a new phone system, this one doesn't work.

___

Ok, ya sure, let me breach contract, cancel our service, and replace hundreds of phones- all because one feature for one person has to be completed a different way from the old way. I'll get right on that.

___

&gt;**SA** :: We aren't going to get a new phone system, that's not an option. I know you're upset but this is the way you'll have to do it if you want to page out while you have a call on hold.

&gt;**RC** :: This is unacceptable ***(there's that word again...)***. I'm putting in a complaint with leadership, this phone system is terrible and we need a new one.

&gt;**SA** :: If you feel the need to do that, go ahead. But that's not going to change the way the system operates, it's not going to change the process you have to follow to page out. Here are the instructions, I printed them out for you. Let me know if it doesn't work. If you try to do it the old way, it won't work, and I don't want to hear about it. Have a good day.

44,Our System Is Always Updating And We Can't Run Reports... Ok Ok Ok You Can look at the code... This is fast!,"Our Finance team had a user just technically savvy enough to run their business intelligence (BI) tool. They went outside of IT and purchased this so we had minimal involvement because they knew what they were doing and besides this has sensitive data...

So time passes and we start getting complaints about our iSeries being too slow. Our particular system is a beast and pretty much outruns anything we've put up against it. So since it involves SQL I get asked to help.

So I go back and forth with the Finance 'tech' person and finally convince him to send me his SQL script.

The basic deal is they want to run this every two hours so they can have near real time data. Unfortunately at this time his script is taking... you guessed it, two hours...

The back-end for their BI product is SQL Server. So his script is basically pulling data from the iSeries (DB2) through a database connection directly into SQL Server tables.

I examine his script to see what it is doing. Basically he is hitting one of the largest tables in the database thirteen times, once for each financial period, and pulling raw data down and then the part that is losing time he is then consolidating all of this data from tens of millions of rows down to thousands of rows using grouping by and sums.

Compared to the iSeries (think Formula 1 Ferrari) his SQL Server is a go-cart with a Briggs and Stratten 5 hp engine.

I call and ask him if he needs any of this detail data and he only needs the summary. Bingo.

I rewrite all of his script to use a pass through query, which is basically SQL Server asking the other system to do all the work, and do all of the summation on the iSeries side and give him the results. As I said the iSeries is a beast and does the summations without even breathing hard. SQL Server is happy as it is now getting the data much quicker.

Now the script runs in five minutes. At this point I look at the functional part and realize we could accomplish all of this even faster if we did one download into a table and created thirteen views. I showed this to our financial BI person and she just sighs. He designed the database around his spreadsheet. He has thirteen tabs on his spreadsheet, one for each period, hence the thirteen tables and thirteen calls to the database.

I call him and discuss this and now he gets very angry! He knows how to design a database thank you very much. So where am I on his query? It runs in five minutes (but with views we could get it down to under a minute). So I have to prove to him we are getting the same result and he finally concedes this is better. But he won't listen on creating views.

We end up closing the ticket at this point.

So the only real SQL magic is use the right tool at the right point to do the heavy lifting. iSeries rocks!",False,287,64,JustAnOldITGuy,talesfromtechsupport
45,The tale of the possessed PC...,"In this episode, we have the mysterious case of the possessed PC.

​

Once upon a time, I worked offshore for a surveying company. I got a rather frantic call regarding a PC that was ""possessed"". Intrigued, I headed downstairs to assess the situation. What I found when I got there was the cursor moving erratically around the screen. I figured some driver or other had gone haywire, and decided to reboot the offending PC. This turned out to be a bigger challenge that I expected. I ended up having to resort to keyboard shortcuts to shut the machine down. I forget whether this was a Windows 2000 machine or one running Windows XP. I got the machine restarted, and as soon as it booted up, the cursor began jumping all over the place again. It was moving icons hither and yon, opening and closing menus, and generally playing merry hell with the system. I thought perhaps the mouse had lost its tiny little mind, but disconnecting it did not resolve the issue. I decided to revert back to troubleshooting basics and unplugged EVERYTHING from the machine except power and the monitor. The cursor became quiescent. Eureka! I began to plug various cables in one by one until I discovered the source of the problem. Apparently, Windows sees GPS data as a mouse. I don't remember the fix to the problem, but we were eventually able to actually have GPS data input into the PC without having a cursor zooming across the screen.

​

Now, it should be fairly obvious that this issue was many years ago, and I had largely forgotten the incident... until a few weeks ago, when an officer reported that he was unable to control his computer because it was ""possessed"". The laptop functioned perfectly on my test bench, so we brought the offending laptop down to his cruiser to see if the demon was residing in his vehicle. As soon as he plugged everything into his laptop, the cursor immediately went to the top left corner of the screen and refused to budge. While it was in that corner, it would repeatedly open menus, dialogs, highlight things, etc. I unplugged the officer's GPS and all was well. This was a windows 10 PC and a USB GPS... In this case, making sure the GPS was not connected when the PC booted seemed to resolve the issue.

​

I am still working with the software vendor to be able to take in GPS data across the network so that we can eliminate the USB GPS.

47,It's plugged in and it's just not working!,"This is a really quick story, but it was so mind-bogglingly dumb I just have to share it.

I was out to one of my client's sites, a dentist/orthodontist's office, replacing an operatory PC. They run a couple programs that allow them to manage client history, check and run Xrays, etc. They use simple USB sensors and tend to swap them out often because they may use multiple sensors to take multiple readings, easy peasy, right?

The problem is, the USB ports were being destroyed by them swapping the sensors in and out so aggressively and so constantly that I decided to plug a usb Extender into the back of the PC and secure the female end to the Desk near the monitor. Win-Win, it's easier for them to swap sensors, I don't end up with broken I/O.

As I'm replacing this Operatory PC, a hygienist runs over to me.

&gt;Hyg: ""I think you messed with the server, I plugged in the sensor and it's not being recognized. I know you're working on [dental software] for the new computer, you must've broken something""

Now, credit to the software company, it's a legacy application and is not simple to troubleshoot or install, but the sensors are super simple and literally install their own drivers when they're plugged in. 


&gt;me: ""It just stopped working?""

&gt;Hyg: ""Yeah, it's plugged in and it's just not working!""

So I walk over to the operatory, where the USB extender is AS VISUALLY AND PHYSICALLY ACCESSIBLE AS MODERN PHYSICS ALLOWS. 

Nothing is plugged in. 

I stand there a bit quizzical, thinking I must be missing something obvious. I really try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this time was too much.
I plug in the sensor and, guess what, it works.

$PwP=Person with Problem

This issue happened when I worked for $BASDC- Big Arrogant Design Software Company (almost put out of business by another Big Design Company at this point) in phone tech support:

Phone rings:

$Dad: ""Let me put you on the phone with the $Person with the problem, hang on""

I proceed to troubleshoot $PwP's printing issue, but ... the time spent was really troubleshooting the person themselves, as it's clear they had some mental illness.

What was happening was that I'd do a step, and ask the result from the $PwP, and he's give me the result I was expecting from the previous step. Once I worked out that I would give a series of instructions and think about what the solution would be in an N -1 kinda way, the troubleshooting went OK.

As for the solution, I could not get $PwP to actually do that. ANYTHING that made him do N vs. N -1 would send him into a fit of horrific self-criticism.

I learned more about the faults of his personality asking him to just do one final single step than I know about my own wife. For TWO HOURS I knew what the problem was, but could not get him to implement the simple fix. Even when I tried to tell him to do another step first, he'd balk, since I'd already let it slip the final step would end the call.

Finally, I realized he was simply incapable of executing the actual step N, I tried to get him to put $Dad back on the phone, presenting him with another N vs N -1 problem. There was no second step. 30 minutes later, he finally agreed to do this.

Not by his own volition, however. FIRST, I asked him to add paper to the printer, then go get $Dad. When he came back on the phone to tell me he'd added paper, $Dad picked up!

I told $Dad what was going on and asked him to make the change- aka reboot the printer- and it would be fixed. And it did.

Turns out, that this was a monitored call, and my boss was listening in during that whole call. He came up to me afterward and said it was the best handling of perhaps the most troublesome customer he'd ever heard.

So anyway, I work at a college  help-desk. My job mainly consists of helping students and staff navigate the extensive and somewhat convoluted College system, more or less monitor the systems and alert admins when something is going wrong for students or in general (online school program is down, wifi out,etc) as well as maintain the library computers and make sure the 60k piece of crap printers don't jam more than twice a day.

A big one is emails. My college uses Gsuite, which is basically just fancy Gmail that the college makes students get when they register, and is the only email they'll send college related stuff to.

I get a call one day from a woman who sounds kinda panicked.

Me: Hello, how can I help you?

Lady: Hi, are the college emails private?

Me: what do you mean?

Lady: I mean I thought only the school could contact us through them, right? Just the school?

I know the email is basically just a gmail with some extra protections on it from the college, but otherwise works just like a normal email and tell her this.

Lady: are you sure? Because I haven't put it on any sites or anything and I just got an email from a woman claiming to be the daughter I gave up for adoption 40 years ago?!

Yo, *what*? This floored me. I couldn't actually advise her on what action to take, all I could tell her is if she hadn't posted it anywhere there was a very real possibility that it was her daughter. Emails also aren't listed anywhere outside of online classes where other students can see them, so it genuinely was a, ""holy shit"" moment. I ended up giving her my name and she said she'd, ""come in and update me on what happens"" because she was going to pursue it. I was honestly hoping she would actually come in, though I didn't expect it.

Lo and behold two days later she came to the desk and asked for me.

It was her daughter.

Through some question and answer stuff she figured out this lady was legitimately her daughter, and had managed to track her (the mother) down through a lot of extensive file digging and found her college email through this (apparently you can request emails). She was so excited and stunned because she'd hoped forever her kid would reach out but she never did, and she didn't even know where to start looking for her (she thought she'd moved as a kid, turned out she was in the same county of the same state the woman gave her up for adoption in).

Now she has a daughter, and a 19 year old granddaughter, and both of them are coming up to visit the mother in September.

She told me if I hadn't been able to help her eliminate the possibilities of it being a hack she might never have responded. It's very tech-support lite in a sense, and I don't really think I should be given that much credit, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the best experience I've ever had at my job.

57,"The one where the website is broken, but all other sites work - it isn’t on the server side, but that’s just so hard to explain!","So here’s one from tonight - My background 20+ years in web hosting and development. 

A bit long, but worth the read - and certainly highlights the importance of keeping network hardware updated. 

So I’ve got a legacy customer that I built two custom web based software platforms for a while back that run two of their companies (both basically warehouse order and inventory management platforms - but not relevant)

For the last few days they’ve been having pages not load correctly, data not showing up in the database properly, records blanking out in the database - just general weirdness.  In one of the systems the most recent file update was in 2012, So not a chance it was on our end and I was 99% sure — but the two sites they visit on my server were the only ones that seemed to have these issues.   That part I’m pretty sure is because of the type of data transfer happening with our sites, and the fact that they are  on those sites all day every day and probably wouldn’t even notice it if it happened somewhere else. 

I went up to their office tonight and spent 3 hours helping them go through their computers to find the issue. 

In the end, the router in their office was hacked and redirecting certain traffic to a JavaScript based crypto mining malware. 

It was insane. We had every computer in the office turned off, and only one connected to the internet - still having the same issue. 

I noticed something weird about the way the page on the tab was showing (it had only the address, and the address was in quotes) - so I did a view source and it showed a JavaScript wrapper with CoinHive in there, then a frame that loaded the original site address — this is why no post data was coming through on the one system, and why the customer info was blanked out on the second system (because it wasn’t actually handing the request properly, just taking the address and spitting it back in the iframe)

They had another computer in the corner that hadn’t been connected to the network in a few years.  

We made sure nothing else was on the network, and plugged that one in (to make sure it wasn’t a virus that had spread to all computers) - same problem. 

That narrowed it down to the modem, and 2 routers (one was just used as a wireless access point)

A quick google search for the MikroTik router and CoinHive showed that a significant number of those routers have been compromised and created a coin mining bot net. 

Ran to the store and grabbed a new router and had them back online with everything working!

---

There are a bunch of people involved in this story, but most of them are a faceless mass of innocent users who know so little about computers that they don't recognize the stupidity of the manager that was setting them up in the system. Let's collectively call them $InnocentUsers and their manager $Fool. 

There's also my $HelpfulBoss and mentor, and then, of course, me. 

&gt; $Fool: A lot of my $IUs are experiencing major slowdowns with $WebApplication. It's hurting our work!

$HB immediately leaps into action to start diagnosing the issue. A slowdown on our application means something is really wrong. See, we have five servers, four application servers and a load balancer, designed to distribute the work to avoid these slowdowns. If it's slowing down, then one or more servers is having issues. 

But a brainwave strikes $HB.

&gt; $HB: Hey, $Fool, what URL are you and the $IUs using?

&gt; $Fool: `&lt;ServerNumber&gt;.&lt;bank&gt;.com:&lt;portNumber&gt;\&lt;applicationNonsense&gt;`

Cue facepalm between me and $HB. They were using one of the development URLs that accessed one specific server, rather than the load balancer's url (wich was a short, pretty, and sensible url like acronym.bank.com). That meant that one poor application server was getting 4x the traffic and couldn't enlist the help of the other three. 

While he goes on to try to fix stupidity — and isn't that an impossible task — $HB then orders me to start looking through the log files to see if anything else is wrong. I doubt there is, but it can't hurt to check, right?

Wrong. 

I'm writing this from my phone, and my boss came up to me a minute ago before I could post. I set this aside and we had this exchange. 

&gt; $HB: why are you looking at raw log files? We've got this cool app that can help visualize them!

This is news to me. 

&gt; Me, internally: Fuck yes! Hallelujah!

&gt; Me, out loud: Great. 

&gt; My asshole computer: Hahahah! Nope. 

Earlier this morning, we were using my laptop to experiment with Java version compatibility. Our company laptops, being as locked down as they are, use a remote software portal to install new and approved software. I'd selected the new version of Java to install and let it do its thing behind the scenes. 

It failed. Spectacularly. Without notifying me. 

So when I go to install the log viewer application, it turns out it haf uninstalled Java entirely and failed to reinstall it. I'm currently waiting for it to try again, because after seening the sheer size of the log files (remember, 4x the expected user traffic and all the problems that causes), I do not want to deal with that garbage by hand. 

Anyway, wish me luck. I don't know if the software portal will fail again, but I hope not. ",False,146,25,wille179,talesfromtechsupport

I'm checking each plugin and seeing if its function is still necessary, when I come across one that had been written by my predecessor at the company, called ""CompanyName tag-based sidebar""  I ask my supervisor, $supe, who was also my predecessor's supervisor, what it does.

&gt;$me: Hey, do you know what this plugin does?

&gt;$supe: Oh, that was written for the old version of the site.  It's supposed to show related content in the sidebar. We don't need that anymore.

&gt;$me: Okay, thanks.

I dutifully remove the plugin.  A week or so later, the guy who manages the web store comes to me.

&gt;$storeGuy: Hi, there used to be a custom post type called advertisements, and it's gone now.  Do you know what happened to it?

&gt;$me: Nope, but I'll look into it.

So I check the site's code, and I see almost-identical code for a post type called ""promotions"".  I then assume that the code to create the advertisement post type had been in the same file, and that some clueless person had deleted it, because it looked like it was a duplicate.  I restore the advertisement post type.

Another week passes, and $storeGuy comes back to me.

&gt;$storeGuy: So the advertisements are appearing on Page X of the site like they're supposed to, but I just noticed that they're missing from the sidebars of page type Y.  Can you fix that too?

&gt;$me: I'll poke around.

I open the site in GiantNetArchive, and find a page with the relevant sidebar.  The ads are there, so I inspect them...and they all contain a data redirect through a plugin called ""tag-sidebar""  Oops.

I look at the code for the plugin (thankfully I saved the code before removing it) and discover that that plugin created the advertisement post type, as well as a sidebar widget to display said ads and track clicks and impressions.  So much for $supe's assurances that we didn't need it anymore.

I restore the plugin and re-add the widget to the sidebar, everything is fine and dandy, and $storeGuy thinks I'm a genius.

63,Tech Support^2,"Been wracking my brain for stuff to post here that won’t just be disappointing or have no definitive ending.


This story focuses more on the personal side of tech support instead of faulty tech but I felt this would be a good one to share.
This happened back in 2013/14-ish when I was desperately trying to cover a server monitoring and maintenance gig with only the faintest smattering of 0.5 tier server knowledge.

One of our client’s servers had conked out so completely and utterly that the vendor was flying in a technician from another country to help us either fix it or make sure we got the right replacement for it. 
Naturally I got picked to meet up with the tech and show him around. I guess my coworkers thought I needed to get away from the screen a while.  
Anyway, I’m waiting at the airport, scanning over the arrivals when my eyes fall on this guy in a suit jacket, metal band t-shirt and jeans with a maybe three or four day beard and ponytail. That can’t be the tech, right? Nah he can’t be. Next person, next, keep looking for our tech, next. Wait, did that band t-shirt guy just grab a travel case with a vendor logo on it? Damn he did and he’s coming this way. 
I intercept the guy and we do the meet and greet thing. I offered to give him a ride to his hotel and pick him up in a few hours but he wanted to head straight to the site and see what he was up against. During the ride to the site we chatted about all kinds of stuff like music (pretty much identical taste), books (sci-fi and fantasy both of us) and retro gaming (PSX vs N64, everlasting love for the SNES was mutual).


We eventually get to the site and get down to the nitty gritty. After a few hours of troubleshooting i can tell the tech is top-notch and we could definitely say the server was fsck’d beyond repair. RAID-0, obsolete equipment and beyond end-of-life software doesn’t play well together at the best of times, much less when one of the components does the digital equivalent of shooting a cylinder through the bonnet at highway speed.   
It’s now late afternoon and we decide to call it a day to regroup tomorrow. I drive him over to his hotel (with a in-depth discussion on the subject of SNES games during the ride there) and we agree to carpool to the site the next day. 


The next day I show up early to our predetermined meeting spot, since it’s opposite one of the best coffee places in town. After getting a cappuccino to go with a double espresso on the side I get back in my car and wait for the tech. Our agreed upon time comes and no tech in sight. 5 minutes pass, no tech. 10 minutes in and I’m starting to get worried. About 15 minutes after our agreed upon time the tech turns up looking like he hasn’t slept at all. He gets in the car without saying more than a quick “good morning”. None of the talkative banter we had yesterday was there and any question I asked to try to start a conversation was answered with either a noncommittal “uh-huh” or a shrug. 


Once back on site he focused solely on work, not chitchat, no banter, no nothing. Just coldly and efficiently sorting out what needed replacing, like a machine going through programmed motions. Something was seriously wrong. I have seen that behaviour a few times before and it’s never because something good has happened. Lunch swings around and I decide enough is enough. I took him out to a local joint that does awesome Thai food and after a lunch consisting of green curry chicken spicy enough to nearly blister the paint on the walls (it will cure what ails you or kill you, I swear) I decided to take the bull by the horns and ask him what was wrong. 


After a bit of verbal poking back and forth I finally crack his shell and got a lot more than I bargained for.   
Apparently he and his girlfriend had had an argument that night which had escalated into a shouting match, during which his girlfriend of three years had dumped him and told him outright that she had cheated on him for over two months. Add to that the fact she was his first girlfriend and his childhood crush and it’s clear why he was in such a state. We both knew that there wasn’t going to be much work done that afternoon and clocked out early. I had planned to drop him off at his hotel and go home but I ended up spending that whole day with him at his hotel room, just talking and being there for him. Now when I look back on it it was pretty weird, us having only met the day before but it felt like we had known each other for a lifetime. Any plans I had to go home for the night went right out the window when we ended up cuddling in his hotel bed. 


The next day we were both ready to tackle sorting out what needed replacing on site and after two weeks we had the new server up and running and taking traffic off of the temporary server my coworkers had set up. All’s well that end well, right?


We had some very memorable moments those two weeks but nothing serious came of it. We both agreed that long distance wouldn’t work out and neither of us was ready to just up and move to a new country on a whim. We kept in touch for a few years afterwards but last time we spoke he was about to get married. C’est la vie I guess.

Turns out their IT had performed an upgrade and broke it, and their IT provider was on holiday that day. To be helpful (big mistake), I dialled in, showed her where the new file that I emailed across should go. Literally a copy/paste job. I then wrote out a 3 step how-to on how to do this and emailed it with the new file they'd need. Looked a bit like this.

1. Download attachment on this email
2. Put that file in C:\program files\file
3. If it asks you to overwrite, click yes

The reason I did this because the client was running the software locally on their machines, meaning they'd need to perform this task on every machine in the office. I mean we're just the software providers, we shouldn't be messing with another company's machines. All they'd have to do is circulate this email and get everyone to do it. Easy right?

You can imagine how this went. Cue about 3 hours of heated arguments, calls from everyone on their team from the part time receptionist to their senior management and later directorial staff.

I have never been comfortable with Iphones... I don't personally own one. I was briefly issued one by this local government, but I never did much with it besides answer phone calls. We didn't really have any training or instructions for the Iphone and at the time of this call, I didn't have an Iphone to work with on my side. This will probably all seem sorta sad and pathetic to anyone who is really familiar with Iphones, but here we go. 


It's about 4:30pm. I normally clock out at 5pm, but 4:30 is when we more or less stop taking calls because we need to start doing our end of day tasks. Generally, unless it's an emergency, we don't do much more then enter a ticket after 4:30. Predictably, my phone rings right at 4:30. The user needs email set up on his phone.

A couple of weeks ago I am issued a ticket to stop over to a client to check and test a couple data jacks that are not working. I pulled up the clients address and navigate on over to the location as this was the first time for me to visit this client. I enter the large commercial building and check the directory for suite number and proceed to the floor. I am greeted to a locked and darken office with a hand written sign on the door that stated said client has recently moved to a new location. Strange, I call my PM and ask if he has sent me to the wrong location and he says, no. I confirm the address and I am on the right spot. I then call the client and he acts shocked to know that our company, the one he pays for IT support, does not know they have moved offices recently. He rattles off the new address and within 15 mins I am now at the new office across town.

I enter to find the new location is an existing office location but it’s network infrastructure is a disaster. The client barks orders as to the 5 locations that are not working, and then disappears on lunch. My PM phones to check on things and I relay the state of mess before me. I am then grilled for 10 mins by my PM to which I ask, “did we know they moved offices?” They moved offices!!!!? No one told us according to the PM.

Turns out he failed to properly shut down and transport and reinstall/reconnect his domain server, his on site VOIP server and a few other servers, the replaced damaged drives are slowly getting the backups reimaged. He changed his ISP and couldn’t get his SIP service in the new location so he had POTS line connected to serve his VOIP phones, previously served by SIP service, and I am sure I am missing a few other screw ups, like forgetting his APs on the ceiling of the old office, Landlord has locked him out for non payment of rent.

When I checked ticket history turns out days before he had called and logged a complaint about a couple computers and phones not working. When my company support tech couldn’t remotely connect, client claimed it was a couple bad cables...ticket was escalated to send me out to check for damaged infrastructure. Turns out client moved across town changed service type and providers and damaged his own servers, because to quote him “ he didn’t need and over paid nerd to connect a few computers and phones”.

Boss Mans phone is ringing, people wanting to the printers can't print, the world's on fire, then the phone stops. The phone system is now down.

Boss Man logs in to the server, the server starts to freeze, another server is half frozen, oh dear god. Hard reboot, no one can access emails. Great.

Restart the router, phones are back, kinda, you still can't use them to call, and apparently that's an important function.

I received an email this morning that had me do a double take. It was from one of my company's...less competent users (mind you these users are all mid 20s and should have a firm grasp on technology).

""Hi $pp, is this spam? I'm not with $randombank""

Curious, I read the email and come to several very quick conclusions. I'm sure you'll be able to get the gist of what they were. The email read something to the effect of;

&gt;\*Started with a missing header image (server unavailable)*

&gt;Hello $fish@ocean.com

&gt;You've submitted a payment to a new person

&gt;\*fake account details with not enough digits*

&gt;Amount: $800

&gt;Login now to confirm the payment

&gt;Please click *here* to cancel payment

&gt;Thanks for banking with $randombank

Now immediately a few things stand out;

1. They don't have an account with that bank

2. They didn't transfer $800 to anyone

3. None of the bank logos were there, just a missing header image. No signatures, no Facebook/Twitter icons or anything.

4. They never mentioned $fish's real name once, only ever by email address.

So with my most professional tone I sent back something to the effect of ""Well $fish, if you don't remember transferring $800 to anyone and you don't have an account with $randombank then we can probably assume it's fake.""

Even our most seasoned worker (mid/late sixties) just sat there in disbelief when I recounted the story to her.

I'd like to say the rest of the day was better but that would be a lie. Hence why I'm wasting time on here, telling you guys all about the users I deal with.",False,204,56,potplanty,talesfromtechsupport
73,"Processing, Do not remove card... (Part 1)","\#import &lt;firstTimePosting.h&gt;

\#import apologies.h

\#import &lt;POSJokes.h&gt;

Hi humans! This is gonna be (hopefully) a two-ish part story about some good ol' drama between me, *POS Company*, and my co-workers.

Okay so some context. I was hired by a grocery store with a focus on imported UK goods to initially do normal stocking and crappy stuff but was promoted to do tech around the store, including but not limited to the POS (no, it's point of sales ya' dummy!) system. For context, we were using *POS Company*, which revolves around the use of *Fruit Tablet* and such. The owners went with them because they gave us a cheap rate because we were the first grocery store to utilize their hardware (totally not beta testing...). Five-ish years later, the hardware they supplied us is annoyingly old. The card swipes couldn't do EMV (and yes, we got chargeback-ed all the time) and the *Fruit Tablet*s were EOL-ed by *Fruit*. 

Fast forward to two-ish months ago, I annoyed the owners and after two years, I finally got approval to upgrade the POS hardware. Didn't have any problems with it, it was faster than our old setup and we could finally be EMV-complient.

Fast foward to two-ish weeks ago, I purchased the new *Fruit Tablet*s from *Fruit* (I got some weird looks, but meh I've been through worse) and I installed them. I installed mobile management (basically connects to the wifi and a lock screen notice), installed the POS apps, and re-provisioned them according the *POS Company*'s specs. 

That's when it all started to go down hill. Fast.

The day after I installed the new *Fruit Tablet*s, it was great! You didn't have to wait 5 seconds to weigh the apples or wait 2 seconds to input cash, it was instant and everyone fell in love with it. If you ignore the fact that the *Fruit Tablet*s are physically smaller than the old ones so now I have to get approval to buy new stands (which will happen in 2 years), it was pure bless.

Sadly, Satan decided to ruin the fun.

A few hours after opening, there was this strange issue where using the chip would show ""Processing\n Do not remove card..."" until the card reader decided it took too long and it timed out. You had to try to do this 3-4 times before it would actually finish processing, and then half the time it would spit out a ""Declined"" error. But it actually charged the card, even though it was ""declined."" The weirder thing is that the problem only happened with one of the checkstands, the other one was processing payment swimmingly.

Oh, did I tell you we also had payments that were captured, but then declined?  (Kill me)

I tried to fix it doing everything I can (restarted the pin pads, restarted the *Fruit Tablet*s, re-provisioned the *Fruit Tablet*s, restored the *Fruit Tablet*s, reset the routers and modem, heck I even turned off and on the bed scanner cause I was a desperate man that needed a break). I called *POS Company* in desperation and in a nutshell, this is how it went:

&gt; POS: ""Did you try resetting the pinpads, the *Fruit Tablet*s, and any routers?""

&gt; Me: ""Yes""

&gt; POS: ""Did you tr-""

&gt; Me: ""Yes.""

&gt; POS: ""...ummm, let me transfer you to Tier 2""

&gt; Me: ""kk thanks""

I'm gonna skip over the boring stuff, like swapping the pinpads between the checkstands and resetting the backend, because none of that worked. After two weeks of suffering, pain, and many overtime hours, *POS Company* basically threw in the towel. That conversation went something like this:

&gt; POS: ""We don't know what's happening, we'll call you back""

&gt; Me: ""^#(#&amp; WHAT DO I TELL MY BOSS""

&gt; POS: ""We apologize for the inconvenience, but we'll get to the bottom of this""

&gt; Me: ""BUTBUT WHAT DO I TELL MY BOSS""

&gt; POS in a passive-agressive voice: ""Do you have anything else I can help you with?""

Note, I tried calling our payment processor but they told me that I don't have ""authorization to talk to them about this issue"" and that I need to contact *POS Company* or validate as an owner with a merchant ID and the bank account number where funds are deposited into (I don't have the bank account number, and more about the owners below), so that was a dead end.

During this time, my co-workers turned on me. They blamed me for breaking the system and preventing them from checking out anyone else. The owners, thankfully, are never in the store and don't respond to phone calls, so I was safe (for now...). I can't blame them for blaming me, but still, how should I've known that upgrading to new *Fruit Tablet*s could be such a hassle?

And that brings us to current day, where I have bickering co-workers, non-responsive owners, and a POS company that can't fix the bloody problem. I don't know when this will be fixed, and if it ever is, there shall be a part 2 of how the fk I get this stupid system to work.

74,"""Actually, I don't need your help after all!"" .... *incoming disaster*","Hello! I'm a long time reader, first time submitter! This story is about video editing software, and all the fun stresses of a young, overly confident student.

Starring:

* **My younger sister:** currently in her second year of university for film/media studies
* **Myself:** by no means a computer expert. A 2015 graduate of graphic design and currently working in digital design with some minor After Effects video editing sprinkled in
* **Our dad:** a backend developer who is the one responsible for me even getting into digital work at all, but has mentally halted in 2005 when it comes to new tech. Also an avid hater of all things Apple.


A short while ago, back around the beginning of the year, on a Sunday at 1pm, my sister attempts to FaceTime me. I was having brunch with someone, so I asked if she could call me back in an hour. About 10 minutes later she messages me *""Nevermind, I don't need your help! :)""*

I double checked *""Are you sure?""* and she insisted *""Yup! Don't worry about it"".* So I forgot about it.

Or so I thought.

Around 6:30pm that night while I was at home, I get another FaceTime call from her. Her face is red, tear-streaked, she's hysterically crying, basically screaming at me through the video feed, and hiccuping through her angry-tears.

**Sister:** It's fucked up! It's all fucked up! I don't know what the hell is going on but none of my work is saved! It's all gone! I don't get it! What the fuck! *[more swearing and declarations of confusion]*

**Me:** Hold on, what do you mean? What happened? What were you trying to do? Was this the same thing you called me about earlier?

**Sister:** YES!!! NONE OF MY WORK SAVED AND I JUST WASTED LIKE, FIVE HOURS! *AND* THIS IS DUE TOMORROW!

**Me:** .... Okay.... Well--

**Dad:** *[suddenly appearing in the background as he walks into the room with my hysterical sister]* You were supposed to help her! She called you and you didn't help. You know about this stuff, she doesn't!

**Me:** Okay, FIRST OFF, this is her school work, not mine. She's learning how to do this stuff, not me, and I'm not her teacher. Second, I'm not a video editor, I just use the programs a bit at work. I don't ""know these things"" any more than she could using Google to find a tutorial. THIRDLY, she said she didn't need me anymore! She said she figured it out and was very confident as such.

**Dad:** *[grumbling, not wanting to admit I'm right]*

**Me:** [Sister], what is the problem? What are you trying to do?

**Sister:** I have all this footage from my group project, and the cleaned up audio from [group member], and now it's my job to replace the old audio on the video with the new audio, and then give it back to the rest of my group.

**Me:** Alright. And what were you doing? Show me.

&gt;	*At this point I have her rotate her phone so I can see her laptop screen and make her walk me through her process. She was using Adobe Premiere, which I have very limited experience with, but is similar enough to After Effects (layout-wise anyway) that I can feel my way around.*

**Sister:** Okay so, I put my files in here... *[shows me the asset panel]* And then I pull the video in here... *[shows me her dragging it into the workspace panel]* And then I unattach the old audio and delete it. And then I pull in the new audio... and I highlight both, and click ""attach audio""...

**Me:** Okay, that all seems fine--

**Sister:** And then I hit the save button, and then I highlight it all and hit delete, and start the next one.

**Me:** OH MY GOD NO!

&gt;	*Now, if you know anything about Premiere or After Effects, you know that you have to save your work in sequences/compositions, which go in your asset panel as well. Otherwise it's just floating in nothing, goes no where, and disappears when you clear your workspace.*

**Sister:** What do you mean NO??? I SAVED IT!

**Me:** No, you didn't. You just drew something and shook the Etch-a-Sketch and started over. Every time you hit delete, you got rid of everything you did. Did you not think to check this? 

**Sister:** *[angry crying and hand motions of exasperation]*

**Me:** Uhh okay, well, let me figure this out...

I then proceeded to spend about 10 minutes making her click through Premiere for me to help her figure out how to create a new sequence, save it, and ensure it all showed up in the right place and didn't disappear anymore. Something she could have figured out herself if she used Google for like 2 seconds.

Anyway, end of the story: I called her the next day to ensure all went well, she she sort of bashfully told me it was fine and thanked me for helping her. I made her promise not to waste hours of time doing work she wasn't 100% sure she was doing right.

75,Impatient Customer,"My job is to provide technical support for 3D printers. Most of my exchanges are pretty tame, if mind-numbing, but there is one customer who has always made me wonder what was going on with him. Today I found out.

This customer opens multiple tickets in a week, often taking three or four responses to get the information I need to resolve the issue since it never seems like he can answer more than one question at a time, and yet many of his emails are interspersed with comments or critiques on how I format or phrase my questions and instructions. Today his ticket was about one of the motion directions not working correctly. 

I provided an explanation of why the problem would have developed, and included a link to our support article on the subject, which includes specifics on what tools and materials to use to perform the operation. When I include a link I always have the same format: I summarize what needs to be done and end the sentence with a colon. Then I skip a line, add the link, which is formatted blue, as most links are, and then another skipped line, so the link ends up as the only text in the middle of white space. Then I continue with any additional information. I have kept the same format for the last two years with very few problems.

This user came back with an immediate request for more information. Not a problem except that the questions he asked were answered in the introduction of the support article. Then he sent another response saying that he had found the information he needed in an old, out of date resource. So I referred him to the same link, pointing out that the answers were in the article and that the resource he was using was out of date and incorrect. As I attempt to give the benefit of the doubt, I said that if he wasn't able to click on the link please let me know and I would send him the article itself. His response was that he didn't see the link in my original email and that in order to be more clear I should format it in one of his three provided examples. Then he went on to state how he always had trouble with the support pages and how they should be indexed and linked. 

The part that I found most asinine about this whole exchange was that in the time required for four exchanges and to find the incorrect information in an old and out of date resource he could have read the original response, clicked on and read the link, and had all of the information he needed. Not to mention the time required to provide examples of how to format for his benefit. 

When I closed the ticket I mentioned that we had already provided the index for the support pages and it looked like he might be having trouble seeing links, so he might need to look into removing any customized color themes on his device of choice. His response:

"" I can see the links, in obvious blue, but not necessarily instantly recognize them as such. And can hardly see the colon at the end of a sentence that you probably think makes it obvious that the next line is a link. I'm always in a hurry here and skim for facts. Please make things more obvious.""

76,"""Just a patch""","This recently happened, and left me lightly irritated and stunned.

Some background: My official title and job description would be datacenter technician, but in reality i'm more a network admin/architect and sysadmin.  
The company I work for has multiple sites, but two main sites in the country, I work at the sister office, and the other office is our headquarters.

We are in the midst of phasing out a hop in our network, we used to have a dc in the middle of our route from the headquarters to sister dc.   
This was done because of the range, and because this hop allowed us access to some well connected datacenters and transits. As this situation has changed, and its costing us a lot of money to keep this site on-line, we're planning to get rid of it completely, by getting a direct layer-2 tunnel (dot1q) through a client/supplier of ours.

**$me**: keeper of (ssh) keys, protector of subnets and the spanning tree, guardian of the company's digital realm.

**$doofus**: sloth-like colleague at our HQ Datacenter

**$srtech**: my direct boss / senior technician, also my sparring partner for technical problems.

**$nondoofus**: other colleague at our HQ Datacenter, is not sloth-like, or a doofus.

We start our adventure with $srtech, who is ordering our layer2 tunnel at our supplier.

&gt;$srtech: I'm trying to order this l2 line but its taking forever to get a hold of someone, please escalate.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Maybe we should try 'stalking' our account manager every single working day?  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: Let's do it.

And so it became, that we phoned up our account manager every single day until that line was delivered, but little did we know that this was only the start of our misfortune.

&gt;$srtech: Hey, line's been delivered at last, I'll e-mail you port positions so we can get the patches made.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, I'll start configuring some ports so we can test this sucker.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: Make sure you call up $doofus so he can patch the tunnel on our end at HQ.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: sure.

So I ring up $doofus with the port positions so he can make a patch.

&gt;$me: Yo $doofus, I need a favor, can you make a patch from SUPPLIER\_SWITCH\_PORT to OUR\_PORT for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: oh and before I forget, I need this done by the end of the day so I can test this thing.  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: sure thing I'll give you a call when it's done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: cool, thanks!

In the meantime I get our intern to make the patch from the supplier to our core switch in our datacenter, and I'm ready for liftoff, awaiting $doofus.

A few hours later I still haven't gotten a call, but it's the end of the day, so I figure I'll call the next day.

&gt;$me; Hey $doofus, did you get that patch done for me that I asked about yesterday?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: Nah it was too busy.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* at this point I already know he's talking out of his ass, because he does fuck all every day. \*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: oh that sucks, but I really need this thing today, so can you please shift some stuff in your 'schedule' and do it ASAP?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: sure I'll see what I can do.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, thanks.

As it so happens, $doofus came up from his chair, and wrestled the very dangerous Cat6A UTP snake into the cable rails, and into the ports. So a little after lunch I was finally able to get my testing going.

&gt;\&gt; I start by bringing up the ports on both ends, which goes a little as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Port goes into autonegotiate  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  
&gt;  
&gt;\*2 seconds\*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;Link state down, protocol down.

At this point I've been diagnosing for about an hour, trying to change duplex modes, changing speed modes, autonegotiate, nothing works.

I ring up the supplier and ask them what's what.

&gt;$me: I'm having some issues with a connection, it keeps coming up on half-duplex, and goes down again after a bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Hm let me take a look.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*about an hour of back-and-forth troubleshooting, trying different MTU values, different speeds, duplex modes, nothing works.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: confusing how it goes online only when you set it to half-duplex 100mbit/s, could this be a cabling issue  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Not sure, it does have connection, so it seems cabling is not at fault.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: What type of switch are you running on your end?  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: it's a Cisco Catalyst 3560G.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Okay I've got a cisco 7609 on my end, so it shouldn't be a problem, but I'll go look up some datasheets and get back to you if i find a possible solution.  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Alright that's good, talk to you later.

At this point I'm looking up the port features for this C3560G because I've got a suspicion it doesn't have the fancy features my switch has.  
And then it hits me in the face like a flyswatter hitting you at mach 5.

    Auto-MDIX is enabled by default. When you enable auto-MDIX, you must also set the interface speed and duplex to auto so that the feature operates correctly.

The port we have from our supplier is hard-set to 100mbit/s, so its not on auto.

I enter the datacenter floor wielding a pair of side cutters, RJ45 crimpers, and an RJ45 connector and do my magical TIA 568A to TIA 568B cross cable trick.

Back at the office I log into the switch, turn the port back on with the settings correct.

&gt;\&gt; Link state down, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Full duplex, 100Mbit/s

I do a little victory dance and quickly grab my phone to call up $doofus.

&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $me, what's up?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus there, I need a favor.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: No he's out of office at the moment, can I leave a note?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Yeah can you ask him to make that cable he patched for me yesterday into a cross-cable?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Sure I'll tell him.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Awesome, thanks!

The next day I ring up $doofus, to ask him if he got around to making that cross-cable, but obviously he was too busy doing whatever.

Another day passes before I finally have enough control over the Force to lift $doofus out of his chair to get him to do something for me.

&gt;$me: Hey $doofus did you make that cross-cable for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: Yeah I made the cross-cable, its all good and patched in the DC.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, I'll go and test it later.

And so later that day I start to test it.

&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up

At this point I'm beating my head against the desk in a vain attempt to mix up the information in my head into a solution, to no avail.

I think to myself, $doofus must know how to make a cross-cable right? But it's doing the exact same thing when we had a straight cable connected...

And so I pick up the phone once more...

&gt;$nondoofus: Hey $me, what's up?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus around, i need to ask him something.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: he just left his spot, probably going to the bathroom.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: alright, maybe you know, did he happen to test the cable before he patched it?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah he used the cable tester and he said all lights lit up just fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: all lights lit up huh? with that 10$ cheap-o-meter you guys use, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus; yeah I think so, oh here comes $doofus, I'll ask him real quick.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*$nondoofus asks $doofus if the cable tester had all lights on during testing.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: yeah he says all lights lit up on the tester.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay, can you please drive to the DC for me, with a pre-made, known-good cross cable, and an RJ-45 coupler?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah sure, but why?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: please just trust me and do it please.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: ok sure, I'll call you when I'm at the datacenter.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, thank you.

At this point I have a 99% certainty what the problem is here, and I wish I could bitch-slap $doofus so hard it goes down 3 generations.

Half an hour passes and $nondoofus rings me up

&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $Me, I'm at the datacenter, what do you want me to do?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Okay walk to our core switch, and unplug the port that $doofus patched on.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay now connect the coupler block, and connect the crosscable to the port and the coupler.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: alright that's done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Ok give me a second to verify.

I log in to the switch and turn on the port.

&gt;  
&gt;$me: when you get to the storage closet, I want you to pick up the old Cisco 7201 router we have lying around there, and I want you to hit $doofus with it so hard, that he comes back to his senses.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: \*laughing loudly\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: why's that? \*still laughing\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Because this idiot made a STRAIGHT cable, when I asked him to make a CROSS cable.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: The reason is, he used that cheap shitty tester you guys have, and it only measures straight cables properly.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: all lights lit up, indicating it was a straight cable..  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: haha, this is going to make for a great story.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: thanks a lot $nondoofus, I'll talk to you later.

Flabberghasted I tell the story to $srtech.

&gt;$me: Finally managed to get that L2 tunnel online.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: Really? finally. what was the problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: $doofus.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: \*looks at me confused\* eh, what?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: I asked him to make a cross cable for me, and he made a straight cable, convinced it was cross.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: I asked $nondoofus to put in a good pre-made cross-cable with a coupler, it works now.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: \*laughing at this point\* Good.

And that is how my colleague managed to waste a few days of my time troubleshooting by not knowing how to use the equipment he has to handle.

To this day I'm not sure he really knows how to make a cross-cable, and I don't intend to ask him to make one for me again.

77,Kicking the Ant Hill,"So, late last week an app shat itself.

We're still doing the post-mortem, but it looks like:
Either an HBA or an integrated RAID controller had a hardware fault.  This tickled an OS bug, and the kernel sneezed.  And by sneezed, I mean ""Printed a helpful error message and panic'd without producing a core dump"".

That panic confused Orrible cluster, but the node eventually got evicted.  Before, during or after the eviction, 20 - 30 tables in the database got corrupted.  Oh, and the replication software shared those tables worldwide.  The DBA team can find and correct the corruption, but only on weekends, since the app is mission critical.

If you're thinking, ""Oh, this will lead to tears before teatime"", you're correct.  (You're probably also a fan of or should look into [Simon R. Green](http://simonrgreen.co.uk/), whose books are peppered with these quips.)

78,Possibly the ugliest hack I've ever had to do...,"So, back to my days offshore... Because our boats were overseas or in the middle of the ocean, we had spares for pretty much everything.

So, we've been out to sea for a couple of weeks and all is well. My processing station had a SCSI external drive enclosure with 6 5.25"" bays. In this tower were 4 hard drives and two tape drives. I don't recall if we had 18gb drives or 9gb drives, but they were in a RAID 5 and we had a pair of Exabyte 8mm tape drives in the same enclosure. After about two weeks, my daily backups started having issues. Sometimes failing completely, sometimes taking far longer on one drive than the other ( we always made tapes in pairs ). After 3-4 days of random weirdness, tape drive 0 stopped responding completely.

Well, crap! That's not good. So, I pull tape drive 0 out and put in one of our spare tape drives. We had four tape drives that were ready to be used and we had two spares. Things were great for another week or so, then tape drive 1 starting failing. The difference is that instead of misbehaving for 3-4 days, it just stopped responding. Okay, now I'm getting worried. I swap in our last spare and 2 days later, the new tape drive 0 dies. I'm down to just drive 1, now backups are taking twice as long. The next day, drive 1 goes offline. There is no way in hell I killed 4 tape drives in two weeks. For all the spares we had on board, the one thing we didn't have a spare for was the actual enclosure that the tape drives were in. I swapped SCSI cables, unseated and reseated basically everything. Nothing helped. I decided that maybe, just maybe it was a power issue. I didn't have a spare tower, but what I did have was a single bay external cdrom enclosure. So, I pulled the cover off the big tower and pulled the cover off the small enclosure and I ran the molex power cables from the small enclosure to the tape drives in the big enclosure. Voila! Everything worked! The only problems were... I didn't have ANY other spare power supply, the covers had to be off of both cases, the cables in the small enclosure were so short that I had to lean it against the big tower to reach. So... we spent the rest of the job with those two enclosures bungee corded together and both bungee corded down to the desk ( this was a ship, after all ). I was able to verify that all four tape drives were perfectly fine, they just weren't receiving enough power. The client rep actually took pictures of my kludge and sent them to his boss. I got an atta boy and I made sure that we had spare power supplies and a spare tower for all future jobs.",False,126,20,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport

$HelpDesk =  HelpDesk technician.

$FieldSupport = Myself, ultra-charming, and handsome.

$Client = Obviously, the client.

Early Monday morning, a call comes in:

$FieldSupport = Hello, $FieldSupport, how can I help?

$Client= Hi, $FieldSupport, my PCs got *that* issue again.

This client has a PC running 3 screens via a mount, where the 3rd screen is configured as the ""far right"" panel, and is set as the primary screen for *all* PowerPoint and FireFox sessions as it's customer facing. They'd be having this issue where all their applications were defaulting to this screen for ""an unbeknownst reason"".

$FieldSupport = Hi $Client, I'm not sure what problem you're referring to directly, have you lodged a HelpDesk ticket for this?

$Client = What do you mean?

$FieldSupport = You know the icon on your Desktop that says IT Support? The big button on the Intranet for IT Support?

$Client = Oh you mean ServiceDesk?

$FieldSupport = Yes $Client, that. Raise a ticket and let them do some troubleshooting, I'll get the ticket escalated if I am needed.

So a few hours pass, and I get another charming call.

$HelpDesk = Hey $FieldSupport, been working on an issue with $Client and it looks like they have a dodgy cable. 
I've gone through all the tests, you need to get them a DVI to HDMI cable.

$FieldSupport = The PC they're using has 2x DP and 1x DVI, and no monitors we use in our environment have HDMI, so can you tell me why you've come to this conclusion?

$HelpDesk = I spoke to $Client and that's what they said they use. They sent me a photo and everything.

So I go on site, expecting to see some form of idiocy. I immediately get hit with this:

$Client = Hi $FieldSupport. We worked with $Client and we've come to the understanding that this issue is 100% the program.

$FieldSupport = Yeah? What program are you referring to, $Client?

$Client = Windows 10.

$FieldSupport = You're running Windows 7, $Client. Why don't you elaborate on your issues?

After being wasted for about 20 minutes on other unrelated issues, he demonstrated something amazing. He had somehow rigged the HDMI cable into the DP port on the back of a screen. Not only that, everytime he would attach power to it (as he constantly disconnected it) would the other monitors trip, his PC would eventually suffer a BSOD. 

So gun-go, replace the cable that I'm not sure where he got it from and the issue resolved. Goes to show that sometimes eyes on the fault help, right?",False,165,22,dankynanky,talesfromtechsupport
81,I can't print all my pages at once,"So, this is a story from a year or so ago. Let me set the scene, I'm a games developer, which means that my family and friends tend to assume that I'm some sort of all knowing computer focussed deity. This leads to many Tech support phonecalls, usually for 5 minute solutions like, ""OfficialPiAddict, I can't figure out how to turn in this windows desktop, the power button doesn't do anything"". To which I tell them to look for a ""big box under the desk"". That usually resolves the problem. 

My grandmother however, usually manages to get herself into more sticky situations. While I have many tales of her Tech issues, the one that stands out the most is the following.

Grandma: Hey OfficialPiAddict, sorry to bother you, but I'm just working on a book at the moment, and I want to print it.

Me: That sounds great grandma, have you tried going to File-&gt;Print?

Grandma: *minute of deliberation* Yes. I've tried that. 

Me: Okay, well did that work for you?

Grandma: No. It only printer a single page.

Me: When you open the print dialogue, can you see a little field that mentions a ""page range""?

Grandma: *minute of working* yes.

Me: Great, what does it say there?

Grandma: it says All.

*At this point I double check with her that the values are correct, and they are. I'm thinking that Word might be bugged, so I ask her to restart her computer. She does, and there's no change. I'm getting a bit confused here, as I run through some other common problems with her. It's now ~20 minutes into the call*

Me: Okay grandma, can you just run me through how you make your book?

Grandma: yes. What I do is, I type down what I want it to say. Then I put in my images, and I arrange them on the page where I want them.

*So far so good*

Grandma: And then when I want a new page, I go to the top, and I press on the file. And then I press new, and it gives me a new page.

..........

This took me a second to process. After some investigation, it turned out that she had created an entire 250 page book, filled with formatting and images, and every single page was it's own document. She had a folder of 250 word documents that she wanted to print.

I explained it all to her, and mentioned that a new page would just appear on its own when you got to the bottom of a document. She then hung up, and went about collating the documents.

I do BI development work. I was recently developing a SSRS report to generate a list of data for users whenever they wanted query the live data instead of a daily emailed list. Once I finished, I asked for a list of names to grant access to the report. There were two people I couldn't find in any of our address books, so I asked the guy I had been liaising with to find out the Windows usernames of those I couldn't find. He CC'd them into our emails, so I eagerly awaited a reply. So of course the first reply was a bit of an eye opener:

83,Why Didn't You Just Asked For Me?,"So this tale took place years ago when I was still working for a major ISP here in the states. Some back story of what I did and the product that I'm about to tell: I was originally hired as tier 2 tech and was on many different projects and was first hired about a year after they've released their new product. About a year and a half of working their, this ISP finally released static IPs for customers who wanted them (pretty cheap too, it was $5 for a block of 8 IPs if I recall correctly). Problem is that the static IPs aren't actually truly ""static"" in the sense that you can simply plug it into whatever you're using it for and it'll work and what not. No, this is what you'll call Sticky IP. There is a way to get it to work the original way but it's a PITA and half the time it doesn't work so just doing it the way that this ISP wants you to do it is the only viable option.

At the time of this call that came it, it was when our call center was still business support and click to chat. I was sitting next to my coworker and he just got done helping this customer getting his Sticky IP address setup and confirmed to work for a server that he was trying to get setup but now this customer has a question about setting up the DNS for it to work correctly. Mind you this coworker I'm sitting next to is also a roommate, we both know each other strengths and weakness and he knows that I know quite a bit about DNS and how it works so he asked me if I can take the call and help him out with his question. Sure no problem.

So he passes me the call and I started talking with the customer. He told me what he was trying to do. Basically he's trying to set it up so when someone types in an address of [whatever.yourname.com](https://whatever.yourname.com) it'll go to his static (sticky) IP address. He also informed me that he's under the impression that he needed to do this with a reversed DNS.

First of, if you have any clue how DNS works, the only time you would need to worry about a reverse DNS is if you're setting up an email server on that IP address to help ID other mail servers the origin of the email did came from the IP address, very rare other protocols would bother with reverse DNS look ups.

Second, I can't really fault the guy into thinking that since a few agents in the center told him that and that's because most agents doesn't have a clue how DNS works. Doesn't help that most of them aren't truly techs since our scope of support is limited to just making sure that the gateway is getting sync/service and making sure that there isn't much wrong with the hardware. The only thing extra that we do is making sure that the sticky IPs are configured correctly in the gateway and even then only a good handful of agents are good at that (my roommate was god at this and can make sure your device is getting that damn sticky IP address otherwise it'll drive him mad until he gets it working).

Anyways, I told him a reverse DNS is not needed unless he's planning on running an email server off of that IP address and told him what he really needed to do, to go into the registrar or whoever is managing the DNS and add an A record of [whatever.yourname.com](https://whatever.yourname.com) pointing to the static IP that my roommate helped him set up (and works when going to the IP address). So after he confirmed what was needed, I offered to give him a call back the next day to make sure it was working since DNS propagation takes time. He agreed and went on our way.

Next day I called him and he told me that the server had died which was ironic since he was all set, everything was working, couldn't wait to show his client the finished product when the server died. Told him no problem and gave him my agent ID and told him that when he gets the server back up and working and needs help with getting the static IPs reconfigured and what not to call and ask for me by my agent ID.

About 3 weeks pass and never heard from him, and honestly completely forgotten about him (you know, working in a call center, you deal with about 20 to 40 customers a day) until he called and luckily gotten me. Only reason I even remembered him was because the moment I pulled up his account and saw my case notes and him describing my issue I knew who I was talking to.

Turns out that he lost my agent ID that he had written down, got the new server and needed help with getting it configured, thought he'd tried his luck with other agents but the other agents did jack shit (other then to put in a request to set up reverse DNS which was completely unnecessary for his application, and he's been fighting the battle for about 2 weeks, probably less.

I was like, ""OK, so just to be sure, you have not changed your DNS record at all during this all time, right? [whatever.yourname.com](https://whatever.yourname.com) is still pointing to this IP address, right?"" and the customer confirmed. So I logged into our gateway, confirmed how his server is configured and is currently set for DHCP, confirmed the device, and reset back up the sticky IP. We've tested it, confirmed it's working, and the customer was glad he was able to talk to me in the end.

tl;dr: customer needed DNS setup for his static IP, informed him how to go about it, his server crashed, provided agent ID so he can talk to me to make sure everything is set back up correctly once new server comes in, customer lost it and went through hell for about 2 weeks before luckily getting a hold of me from a random luck of the draw and fixed his issue that other agents couldn't figure out wasting the customer's time.",False,156,3,scsa20,talesfromtechsupport

85,"The financial cost of denial, a tale of networking woes.","I work for a large healthcare equipment manufacturer, as a network engineer. My job is largely helping to integrate our equipment into the hospital network to allow communication. Because our equipment is regulated by the FDA, most of our policies and procedures are outdated and incredibly insecure. As such most of my time is apologizing for our policies and helping to find more secure ways to isolate our equipment, however when a hospital seems to be experiencing a network problem, I often get calls to assist in troubleshooting.

Now for a large chunk of our customers we provide switches to provide an isolated environment for our equipment that we maintain, but for customers that don't want the added cost, or added rack space, we also allow them to connect our equipment to their network directly, provided that a) we validate that the network meets our specs, and b) they assume responsibility for any issue with their network. Of course the problem with this is that like all good network engineers know, it's not the network. It's never the network.


But unfortunately this time it definitely was.

**The start of our tale**

Our story starts Friday morning at 11:30, one of my field engineers contacts me to let me know that he had received reports from a local hospital that their equipment had gone down. This particular hospital had our equipment directly connected to their network, and this issue had occurred previously. The last time I had driven the three hours to the site, spent hours troublshooting our equipment only to receive a call the next morning to check if things were working now and everything to come up.

This time I was far too busy to drop everything and head off to the site, so I asked my coworker to move one of the non working pieces of equipment to the same switch as the controller it was supposed to register to, and see if it connected. If the connection worked, it stood to reason that the issue resided on the only part removed, the hospital network.

Later that evening as I was headed out with the wife to a friend's house, I got a call from my coworker saying that he had done this, but had only been able to get ahold of the hospital on call network admin as the on site contact had left at 4 with things to do. Unfortunately fifteen minutes into talking to the on call person, and trying to explain how the issue clearly resided on their network, we were cut off because she ""had another issue to deal with, and I can clearly ping all of the switches""

**A dangerous situation **

A brief aside here, this equipment is not some low priority value adding equipment. People's lives are attached to the operation of this equipment, and this outage was putting multiple people at risk. We learn early on to take these kinds of issues extremely seriously as a fault of our equipment that we ignore can leave us potentially personally liable. As such my coworker spent every minute he could on Saturday and Sunday trying to get the attention of someone in the IT organization to take this outage seriously.

Finally Sunday night someone finally checked their messages, or the right ear got shouted in, and the issue became priority one. A bridge line was put together and the IT team was engaged, but as this was now a hot issue, no one wanted to take the blame. This was clearly an issue with the vendors equipment and they needed to stop blaming their network. I did my best to show that our equipment was working properly when isolated from the network, and requested packet captures to be able to pinpoint the source of the issue.

I mentioned that this behavior I was seeing felt very much like some bizarre behavior with the connections between the switches (for the more technical, I specifically felt like this was something with the ether channel that connected the edge switches with two ten gig fiber lines back to their cores) this issue was shot down with an insistance that we troubleshoot first one then the next piece of our equipment and run in circles, until I was forced to drop off the call around 10 pm.

**A long and frustrating night**

The next day I was occupied with other work, but about 9pm I get a call from my coworker on site asking to join the call again, as we have escalated this internally to our company, and a second field engineer had been sent on site. Once again I ask for packet captures to test my theory and once again get shot down. I spend **7** hours on the phone doing everything I can, and finally get them to span the ports that I need and send me the packet capture. In it, things look strange indeed. The registration packet of the device is indeed arriving at our controller, only to be ignored. This is beyond nuts to me and I briefly lose confidence that this is actually their network. We start swapping equipment around and bring in new equipment and yet no matter what we see the same effect, but only if the equipment is connected through their network. If it's moved to the same switch it connects immediately, once again pointing back to the hospital network.

Finally at 5 am I drop off the call, needing to be on site at a different project early the next day, but troubleshooting continues through the night. Another field engineer is sent on site to help, and two more escalation people are brought in to troubleshoot. The same troubleshooting steps get repeated over and over again in escalation hell, and each time it points to the hospital network, but the network team has dug in their heals.

**Anger begins to boil over**

The next day I join the call around 10am. We are berated by person after person from hospital IT for insisting this issue resided on their network. They are insisting on alternative equipment be shipped out right away (which we do) and complain that next flight out isn't fast enough. We are called incompetent and are told that we were not treating this issue with the severity it deserved. To the credit of my team we kept our comments civil, and our accusations on mute at least, despite many of us having been working on the issue for most of the past few days, giving up lots of personal time and sleep. I end up being mostly redundant at this point, and since I have nothing much to contribute to the call I end up dropping off around 10 pm to try and get some sleep. 

**A bizarre answer **

The next day I get a request from my boss to join an internal call around 11 am. This issue has escalated to the point that one of our coders has taken a look at the packet capture and noticed something. With the data portion of the packet, the devices MAC address and IP address are included, but the IP address portion of the the data has been changed from 10.x.x.x to 11.x.x.x. This suddenly explains why our system isn't responding to it, the address is completely incorrect now. Of course we don't know what is changing this packet, but we have solid proof now that this is not a fault with our equipment. We jump back on the call and present our findings.

**Sunk cost behavior**

Now of course this is day six of a major outage. Additional staff have been forced to work long shifts on the clinical side to deal with this situation and every executive has been on this call screaming for a solution. Hospital IT has been standing their ground this whole time that this issue is not on their network, so their response is to argue, to obstruct, and try to disprove this new info, going so far as to accuse us of making this up. 

New packet captures are made, different pieces of equipment are removed and added and still the same result. I once again interject that this feels very much like an ether channel issue, and that it had been mentioned to be related to that previously. The lead network engineer of the hospital nearly lost his voice shouting me down that unless I had concrete proof I wasn't to bring up ether channels again.

Finally we were able to convince them to get a capture of each hop. From each side of the connection working our way down the line. Finally we see it. A capture shows that between the core and the switch that has the controller, the data in the packet is changed. Someone else internal asks us to take this down to a single connection to see if this resolves the issue and after one last smoke screen from the hospital IT claiming that the information is changed even in the functioning device, a claim very easily and quickly shot down, they begrudgingly agree to take down one of the legs of the ether channel.

** OH Shit. **

After a brief issue with the ether channel breaking the connection entirely, finally one leg is taken down. Almost immediately, a huge chunk of the down network comes back. Everything starts to work, and those that were still having issues are able to be restored by breaking a leg on the switch ether channel.

 Suddenly hospital IT has become very quiet. I'm listening in on the call on mute, shouting abuse and laughing like a mad man in my car as I am driving. Text messages between my coworkers are flying laughing at the sudden cooperation we are being offered, as IT states they will have to open a ticket with their network vendor to find a root cause. After almost a week of critical outage time, the issue has been resolved by the very thing I had mentioned to them on the first day of the outage. 

Now to be one hundred percent fair, this is a very rediculous thing to happen. As one of my coworkers mentioned, this is like writing a letter, addressing it, and when it gets to its destination, still perfectly sealed, the contents of that letter are different. It shouldn't happen, and it really doesn't make a lot of sense, but after spending days being treated like a liar and a dunce, being right felt really, **really** good. 

**The fallout**

Now during this call a LOT of big wigs at my company had been listening in, and they were very unhappy with the way our team had been treated. All of my team received instructions to make sure to log every possible minute of our time that we had spent working on this issue within the day. See this customer had not paid for a support contract with us Normally for a customer outage like this, we will usually ignore that to try and bring the system up, preferring happy customers, but in a wonderful foresight, the coworker who had gone on site the first day, had made sure to get a PO for this support call. The higher ups had paid for rush shipping, couriers, and nearly twelve resources on site or on remote support to appease this customer only to have the fault be exactly what had been communicated to them on the first day.

A call was put together and a full time-line was worked up. None of it looked good for the customers IT team. In the heat of the outage the hospital big wigs had requested my company management team come for an on site meeting to discuss this issue, likely thinking that they would be able to squeeze out some favors and financial benefits from the fiasco, and now our execs were looking at handing over what will likely be a five or six figure bill.

Meanwhile at the hospital, it was clear that IT was hoping to do damage control, they threw a ""Thank you"" party for their network team for finding the issue, but our team made sure that the full story was given to the clinical team. We got a very awesome thank you from the nurses later that day.

In the end we got a lot of praise from our bosses and we all felt good having actually found the root of this issue, something that may save us a lot of time in other similar situations down the road. For my coworkers, their paychecks are going to look really nice with all the overtime they were able to squeeze in (though unfortunately as a salary man I can't say the same) I definitely hope to hear what the vendor says was actually changing the data as it's a crazy bug, but in the end I think we were all too tired to really appreciate the shear train wreck beauty of this, so I felt I had to bring it to reddit.

87,Touchpad weirdness,"I've been trying to think of a more recent tale to tell and life just handed me an opportunity. Rather than going back 18 years, this story is from last week. 

I'm currently working for a municipal police department with roughly 250 officers. The IT staff at the PD consists of 3 people; a programmer, a systems analyst, and a technical specialist. The idea is that the systems analyst handles server side stuff, the technical specialist handles user side stuff, and the programmer supports in house software and/or interfacing existing data with new software. In reality, it doesn't really break down that way. 

An officer drops his laptop off with a note saying that the touchpad on his laptop doesn't work. My coworker ( systems analyst ) plugs the laptop in on our test bench and the touchpad works fine. She tries various things and nothing she can do replicates the problem. She puts a note on the laptop saying that it appeared to be working and left it in the watch office for him. 

The officer drops the laptop off again the next day with a note saying that the touchpad still doesn't work. Again, she is unable to replicate the problem. She brings me in and tells me the symptoms and we decide that it must be something local to the officer's vehicle. We ask the officer to come by during business hours for us to take a look. 

The officer comes by and we both verify that the touchpad is working. He starts plugging things in before I can stop him, and he's got a USB hub with 4 or 5 things plugged in, a power cable, a network cable, his GPS, etc... The touchpad no longer works. I assumed it had something to do with the USB hub and perhaps a faulty usb device, so I had him unplug that. The touchpad still doesn't work. I have him reboot the machine, but the touchpad STILL doesn't work. I have him unplug EVERYTHING, and the touchpad starts working again. After a little trial and error, we figure out that the touchpad stops working when the power is plugged in. 

I go to my office and grab a brand new power supply for him and as soon as we plug it in, the touchpad stops working. I am now dumbfounded. While I'm trying to puzzle out how this could possible be, the officer tells me that if he wiggles the power connector at the back of the laptop, his touchpad works intermittently. Huh, okay... Some sort of EMI from a bad solder joint on the motherboard power connector? So... I open a support ticket with the laptop manufacture. We discuss the symptoms we're seeing, run some diagnostics that all come up clean, and he decides to send out an internal power cord ( replacement DC jack ). 

We swap out the jack, and the problem still exists, but only in the vehicle. I notify the laptop manufacturer and this time they send out a palmrest and motherboard. We get those swapped out, and the problem persists. I tell the officer that I'm going to give him a different inverter for his vehicle and he tells me that he already has a spare. I asked him to try using the spare inverter and report back. After the weekend, I have an email from the officer saying that he's still unable to use his touchpad. I am now completely stumped. We've changed EVERYTHING, right? I start doing research, I ask every tech person I can think of about the problem and we come up with absolutely nothing 

The sergeant of planning and research comes by yesterday and tells me that he fixed the problem. How you ask? By changing out the officer's inverter. He apparently had a faulty inverter in his car. Which inverter did the sergeant swap for the faulty one? The spare that the officer already had.

\*sigh\* 

The officers are generally VERY good at following directions and giving good information about what they're seeing and what they've tried. This is a very unusual case in many ways, but I thought I had lost my tech touch. Sometimes I forget that even the best users lie, but that was only a very small piece of a very weird problem.

88,Please do not use. This is possessed! It will not let me log back in.,"In my last post I said that I would tell this story which comes from the same account I work with, a private Christian school. To preface this story a little bit, my boss (who happens to be my father) and I started working there last year around September. Before we were there they had a teacher they promoted with zero technical knowledge doing things for a year after their full-time IT person that worked on everything from the cashiers in the snack shack to the servers and firewalls got let go. That IT manager, who we will refer to as Kelly, was very strict with her users and would not let them move even a single cable or device from one desk to another without her permission. She changed settings in the Active Directory to make users have to change their password every 3 months, so teachers and administrators usually had to make a new password 3 times during an entire semester. The teacher dekstops are Acer workstations from 2007 that came with Vista and have been upgraded to Windows 7. Of course, with this old hardware the computers have issues from time to time and they slow down and crash.

Which brings me to my story about one of my users, a middle school teacher I will refer to as **Crazy Lady** or **CL** for short. She is an older lady, probably in her 60s and has a shrill old lady voice, you can tell she is probably one of students least favorite teachers. I have been in her room before and heard her talking trash on her students to the other teachers about their math skills, as if she was not there to teach them anything and they were expected to be exceptional at math by the time they got to her class in middle school.

The first time I met her was when I first heard about her computer troubles. It was the first week of school, and she was outside near the lunch tables as I was walking back up to my office. She flagged me down and wanted to meet me, I said hello and told her my name and she told me hers. Immediately after she started complaining about a computer problem she was having.

**CL:** We need more help here. My computer has problems all the time! I will be doing something on it, and then the next second it will just crash and shut down on me!

**Me:** Oh no, you say it crashes on you? What are you doing before the computer crashes usually?""

**CL:** YES! It always crashes and it's so SLOW! Many times it won't let me log in no matter what I try, it is possessed!""

At this point I just thought she was using a metaphor for how crappy the computer is.

**Me:** Well, i'm sorry to hear that, I could take a look at it and see what is going on if you have time.""

**CL:** No, no! Don't even bother! They have tried to look at it many times, and it never lets me login to it. It is haunted, don't go near it.

It's.. Haunted? I don't really know what to say here, as it seems she doesn't want me to try looking at it.

**Me:** Okay, well.. I guess just try again and if you have problems or want me to take a look at it let me know my office is-

**CL:** It's okay! Don't worry about it! I powered it down, Pepe is sleeping right now. He just needs a good nap and maybe he will feel better.

Did.. Did she just say Pepe? Is the computer named Pepe? I definitely heard her say Pepe as if that was the computer or maybe the ghost's name.

**Me:** Okay.. Well you have a good day now.

**CL:** You too!

That's where we parted ways, but that's not the end of the story.

A few months after this we needed to install a client on everyone's machine for antivirus and remote monitoring. My dad wanted us to start in the middle school wing and move on from there. I see on his list that we have to do Crazy Lady's machine and I tell my dad ""Hey, this is the lady that thinks her computer is haunted."" He thought it was kind of funny but not as funny as I did, and we got through the other machines and got into her room and approached her computer.

As we approached her computer, I noticed some pieces of paper taped to the top and the front of the computer. I read them, and this is what they said:

*Please do not use. This is possessed! It will not let me log back in.*

*Please do not touch.*

I was cracking up in the classroom. My dad saw them and his expression was something between ""What the hell"" and ""Why do we have to deal with these crazies"". He sat down at the computer and I asked him if he was scared of the ghost inside of the computer, to which he replied no. The computer was already powered on and we logged on with our administrator account and installed our antivirus and remote monitoring software. We left the room and that was the last I have heard from Crazy Lady since then, other then the time I went into another teacher's classroom when she was there and trash talking one of her students. I think that she has since resigned or been let go, because I did not see her name on any of the rooms in the middle school wing, one can only hope. She creeps me out. I don't think she even uses her computer at all, we have not been requested to change her password even once, and we changed the Active Directory settings to password changes once at the start of a new semester.",False,134,24,1D10TError404,talesfromtechsupport
89,... and nothing was ever resolved. The end.,"I work for a cable ISP as tier 1 tech support. Mostly dealing with basic tech support issues: pay your bill on time, powercycle, password resets, ect. This story takes place over three separate calls. Two were mine, one was taken by the person sitting next to me, but all dealing with the same users.  Just a heads up, there's no happy ending here. Nothing gets resolved, just customers being unreasonable and making jerks of themselves. Out of curiosity, I do want to know how this story ends, so I'll be checking this account on Monday to see what/if there was a resolution to this.

**Call 1**

VK: {$GenericTechSupportIntro}

AS: Hey, yeah, I just got transferred to you to activate something on my account. I'm not sure exactly what.

VK: Ok, let's pull up your account and I'll take a look.

*This customer was cold transferred from either billing or sales, by the sound of  things. I pulled the account, everything looks normal. Account's active. Modem's online. Nothing out of the ordinary-looking. And of course, the previous rep didn't leave any notes.*

AS: (*talking while I'm looking over the account*) So I just called in and had my mother's services bundled, and I need help getting her service working because our WiFi modem isn't working now. I only have service in my room from a cable.

*Pulled up the order, can't see where a second modem was decommissioned. It appears internet service was started from a phone-only account.*

VK: Did you have a different ISP before you called in today?

AS: No. Hey, let me call my mom and you can talk to both of us.

*AS puts me on hold and dials in his mom. I'm conferenced in after they'd already been talking for a few minutes.*

EM: - I want my \*bleep\* to work NOW, AS. I don't care what you have to do. Let this girl help you!

AS: (suddenly very static-y) what.... can't...I'll call back later. Bye.

**- 1st call ends -**

I immediately go into after-call because my interest is piqued. From what I was able to tell, they had phone only until today, when they had HSD activated. Their device was a combination phone/ wired cable modem, so it wouldn't have working WiFi on it's own. At this point I suspect they had another ISP that one of them cancelled before we started talking, hence the suddenly non-working WiFi. I left notes on the account about what I found and carry on with my day.

**Call 2**

Fast forward an hour or so: we're pretty slow, so I'm reading a book when my neighbor OT gets a call. I'm not really paying attention, but I can hear what she's saying. She gets done with the call with a weird look on her face, and tells me ""I just had your customer"", and relayed this story:

OT:  {$GenericTechSupportIntro}

AS: My WiFi isn't working.

*OT pulls the account, reads my notes, attempts to verify my findings with AS.*

AS: I didn't have another ISP! Just help me fix this!

*OT tries to walk AS through basic troubleshooting: powercycle, bypass router, ect) Just like before, WiFi not working, able to surf through wired connection.*

OT: OK, so it looks at this point like your router is not working properly.

AS: That's what I thought. I'll fix it on my own.

\**click*\*

**- 2nd call ends -**

**Call 3**

Fast forward another couple hours, and I get a call. This time it's a woman on the line.

VK: {$GenericTechSupportIntro}

EM: Hello, I had my internet turned on this afternoon and we need help getting it set up.

VK: I'll be happy to help, lets pull up your account...

*Pulled up account. Immediately recognize the account. I see my previous notes as well as OT's.*

VK: Ah, okay, I remember speaking with your son earlier today. Is he still having trouble setting things up with that wired modem?  (*hint hint, y'all*)

EM: Yeah, and I need this working because I work from home.

VK: Are you home right now?

EM: No, let me call my son and we'll all talk about it.

*AS comes on the line, EM doesn't tell him I'm there, and immediately starts yelling at him.  I don't mean ""I'm frustrated"" yelling, I mean full on calling her son everything but a Child of God. I almost hung up but... it wasn't abuse directed at me, so I would have gotten dinged on it by QA.*

EM: - now, this girl is going to help you.

AS: I told you, mom, I don't need her help. I just need help here, but no one will do what I tell them!

EM: Well maybe we need them to send someone out?

AS: NO. DO NOT DO THAT. I CAN FIX THIS MYSELF.

*More profanity from both ends. Wish I'd made popcorn on my last break about now.*

EM: Don't act like that, I had this girl on the line here and now she's gone.

VK: No ma'am, I'm still here.

EM: See? She's still trying to help you.

AS: \*beep\* I don't need any \*beep\* help. I told you I CAN FIX THIS MY \*BEEEEEEEEEEEP\* SELF!

And the call drops.

**- 3rd call ends -**

We had the answer following my first time speaking with these people. At this point we're 0/3 trying to get the point across to these people.

Like I said before, I'll be checking out that account on Monday. I'm curious if they actually let us help them resolve this.

Edit: formatting. I lurk more than I post, so some things come out messy. 




-Update-
Eventually someone sent a tech out for these people,  wherein the plot thickened. It was determined that most of my troubleshooting was right. Also,  when the tech went out he found they were running a business on a residential account. He found the other ISP's modem and our wired one and explained to them the issue was not actually with their service through us. 
EM tried to call back in later to complain to a manager about the tech not fixing the problem, and managed to get the field tech sup and the next higher sup involved. All managers tell her to stop calling and wasting people's time.  Also that she had x number of days to transfer to a biz account or have her account disconnected.

90,My Hotel Wifi,"Some 40 odd moon cycle's ago I was working for a regional paper and providing service desk report and one call has always stuck.

Me: Welcome to helpdesk, how can I assist? 

Kath: Hi, I'm at *conference hotel* and I can't connect to *my* wifi.

Me: OK that's usually a simple thing can you check that the adaptor hasn't been disabled (I describe the switch and talk them through it) can you connect now. 

Kath: No, now I can't see any network.

Me: OK, so just repeat what we just did, can you see the networks available now? 

Kath: Yes, but I can't get connected still it says no internet.

Me: OK so you are connected to a network, but its saying no internet, can I get you to try the following (talk through ipconfig, flushdns etc) hmm, no IP address eh? that is very strange. Lets try reconnecting from scratch, can you disconnect and reconnect entering the key the hotel provided. 

Kath: What key? 

Me: The hotels wifi key, they should have provided you with one to access their wifi. 

Kath: I'm not trying to connect to the hotel wifi, I'm trying to connect to *my* wifi!

Me: *incredibly confused* Your wifi?

Kath: yes. 

Me: How are you even seeing your wifi if you are in a hotel? 

Kath: I've brought by router with me unplugged the room phone and connected it up like it should be and I just want to get on the internet!

Me: *somewhere between speechless and kinda impressed with the logic* umm, I'm sorry that's not going to work, that router will only work with your home phone line, you'll have to get the hotels details and use them. 

Kath: *grumbling* what a con, so I have to pay them to access their wifi? ridiculous. *hangs up phone*

92,Password incorrect?

Part of this process involves getting the computer name and making sure it matches the asset tag. Most people have been friendly, but there is always that one person.

This lady was not happy that I was not there to fix her computer problems. I explained that at the moment I am just doing a detailed inventory but once that is done a support contract will be created and I’ll be able to help her. Right now all I need is for her to step away so I can read that asset tag and verify the computer name, I do not need her to do anything and I will not be signing her out or restarting the computer as I can get everything I need from the login screen.

Because she has the computer locked I do the needful and click on “Switch User” so I can see the computer name. Please note I did not sign her out, or sign myself in. I then clicked on her user icon so she can unlock the computer without having to do anything other than type her password. Mistakenly thinking that all is well I move on to the next computer.

The case of the missing emails. 

*The sounds of a smooth jazz saxaphone plays in your ears as the scene fades in.*

It was a hot summer afternoon in Texas. The sun was beating in through the windows as my little desk fan lazily spun around making a squeak each pass. The air it moved offered only a tiny respite from the heat and boredome. It was the kind of day where all I could do was sit there and sweat while I waited for the next case to hit my desk. 

I reached into my desk and grabbed a bottle and a glass. Two ice cubes from my mini fridge go in and I pour myself a drink. As I was halfway through my liquid bliss a voice pierced the silence. ""Got one of those for me?"" The voice belonged Nancy, one of the ladies down the hall from accounting. The look on her face and the furrow in her brow told me all was not right in her world. 

I silently pulled another glass out and fixed her the same drink. ""Go ahead and take a seat. Tell me your troubles Nancy."" 

Nancy sat down on the other side and quickly gulped down her drink.  With the bottle at the ready, I poured her another glass of Mountain Dew. ""One more to calm your nerves."" With her hand shaking she gulped this glass down too. ""Thanks. They say you are the best at finding things are lost."" She said as her hands would not stop fidgeting. 

""Well that depends on what went missing nancy. I am excellent at finding some things like password, but others like people or love I just have no luck in."" I said in a sort of self depracating humor. 

""Heh. Thanks. I sent a business associate an email two weeks ago from a loaner unit. For some reason no one is able to find these emails and they are not showing up in my sent list."" As she spoke her hands shook and her voice started cracking. 

I reached into my pack and pulled out a stick of gum handing it to her. She quickly took it started chewing. The temporary relief provided by the gum did its job and allowed her to calm down. ""A few emails are nothing to lose your head over Nancy. There will always be more."" I said as I poured myself another glass. 

""I don't think you fully understand.  These emails are vital. I was working on a deal worth half a million and now things are going south. If I can't find these emails, I am done. You hear me? DONE!"" A small whistle escaped my lips. ""Well then I guess we better get started."" I said as I grabbed my hat and coat. ""We better visit the loaner room and find the unit you were working on."" I said as I held open the door to my office. 

The lack of employees at their desks were a strange sight as we rounded the corner leading to the loaner clost. As we approached the loaner storage, I immediately knew something was amiss. Several people were gathered around the doorway with their faces all eager to see the carnage inside as they forced themselves onto the tips of their toes. This kind of crowd only gathers for one thing.   

We parted our way through the crowd to see three other techs staring at a dead laptop on the ground. ""What have we got here Bobby?"" I asked causing one of them to stand up and hand me the laptop. ""Its dead. Coffee spilled on the keyoard."" Bobby said with his face clearly expressing displeasure. ""Folgers cofee by the smell of it"" I said taking a wiff. ""I see someone else enjoys the finer things in life."" Bobby said in retort. ""Can't start my day without a good cup of Joe."" 

I motion for nancy to come in. ""Is this the laptop you used to send the emails?"" I asked her flatly. ""Y-yes that is it. Can you recover them?"" She asked with an overly eager tone. The depseration in her voice and the sweat on her brow let everyone in the room know that she was scared. ""Well the Hard drive appears to be intact. Whoever tried to kill this laptop clearly did a poor job of it. All I have to do is swap hard drives and have you log in."" I say causing her to smile with glee. ""Hey Bobby hand me another unit. I am going to try my hand at a simple swap for Nancy here."" Bobby grimaced by understood that I would get a laptop one way or another and just handed me it. ""Bring it back in an hour you hear me. One hour."" 

With a wave of my hand acknowledging the request from Bobby, me and Nancy were off back to my office. Once we were back in I had Nancy hand me a small black case off of the desk. With all too much practice I removed the back of the laptop and unhooked the hard drive from the dead unit. ""We are in luck, the coffee did not make it this far back."" I said as I swapped it into a working unit. 

I opened it up and started the machine telling Nancy to log in. She sat down on the other side of the desk from me and slowly but surely her smile faded into the same worried expression that she had when she first came to me. ""Th-they are not here!?"" She asked to no one and me at the same time. ""What do you mean Nancy? What's wrong?"" I asked trying to calm her down. ""The emails are not here... they have been deleted.""",False,353,66,TheLightningCount1,talesfromtechsupport

I pointed at the screen and probably looked a little bit sheepish.

Me: There is your problem.

At this point, I have to mention that my gf's english is not good. She just saw the word paper and did the first thing she thought was right.

GF: There was paper in it and I put some more in. That is not the problem!

Me: But the wrong size.

GF: what do you mean? We only have A4 (default letter size here)! And I printed as I allways do!

Me: And why does the printer requests Legal?

Gf: It wanted paper, I gave him paper. What's wrong with it?

Me: Yes, it wants Legal paper!

Gf: Why does it want legal paper? (noted that I haven't capitalized it now? She used the german word, while I allwas pronounced it english)

Me: You know, what Legal is?

Gf: Yes, it's english for legal. Allowed, or what ever.

I had a brief look at her screen, while she was typing that letter. All the labels for the fields to fill in her adress were in english.

I pointed at her desk.

Me: May I?

She nodded with a glare of anger in her eyes.

I got to the pageformatting and look there, the template was formatted as Legal.

Hey y’all, long time lurker, first time poster. I know most people in the subreddit are tech savvy, but I’ll still try to provide explanations on anything that might cause confusion to the average end user. 

I’ll provide some backstory real quick. I have a degree in Net/Sys Admin with an emphasis on Cisco Routing and Switching, plus I’m in the last year of my cybersec AAS. Not to mention several certs. I got hired on at an MSP as a Network Engineer a couple months ago. First part of this interaction is shortly after I started.

[product support] couldn’t even begin to guess what he had done. I’ll save you all the technical stuff. [product support] keeps escalating us to different departments, different tiers, different continents (joking...ish). It’s been about three weeks at this point that we’ve been working with them with no end in sight. 

C calls in. 

M: thank you for call [company], my name is [m].”

C: give me [coworker]

M: he’s out of town, is there something I can help you with?

C, condescendingly: I don’t think you can sweetie. I need tech support. 

M: oh, that’s me! I’m the newest edition to the Help Desk. 

C, same tone: I need one of the men to handle it. I’ve been having issues for weeks with [product] and honestly one more person isn’t going to fix it. 

M: I can give you the most recent update from working with [product support] if you’ll let me pull it up. 

C, again being a punk: sweetheart, I doubt you can help me. Do you even have a tech degree? I’ll call later. 

And he ends the call and sends a particularly demeaning email to my CEO that my CEO forwarded onto our help desk team. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. Our service coordinator has been delegating C’s issued to other engineers (5 of us total) after that, but today I was the only one available, so he transfers him to me.

C calls in again with guess what! [product] issues. 

M, feeling dread: thank you for call [company] blah blah blah

C, sheepishly: hi [m] I goofed, can you help me?

M, remembering all my customer service rapport building tricks from the days were bad CSAT could get me fired even if it was out of my control: gladly, I’m so good at fixing goofs, they even pay me for it. 

C genuinely laughs and I remote into his computer, restore 30 documents he accidentally deleted and removed some adware that had been bothering him for weeks that he couldn’t figure out how to get rid of. 

During the time, I found out he’s a pretty decent guy, has a cabin a few miles from from the tiny mountain town I grew up in and he loves my Uncle’a cooking (owns a restaurant in said town). He’s just a d*ck when he’s stressed. Which not okay to take it out on me, but I get it, I’ve dealt with worse. I worked tech support for [satellite-tv company]. 

After the call, I popped into my CEO’s office to let him know that I’d gotten onto the right foot with him. I then learned that my CEO had responded to him letting him know that he needed to treat his employees with respect or we would be reconsidering our contract with him.


Tl;Dr: end user/CEO of a company we manage the IT for is a punk to me the first time for not being one of the men (I’m female) and not having a degree (I have one and another one I’m finishing after 6 more classes that I start on Monday). then my CEO whips him into shape and we build a decent relationship afterwards. 

Edit: CSAT is customer satisfaction. A worthless metric that doesn’t help call center agents succeed. You can get a bad CSAT survey because the sky is blue and the customer wants it to be green.

A couple of days ago, a Pain In The Arse (Hereby known as PITA) was transferred to one of our smaller service centres, and the guy who was at this small service centre has been transferred to PITA’s dealership. Neither of them were happy about this, especially PITA.  He’s been complaining from day one.


Today, the phone rang.  One look at the Caller ID, and my heart sinks.

Scoldog: “Hello, this is Scoldog speaking”

PITA: “My EFTPOS machine doesn’t work”

SD: “What?”

PITA: “My EFTPOS machine doesn’t work.  It comes up with a connection error”


About a year ago, all our branch EFTPOS machines were upgraded by the bank.  They all work on the mobile network, which is provided as part of the machine rental from the bank. There is no need for a phone line anymore like our older units.  The only thing the branch supplies is the power to run them.


SD: “We don’t deal with EFTPOS machines.  You’ll need to speak to the bank.  Call Accounts if you have to”.

PITA: “I’ve spoken to the bank, they reckon there’s something wrong with our network.”

SD: “What?  These machines aren’t on our network, they don’t touch our network in anyway.  They use the mobile phone network and the bank looks after that.”

PITA: “They say it’s something on our network stopping it from connecting”.

SD: “That is impossible”

PITA: “But its not connecting still.  There's a problem with our network!”


Whatever, I work at Head Office with the Accounts Team, so I wandered over to the Accounts Manager to ask about this.


SD: “Hey AM, can you look up the details for &lt;BRANCH&gt; EFTPOS machine?  PITA reckons it’s not working and the bank told him it’s our fault”

AM: “What’s happening with it?”

SD: “It’s coming up with a BLAHBLAHBLAH error.”

AM: “&lt;OTHERBRANCH&gt; had that same error last week with their machine.  The bank had to replace it.”


SD: “WTF?  Why did they tell him it was a problem on our side?”
AM: “Dunno.  I’ll call him and get the machine details so I can call the bank”.


AM calls PITA with me listening in the background.


AM: “Hello, PITA?  What’s wrong with your EFTPOS machine? Uhuh, uhuh……uhuh…….uhuh, OK can you get the machine and read the following details”


AM gets some information, hangs up and turns to me


AM: “Apparently his machine hasn’t been working since yesterday. The bank got him to reset it yesterday afternoon, and that got it working again until he came in this morning. It’s gone bad again.  It’s the same issue &lt;OTHERBRANCH&gt; had last week.  I’ll organise the bank to get it replaced.

SD:  “WHAT!”

So a bunch of clueless bank techs tell this guy that the issue is with our network somehow even though they should have known there is no connection between our infrastructure and their machine, and they’ve also experienced this same issue at our other branch.  PITA for some reason believed them even though he had it up and running after speaking to them the first time and wants to argue with me about our infrastructure. A bunch of people who deal with our money bugger up and a guy who is supposed to service cars who can’t seem to diagnose issues.

99,A quick and easy fix,"Long time lurker, First time poster...

Here is my first contribution to this fantastic subreddit (And maybe not the last)

(Disclaimer : English is not my first language. So I hope it will be understandable)

Let's go !

A tale about a disillusioned young IT tech, a twisted computer and an evil printer...

This story takes place a week ago... Last Monday. Somewhere in France.

In a small/medium size company, supplier in clothing for large retailers.

The IT desk is small. We are two (And soon only one. My contract should end in a few months.) :

Me, a junior IT tech which is currently in is 15th month in this fantastic company with a temporary contract, and has been losing is sanity since my first day in this company.

My boss, friend of a friend (thats how I get the job), which have lose his sanity a year before I signed my contract. Not present in this story.

Let's jump in.

It's monday, I am alone in IT lair.

Hopefully, most of the pests are on vacation. So everything is calm.

No angry user. No burning computer. Nothing.

Great ! Time for coffee !

*\*Fate decided it was not time for coffee\**

Phone is ringing.

It's shipment service.

They can't print on their computer.

Ok. Should be easy.

Quick and easy.

This computer does not belong to my company. It's the property of a haulier. But well. It's just a printer problem. A printer that belong to us. So nothing to do with the haulier.

I head to the desk and ask for the problem.

So... The problem is simple. They send documents to the printer in the warehouse office (which is located nearly 10 meters away) but nothing gets out.

No error message... Nothing.

Printer is shown online.

I look at the printing queue and...

Nearly 50 print job in queue... Some have been sent 4 months ago !

With the mighty power of the right-click, I delete the queue and retry.

Still nothing... Has expected.

I just try to send a print job on another printer (which is also 10 meters away in the same office).

It works.

So maybe... The printer is faulty ?

Turn the printer off and on again.

Same for the computer.

Retry.

Nothing.

I try from another computer.

Works fine.

So... Should be the computer.

Let's just reinstall the printer on it. Easy fix.

...

If it was so easy, why would I wrote a TFTS story ?

But I didn't knew at this moment, that this computer was twisted.

I delete the printer.

Right-click, add new printer.

I look on the list for the right one.

It appears twice. Crap.

Oh ! Nevermind. It's two differents printers. But it show me its MAC adress, so I can find the right one with this info.

I head back to the printer. Print network setting.

Found IPV6, head back to the computer.

Choose the right one.

Expect my coffee soon.

&gt; Can't install the device.  
&gt;  
&gt; No driver found

I sight.

Well... I just need to download the drivers. Quick and easy.

I download lastest the driver from manufacturer's website.

Extract them.

Manual install.

&gt;No driver found.

What ?

Ok... Let's try another one.

&gt;No driver found.

Another one ?

&gt;No driver found.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me : What are you playing... You fool ! How do you dare wasting my time, you pesky computer ?!

I download the ""Universal printer driver"" (Still from the manufacturer's website).

It says ""Universal""... So it should works, right ?

2 executables.

Double click on the 64 bits one.

&gt;Uncompatible hardware.

I froze.

&gt;$Me : Did...  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me : No...  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;$Me : It can't be...

&gt;  
&gt;$Me : It can't be that !  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me : I can't be so dumb !

I slowly move the cursor to ""This Computer"" and go to the properties...

&gt;OS : Win7 32 bits

***\*Head meets desk\****

I go back the the manufacturer website.

I click on the OS list.

I change the selection from ""Win7"" to ""Win7 32 bits""

Download.

Extract.

Install.

It works.

I head back to my office...Not proud...

That ""Quick and easy fix"" took me nearly 40 minutes...

And I now have a deathwish against peoples who install 32 bits system in 2018.

Morality ?

Always check the version of the system...

100,The South Side Specials,"TLDR:  A parts interpreter completely forgot her previous four years of experience with a particular program she uses daily


I work a large car dealership


We have a large Parts Dept shipping millions of dollars of parts all over Australia daily.  Recently I’ve been upgrading some of the computers for the parts interpreters lately as their existing computers were getting sluggish (Windows bloat).  This has caused some teething issues (among which, trying to find a version of JRE that works with 15 different parts programs without issue.  Settled on Java 1.7_25.)


Among the other problems I’ve been having are all the different parts programs shopping lists. The parts program shopping list is exactly like a website shopping list, allowing you to build up a large amount of items.  In a parts program shopping list however, there is a button that exports all the selected items to our sales system, either via creating a file and importing it, or by entering the data directly into our sales system (depends on the manufacturer).


Anyhoo, it’s after lunch on a Friday.  Read-Only time for the IT Dept.  I decided to go get a cuppa from the lunchroom.  On my way back to my desk, I was collared by one of the Parts Advisors that received an upgraded computer a couple of days ago.  Trying to work on the various issues on her computer has been trying due to her being too busy most of the time to be able to sit down with me and show me the issues she was having.  I’d look at her computer after she leaves for the day and everything would be fine.


Parts Advisor: “Scoldog, I’ve got an issue with &amp;lt;BRAND&gt; Parts program.

Scoldog: “What’s happening?”

PA: “It doesn’t transfer the quantities”

SD: “What, no data is getting into our sales system?”

PA: “No, the parts get imported, it’s just not transferring the amounts correctly.  It only transfers one of each”


OK, this is bizarre, if there is a fault with the transfer side of things, usually no data would get transferred.  I’ve never heard of any of them transferring incorrect data.


SD: “OK, show me”.


PA selects a VIN that she was previously looking up.  She had to pick out a bumper bar.  With these parts programs, they normally flag all parts that would be required for fitting a particular item.  For instance, this bumper bar requires 12 screws as well to be fitted correctly.  The person fitting it may desire to reuse the screws from the old bumper and may not require the extra parts.  The parts program automatically flags the part number for those screws in the shopping list, but not the quantity needed.  It’s up to the advisor to enter in the quantity, or zero them out as required.


PA:  “Ok, so I’ve selected this bumper bar, there are all the parts, and LOOK! The sales system has only imported 1 of every item!”


I look at the parts program shopping list, every item selected in the parts program list has a 1 in the Quantity field.


SD: “You’ve only selected 1 of each item in the shopping list.  Look there at the Qty field.”

PA: “No, that’s not correct.  It should automatically calculate how many screws I need for this bumper.”

SD:  “Why would it do that?”

PA: “Look over here.” *points to 'Qty required' field* “It says I need 12, and it should automatically put 12 in the Qty field”

SD: “Sorry, I don’t think that is the way it works.  It might say 12 screws are required, but it only puts 1 in the Qty field.  You will need to modify the Qty yourself.”

PA: “But it used to!”

SD: “What?”

PA: “It used to automatically enter the amount needed in the old program”

The parts program she is currently using is the exact same version she was using on her old computer.  Installed from the same DVD.  She’s used this same program for the four years it’s been since she has started with the company.

SD: “To be honest, that doesn’t sound right.  How does the program know exactly how many you may or may not need?”

PA: “But &amp;lt;TOPBLOKE&gt; computer automatically does it!”

&amp;lt;TOPBLOKE&gt; is another parts interpreter in Parts.  He normally helps IT out by fielding some of the questions his colleagues have, and knows when to approach IT.  If he says there is a problem, there is a guaranteed problem that needs fixing.  He doesn’t have an upgraded computer yet either. His desk is on the North side of the office, PA is on the South Side.  It’s a running joke amongst the Northerners in Parts  that the South Side is Special.

SD: “TB is running the exact same program you are running and the exact same version.  It should work the same for all off you.”

PA: “OK, I’ll show you.”

She emails the car VIN over to TB with the associated part numbers she needs to pick.  I follow PA over to TB’s desk.

PA: “TB, can you look up that VIN that I emailed you and pick the parts I requested”

TB: “Sure”

SD: “Do you mind explaining to me each step as you do it?""

TB: “Yeah, no problems”


TB loads up his parts program, and away he goes


TB:  “Ok, so you are after this bumper bar.  Ok, so I select the bumper bar there, there’s the associated parts, then I change the Qty of the screws to 12 and transfer it to the sales system, and all done!”

SD: “Ok, so when you first select the parts, the parts quantities are all set to 1 in your parts program”

TB: “Yes”

SD: “And you manually change the quantities you need in the quantity field”

TB: “Yes, or I delete or zero it out as needed.  That’s the way it’s always worked.

PA: “…………Oh”

PA wanders back to her desk in a haze of bewilderment.

SD: “Thanks TB”

TB: “No worries Scoldog.  You know I don’t mind helping you out with those South Siders whenever they need help!”

Background : My company does 3rd party IT support for all sorts of business, for this client we do mainly tier 1 and 2 and some on-site service calls at their retail stores (anything more, or if it's at their HQ, and it's their own IT that takes care of it). I do many things at my company, and that includes call center duties, so enough of explanations and onto this simple, yet funny (but tame) story!

ME = ... well, me!

AM = Assistant Manager

&gt;ME : \**mandatory greeting and questions\**   
&gt;  
&gt;AM : Hi, this is AM from store 123. Seems like the store email isn't working anymore!   
&gt;  
&gt;ME : No problem, what's the error you're getting?   
&gt;  
&gt;AM : Not getting any errors, but when I open it, it's not showing the email like usual...   
&gt;  
&gt;ME : Ok. What does it looks like now? (they use Outlook, so I'm expecting her to be in the calendar or something similar)   
&gt;  
&gt;AM : Well, like ... not like it's supposed to!   
&gt;  
&gt;ME : Right, so did you get an error when opening Outlook?   
&gt;  
&gt;AM : No, I'm going through the web portal!

While they normally use Outlook, they also have the option to use a web portal. Practical if they are not on the manager's computer (like one of the retail computer in front) or on their phones.

&gt;ME : Ah! I see, and where are you trying to connect from? One of the retail PC, or your phone?   
&gt;  
&gt;AM : No the manager's PC.   
&gt;  
&gt;ME : ...   
&gt;  
&gt;ME : You could use Outlook instead of the web portal.   
&gt;  
&gt;AM : Yes, but I prefer the web portal!

Fair enough, plus there might be a problem we need to fix and I have to confirm what the problem is. So there a bit of back and forth, to know when was the last time it worked, to try to understand what she sees, if she's entering the correct address (WEBPORTAL.STORE.COM) etc. But it's an older lady and she's extremely vague, she isn't helpful in her explanation and simply repeat that 'it used to work"" ...

So at this point I remote into the manager's PC to see what's up.

&gt;ME : AH! I see the problem! You have to type the address in the top bar, not search for it in Google ...   
&gt;  
&gt;AM : Oh?

So yeah, she was SEARCHING for WEBPORTAL.STORE.COM, instead of typing it in the address bar (a quick look in the history showed she actually went to Google.com, and then searched).

Took me less than a minute and she had a desktop shortcut and a favorite. I also explained to her that when she wants to go to a website (especially if she has the complete address), she has to type the address in the URL zone, not search it with Google, still unsure if she understood!

I wander over to her computer, and attempt to right click, not looking at her second monitor. I get the task manager up and notice it is being sluggish. I check up-time, 7 days. That's normal, shouldn't cause these problems. 

Then i look at her second screen.

It is a chrome browser, and the task manager tells me she has 120 Tabs open. I have never seen 120 Tabs on anything before. I close chrome, and problem is sorted. I tell her that she had a lot of pages open. ""Well i need the tabs for my shopping""

We made nice presentation and they loved it. There were some issues with ms project and some questions about licensing they had to take care of before we get a final GO so we had to refer to Suzan as the contact to this move.

I had to order 2 servers: file and backup (part of the project) to be installed. I already submitted to Suzan our work-plan and it was approved. We just needed 50% deposit and credit card no so we could start opening accounts etc..

2 weeks goes by and nothing. I contacted Suzan; they are busy right now. 1 week later: same thing. 1 more week and I call her explaining that the project that was expected to start during construction holidays (2 weeks here in canada) it's in jeopardy because we wont have enough time to get stuff delivered and tested beforehand.

At that time I worked in a store for a network company where I mostly did the tech support for customers.

Someday this girl (16-ish) came to the store with her friend.

A few settings where off on her phone and she needed some advise on how to set them, kinda basic stuff for me.

So I start explaining the settings and advised her about some extra apps she could use when her phone starts ringing.

She answered the call and I heard a lot of ""can you repeat it"" and ""I can't hear you"".

After the call I asked why she had issue's hearing people and her friend kicked in by explaining she could barely hear anyone since she had the phone. They already spoken to a few tech-savy friends, family members and even went to the genius bar of the manufacturer. No-one could solve the issue and the ""genius"" told her to arrange a replace but since it wasn't bought in their store she had to go to the store she bought it and ask a new phone based upon warranty.

She received the phone for her birthday a few months ago and still hadn't time to go to that shop with her father (contract was on his name so he had to be present for that).

Since her initial issue was so basic I didn't really looked at the phone but just went through the settings and now it made me look closer at the phone. I already noticed she had a screenprotector but now looking better at it I saw that instead of using a new one she cut of the lower part of the original screenprotector.

And as some of you might already envision.....the screenprotector went over the screen into the back. Covering the earpiece. So I took it off and asked her to call her friend and listen how she sounded.

$gf just bought $newlaptop for university, a quite powerful machine which $Ygg would eventually borrow a few times for important ~~LAN-parties~~ field studies.  
Well since $gf could get Windows 7 and $demandingsoftware via university, she ordered $newlaptop with no Windows7 installed to save a few bucks.

Having received her $newlaptop she now tried to install Windows 7 on it and the following situation ensued:*

&gt;$gf: Hey $Ygg, so i uhh downloaded Windows 7 and put it on DVD to install on $newlaptop but it nothing happens when i insert the DVD.  
&gt;$Ygg (optimistic): Okay sure, i'll have a look...

Thinking that its probably just the wrong boot sequence, $Ygg had a look at the BIOS and surely enough there i found the DVD and put it in first place.  
After saving changes, he rebooted confidently just to witness...nothing loading aside from the BIOS which cycled through the boot sequence happily proclaiming ""no bootable device"".

&gt;$Ygg: Well, that's odd...you did put Windows 7 on the DVD right? How did you do it? Did you properly burn the file to DVD?  
&gt;$gf (shouting from another room): I think so, but i can show you how i did it - i followed instructions for (reading out loud) ""creating a bootable Windows Installation Disk""  

$Ygg came over, and sure enough her process seemed legit, she selected the right partition scheme, file system etc.  

&gt;$gf: Is $newlaptop already broken? Do i have to send it back? I dont want to work on my old potato anymore, and i cant run half the $demandingsoftware i need   
&gt;$Ygg (impressed by $gf's sudden spurt of tech-savvyness): Hrmmm...no i don't think so...but i'll see if i can boot up the DVD on my PC...  

$Ygg actually had to plug a CD/DVD Drive in his PC first, since he had not used CDs in ages, but once that was done he saw, that he as well was unable to boot from the DVD.
Deciding to just create a bootable flash drive on his own, he launched his own *working* version of windows and after logging in, noticed a notification about a new external device connected to the PC
Interested in the contents of the DVD $Ygg opened to drive to see the files contained.

$Ygg blinked a few times and pushed his face closer to the monitor as he did a double take to look at the single file contained on the DVD.

    7zip.exe
	
For a few seconds $Ygg just stared at the screen, then broke out in loud laughter - ultimately attracting $gf's attention.

As it turned out, when accessing the university softwareportal she downloaded ""7zip for Windows"" mistaking it for the actual windows installation.  
Using the softwareportal himself later, $Ygg couldnt really blame $gf for that mistake - all entires were deeply nested and recommended Software (like 7zip)
popped up in large Panels everywhere, pushing the software you actually clicked on to the very bottom of the page.

In the end we were able to get everything running smoothly, including ~~$Ygg's Games for LAN~~ $demandingsoftware.
Until one day a single Windows 10 Update snuck through during exam season, but that is another story.

108,Kicking that Network,"Reading one of the stories here reminded me of a tale of Chuck Norris.

A new client was coming onboard for our internet and phone services, but decided to hire a separate company for wireless. We had already discussed and provisioned some 4 or so networks from our layer 3 switch for internal data, staff wireless, guest, phones, etc.

Some time after the internet and switching was setup we got a call to schedule a discussion with this other 3rd party company to discuss their wireless configuration. As the call begins the tech on the line introduces himself as Chuck Norris. My supervisor doesn't notice it right away and we keep discussing going over the different SSIDs they would want to configure and all for their needs. Nearing the end of the call my supervisor asks for his contact info and goes to write down his email and the guy renames himself, to which he gets a reply ""Wait are you shitting me, your name is Chuck Norris?"" And indeed it was.

Over the next few days we regularly make jokes about kicking patch cables into place and printing images of the real Chuck Norris to leave around the office thinking its all in great fun. Then the day they are supposed to deploy their wireless arrives and things quickly turn south.

Chuck Norris calls our newest employee to ask us what IPs to use and where to plugin his generic cheap switch/wireless controller by some brand I don't even recognize. They get that squared away and the switch added to the admin network and the call ends. Will he kick the APs directly into the ceiling to mount them? Deployment begins.

Sometime later he calls back saying his APs are plugged in and they aren't getting addresses. Well, they are on the admin network and we aren't controlling wireless so we have no DHCP scope setup, but we go ahead and add one for the subnet and ask if he needs a hex option or anything for the controller. ""No I've never needed anything of the sort it just works as is."" Okay then, and away he goes into the sunset.

A little while later he calls back again. The wireless is setup now, but the clients that connect don't work. Really? Well all the wired clients and DHCP scopes are setup so it should work fine? Turns out the users aren't getting DNS so they aren't getting anywhere. Because the clients are getting DHCP on the admin vlan instead of one of the client ones.

Well Chuck, you need to setup the SSIDs to match to the correct vlans so that clients in each network get placed onto the correct subnets. ""What do you mean vlans? We just setup the SSIDs and then clients connect and everything works."" It turns out they have apparently been setting up wireless networks for people with all the SSIDs always just sitting on a flat single data network and no separation.

We investigate further and screen share with him to look at this controller switch, and figure out where to go to apply vlans to SSIDs and ports. There is a catch though, we can't. The AP model they had speced and installed does not even support vlans. (On a side note, they also had 5ghz radios disabled because ""They don't need that."")

So we discuss it a bit more and they don't really have any option, so we change the handoff port to their switch to the data network, they change its management IP and put all the SSIDs (just PSKs, no user auth or anything, plus the open guest network) on the same subnet.

All of our hype and jokes lead to nothing but great disappointment and a glorious Chuck Norris network was never to be had. From what I heard he didn't even kick anything.

A week or two later we get a call from the client requesting how much a wireless quote would be and if we could get things setup correctly so staff have to login as users and guest would correctly be separated and all. Within a month everything was moved over and all signs of the previous system erased. Chuck Norris nothing but a fondly painful memory.",False,117,10,ArmSlaveArbalest,talesfromtechsupport
109,The difference between CatOS and IOS,"Some old timers might get a laugh out of this. IFU a long time ago at my first job. Not long out of school. I had interned with said company and had a decent networking knowledge and was reasonably comfortable with both IOS and CatOS. Got given a task to upgrade some older 6500s from CatOS to IOS. 

Theres a lesson here involving change control that was learned, but thats another story entirely. But regardless, one night got a partner in crime to assist and went at. 

Boot statements missing or un-resolvable on any cisco devices will default to a set of behavior. That behavior is actually quite predictable if well understood. The problem with one of these boxes is it had internal linecards, external linecards, and some really old bootrom that also had code on  it...

Starting out, I wiped the internal, had partner insert external with the IOS image. Little did I know about the internal bootrom...

To really set the scene, this switch was effectively a downstream access switch with a single uplink to 2 paired core devices. In my defense, we also found the config was wrong on the core switches, as effectively spanning tree was not enabled for these ports. 

So when we rebooted the device, I had not set a new bootstatement. First default boot location is that bootrom. Which happened to have another CatOS image. 

So my big problem, CatOS when it boots, has all ports open by default. Bad for security but great for ""it just works"" Cisco default switching. IOS doesnt do this any more (didnt then either); ports boot closed by default. 

So while Im cursing and my partner is laughing that the IOS didnt boot, his phone is ringing... Its the NOC, wondering why the whole datacenter is down...

Needless to say, got some very good lessons and memory refreshers out of this fun, and got away scott free. Probably wouldnt today, but some good booze at the end of the night cures all ills. ",False,63,2,triangleredditor,talesfromtechsupport
110,A loss of confidence...,"Sometimes the story is not about the user being dumb... it's about the tech being dumb... 

I had been working for City Hall providing Helpdesk support for some time. One of the Helpdesk had gotten a promotion and I was picked to take over some of her duties. Specifically, I was asked to start spending half days at City Court to provide Helpdesk services there. 

I spent a week or so shadowing the other technician to get to know some of the people and get a feel for the problems they might have. On my second or third day on my own, one of my users tells me that her computer won't power on. I go over to take a look and ask the user ( an older woman ) where her computer was. She promptly points at the monitor on her desk. I immediately have flashbacks to working at the bank and think ""Oh no, not again..."". I am looking on her large and crowded desk, under her desk, behind her desk, etc. for the tower. The user is watching me, and finally asks me what I'm doing. I tell her that I'm looking for the computer. She gets a funny look on her face and points at her monitor again. I'm about to tell the user that that's NOT her computer when I look over and realize that it's an all-in-one. I'm very embarrassed and now the user looks like she's ready to kick me out of her office. I pull the power cable and hit the power button a few times, plug the cable back in, and power the machine up much to the relief of the user. 

TL;DR: Users aren't always completely ignorant. Sometimes you need to stop and listen.

It's a twofor! So, back in 2002 or so... I was in the office for a few days and was helping out one of our electronics techs. He was tasked with putting together about 30 new offshore PC's. Our company used MOSTLY in house built PC's. He and I were both very familiar with building PC's and had each probably built over 100. So, we assemble these 30 machines and when we go to power them up to install the OS.... only 8 of them power up. Now, these 8 weren't all the ones he built nor all the ones I built. They were randomly distributed. We double check the cabling from the power supply to the motherboard, from the power switch to the motherboard, verify that the outlet has power... we are completely stumped. There's no way we got 22/30 motherboards that are DOA... 

While we are unplugging and replugging power cables, we \*FINALLY\* noticed that there was ALSO a power switch on the back of the power supply in addition to the front panel power switch. 22 out of 30 of the power supplies had that switch in the OFF position. We both felt like idiots... Prior to that, neither of us had run across a power supply that had a separate power switch. ",False,119,24,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport

EDIT: @PM = project manager



So, i'm working as a web developper for a company that produces an extremely niche product.

Those products come with custom labels. 
Now if you ever printed labels, you'll know you need to be very precise on the position and such. The way our web app works is that it makes a preview of the labels and allows to print the rendered html/css directly, so all positioning is html css. That in itself is a bit of a pain.

Yesterday i got assigned a ticket to add the labels for the only version of the product that doesn't share the same labels as the others to the app. You basically have to paste the whole sheet on the product and then you can break the pieces as you need it.

Being told the dimensions were on our (rarely updated) confluence, i go on my merry way. Except that when i'm done, and ask @PM an existing version of the labels to confirm it matches, IT DOESN'T. BY A LOT.

Our conclusion : confluence is screwed up, again.

Fast forward to today, nothing else can be found so I start hand mesuring the existing to make it match. After a painful process of translating cm in px and a still inaccurate result, with a brief interlude offering my kitten's blood to the printer because jammed paper broke it causing it to autojam new paper, @PM goes :

&gt; I remember the old specs were screwed up, @(other guy that broke his leg badly and haven't been here since 6 months) had to do a lot of hand tweaking to make it work

*SCREAMS INTERNALLY*

&gt; Would a sample of product before the labels are put help you match it?

**SCREAMS LOUDER**

&gt; (soft-spoken) yes please

After testing my last prints, comprehension comes to me, and I check original. IT BARELY MATCHES and same parts are actually not exactly the same making it all crooked up.

I test my first version, it fits perfectly. Turns out confluence was right all along, and we had been selling a 'fix'.

112,"It's Cisco, it just works.","A long time ago my company took on a new client, a sister company to an existing client who after hearing that we got to the bottom of of some networking issues wanted us to come in and do the same.

During our first year with them, we upgraded their mail server and file server. They very much enjoyed not having exchange information stores dismounting on a regular basis. They also enjoyed the install of ExtremeZ-IP so the mac users could access the shares on the windows server with ease and they were especially grateful that we took the time to re-label their patch cabinet which had been put in by rank amateurs as the label on the patch panel had absolutely nothing to do with the port number out on the office floor, which finally enabled us to make sure all the OSX machines were on gigabit ethernet as opposed to the 100mb ports most were on to access their 600MB+ image files. All in all things were running smoothly. the only issue we ever had was that they were a 90 minute drive away from us on a good day when they needed on site skills.

Then they got a new phone system. My company does phone systems, but they didn't go with us or even let us know they were looking. We found out when we got the out of hours call.

$PI = phone idiot

$Me = podgerama

$client = the client

$PI: Hi, i'm doing some work on the phone system at $client, there's something wrong with your network, it doesnt work properly.

$Me: Pardon?

$PI: Yeah the phones aren't getting IP addresses, there is something wrong on your network mate!

$Me: Sorry, who are you and what work are you doing?

$PI: I work for (can't remember company name) and we are replacing their old Avaya phone system with a new Mitel one this weekend, but i've plugged all my kit in place and nothing gets an IP and now none of the computers which go into the back of the new phones get out to the internet. and now, all the computers that were plugged direct in to the walls don't even get an address.

$Me: okay, i was totally unaware of this work going on, and the last time i did some work on their network was on Wednesday and everything was connected and i had access to all VLAN's

$PI: well mate, somethings gone wrong and I cant complete my work until your lot fix this.

$Me: \*checks monitoring system\* OK, i can see everything was up and working until 10:30 this morning, have you changed anything apart from the phone system?

$PI: no mate, i just started the install around then.

$Me: O.K. can you do a check for me, in the rack there should be a 48 Port HP Procurve switch, what are the lights doing on there.

$PI: That's doing nothing, I've replaced it with a Cisco!

$Me: Pardon? errm, what?

$PI: yes mate, replaced it with a better switch, this one's a Cisco.

(he gave the model number, it wasn't even a catalyst, it was a horrible budget re-branded Linksys)

$Me: And there is your fault, what you have done is remove the core switch, with the VLAN's configured on it and replaced it with an unconfigured switch. Do you even know the VLAN ID's that were supposed to be programmed onto that?

$PI: What's a VLAN? anyway, this shouldn't be a problem, its a Cisco Switch, they just work!

$Me: excuse me? could you repeat that?

$PI: its a Cisco, they just work!

$Me: No, the bit before that!

$PI: what?

$Me: the part where you asked what a VLAN was?

$PI: I don't need to know about those, the Cisco switch can do all of that!

$Me: So you are telling me you have replaced the fully configured HP procurve switch, which has ports configured with LACP for extra server bandwidth, and VLAN trunks to separate the phone and data networks with a re-branded Linksys and you are wondering why there is no network connectivity.

$PI: I don't normally have to do any switch config because these Cisco's just work.

$Me: listen, mate, you have clearly just walked and started messing with a network that is well above your pay grade. If you don't know or understand what a VLAN is then you don't have the required knowledge to be reconfiguring this network.

$PI: so what do i do, i told them i would only be an hour and its been three.

$Me: you abandon your install, you give me your email address, i send you a photo of the HP switch as it was two weeks ago and my excel spreadsheet of what cable was plugged in where and you plug that all back in as it was before you started at 10:30 this morning. Because of this conversation the call status has changed from out of hours emergency fix to Chargeable out of hours engineering, the bill for this is £250/hour so i don't think you are going to want me to be online for much longer.

$PI: so what do i tell the client?

$Me: i've already started mailing them and i'm attaching this call recording. This was the first my company has heard of the job and your company has not made any contact with us before about this to arrange out of hours support, and from our conversation someone with the requisite skill set was not sent. I would suggest you inform them that the network is more complex than you initially thought and further contact with my company is required to be able to preconfigure your equipment so this job can work.

$PI: err, ok, err, thanks

Anyway. he gets the original stuff patched back in and we hear nothing from them. They sent someone with more of a brain two weeks later who used the network diagram we provided to the client to work things out. I say a bit more of a brain, but not a genius. We got calls from the client the next week after the phone installs, all the Macs in the design department were running slowly and it must be our fault. After a support call to us it turned out the phone boys had patched them into the back of the new phones taking them down to 100mb connections. I proved this by showing the status page of the HP switch now with only 1/4 of its ports active.

The client called the phone people out to re-patch

The phone people patched them directly into wall sockets to the horrible Linksys/Cisco and charged the client for doing so.

The macs showed 1Gb connecetions but were still slow over the network, the phone people said it was our problem. much back and forth later with the client getting more pissed off and the phone people blaming our network i decided to pop in.

The answer was staring me in the face with a big orange light. they had configured the port used to link the Cisco/Linksys into the HP as 100mb. I showed them by plugging my laptop into the HP - 1000mb, then into the Linksys - 100mb. which turned all of this from free of charge break fix engineering into chargeable work.

The last i heard the client were tearing the phone company a new one for their incompetence, lack of understanding, for the amount of time wasted by the design department and for the £2K of billing from my company to fix their mistakes.

TL;DR - idiot with no networking knowldge and a big bag full of assumptions breaks network after thinking Cisco label will make everything magically work

You may remember me from such TFTS classics as ***[The customer who did not want a tech](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3op1yo/the_customer_who_did_not_want_a_tech/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)*** and [***Grow up and fix it yourself***](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1bkoq0/grow_up_and_fix_it_yourself/)

Today though I'm here to talk about ***field technicians***. The ones that come into your home to install things or fix things!...in theory

So. A little background to this story. The VERY LARGE CABLE COMPANY I worked for used to have a system where field techs would have to call an outsourcing company every time they needed something altered or something was broken or anything else they couldn't ""do"" on their own

Unsurprisingly, these outsourcers were ***god awful*** and never did their jobs. Oh and there was a different one for every single state, so all the training manuals, procedures etc were different for every state. And there's something like 30+ states serviced. Absolutely ***perfect***

So eventually they took an entire building and reassigned about 250 of us to handle being this brand new department. Basically a ""Tier 2 support line"" for field techs

Field techs and contractors immediately abused our new department with absolute gleeful malice. This is the first in a likely long line of stories about these things happening

____


We start this story, as all great stories do, with me receiving a phone call. A contractor down in Texas was on a job. He was to 

1. Install a cable box for the customer

2. Upgrade their old DOCSIS 2 modem to a brand new all in one modem/router combo 

So far so simple. The contractor had installed and provisioned the new modem and the signal levels were excellent. He probably just needs something like the box serial number added to the account. Easy 

His problem however (or so he claimed) was that the customer ""wouldn't let him"" run a new cable line to the living room for their cable TV! 

""Oh boy, I know where this is going"" I winced internally

Immediately, as contractors so often do. He asks if I will speak to the customer and ""explain"" why this is needed. I politely, but firmly, inform him that we ***do not speak to customers under any circumstances***. 

Undeterred by this, he puts his work phone down, putting me on speaker. He then pulls out his backup work phone, dials the customer and puts her on speaker phone. Putting both phones on the table side by side!

I quickly repeated my statement that we do not speak to customers, requested to be taken off speaker phone and muted my microphone. I then proceeded to listen to the customer and the contractor debate the issue.


As it turns out. The customer already ***had*** a cable outlet in that location. They previously had Satellite TV (DirecTV/Dish/Whomever). All the contractor would have to do is cut the cable outside and patch it into the existing line from us!

She knew this, the contractor knew this, and he could not formulate a convincing argument to convince her otherwise.



___

I should probably mention that contractors for VERY LARGE CABLE COMPANY earn commission on certain kinds of work done. In this case, if the installer ran a new cable line. He would have earned $15. The customer would be charged $70 however. And this was a fee that could not be waived (without the customer later calling and kicking up a huge fuss)

___


The customer eventually cut the contractor off, firmly requesting that he ""leave the property"". At this point, I snapped out of listening with bemusement as the incompetent contractor fumbled for an excuse to steal money from us and the customer and realized ***he was at the customers home, alone and unsupervised to do this work***. That was strike two, and if he were a direct field technician instead of a contractor, would have been grounds for immediate on the spot termination of employment 

After the customer requested the contractor leave and then hung up. The contractor calmly picked his phone back up and asked me if I would ""force close"" the job. Essentially marking all work as completed without any testing and letting him pick up a paycheck and move on to his next job

I reiterated that he was to install the cable box, and reaffirmed the customers point that the existing cable wiring could be used

The contractor instead asked to have the job ""taken off him"". Which would have put the job into limbo until the customer called and had another technician or contractor scheduled. ***Not going to happen***

The field contractor sighed and quietly folded, agreeing to do what was expected of him


Fast forward to near the end of my shift. I'm typing up a report on the contractor. For (in order)

1. Lying to the customer in an attempt to inflate his commission payout

2. Being in a customers home when nobody else was present

3. Attempting to avoid doing the work he was assigned, while still being paid for it

Any one of these things is pretty much grounds for termination for regular employees, let alone contractors

But this contractor wasn't done. Oh no, he had other ideas! Looking over on the account, I noticed a few things

- The contractors job was still open. The job was assigned to his technician ID, and it was well past its completion time (the job was scheduled for something like 8AM to 10AM, it was now roughly 7:30 PM there)

- There was no cable box present on the account. I guess he didn't install it after all...?

- The customer had contacted us, and spoken to several representatives a few hours later


As it turned out. After hanging up the phone with me, the contractor proceeded to undo all the work he had already done. He took the already installed and active modem, and simply ***left***. He couldn't remove the modem from the customer's account, but he physically took it with him after leaving.

The customer had come home from work later that day, only to find a cable wire hanging over some table, and both their old and new modems simply ***GONE***


The customer had a new appointment scheduled shortly after, one with an in-house field technician rather than a contractor. I don't know if the contractor was ever fired, or if he was simply brushed off, still out there making mistakes left and right, all over Texas",False,177,13,intelminer,talesfromtechsupport

I pulled off my work clothes then tossed on my comfy bathrobe, poured myself up a glass of wine and then sat down at my gaming rig. Decided to boot up DOOM 2016 to blow off my frustration by blowing up demons. 


An hour or so later and I’m halfway through painting the Lazarus Labs in various shades of demon guts when I realise I’m monologuing to my Cthulhu plushie that sits next to my monitor about the unruly application. 
I'm blurting it all out and suddenly it all just clicks. Suddenly I KNOW what is wrong and how to fix it. I paused the game and quickly scribbled together a note on what to change the next day to get the application working. 


Today after I implemented my changes (Cthulhu’s changes?) I finally got it working as it was supposed to. I even impressed my more experienced coworkers with my fix.


Not as exciting or rage-inducing as my previous stories but I thought this would be a fun little short story to share.

119,"AC or not AC, *THAT* is the question??","So this is a tale from very early in my offshore career ( around 1996 or 1997 ). I did not yet have a passport, nor had I ever been outside of the US. We are preparing for a job that will start in Mexico and end in Peru. I'm asked to go to the r/V Oh Shucks ( not its real name ) and oversee the installation of a satellite phone which would provide voice and data services while the boat is overseas. At the time, I was more or less completely unfamiliar with satellite communications, but I was very comfortable with using cell phones ( bag phones ) for data using Telebit Worldblazers...

So, I go to the ship and watch an installer set up the radome, sat phone, and associate peripherals. We configure the sat phone to talk to the correct LES and make a few test calls. Then, I am tasked with dialing into one of the modems at the home office, establishing a connection and setting up UUCP on the boat to transfer email. All goes swimmingly, I get a little overtime, and I go home.

I get a call about a week later saying that the sat phone is not working. I also get the news that I'm about to take my first trip outside the US. Have I mentioned that I really knew next to nothing about satellite phones at this time?

So... the project manager and I fly out to Cozumel to meet the boat in ?Puente Morales?. I get to the boat, and the sat phone is up, but not getting any signal. I check things out as best I can, but everything looks fine. I pore over the manuals for a while, discovering nothing useful. I call up the vendor and tell them that I'm not getting any signal even when I manually enter coordinates. The connections to the GPS and ship gyro are all plugged in and working. They send out a tech that we'll call Mario. Mario is a Mexican satellite technician.

The first hurdle, upon meeting Mario, is that Mario doesn't speak ANY English. I don't speak ANY Spanish. Our communication devolves to pointing to various parts of the manual and shrugging at each other. After watching Mario run through all the same checks that I did, a tiny spark of inspiration strikes. I know that the antenna cable is hooked up to the sat phone... but what about the other end? So, I climb up a ladder, ignore all the dire radiation warnings, figure out how to open the radome, and stand up inside. One very important thing mentioned in the manual is that the stabilization gyroscopes \*MUST\* be running in order to be able to keep on target with the satellite of choice. Those gyroscopes are not running. In fact, there is not even a power connection for them.

So, I go downstairs to attempt to inform Mario of what I've found. After much pointing and gesticulation, Mario writes on a piece of paper that he can read and write English, he just can't speak it. \*smacks forehead\* WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO! So, I eventually get across to him that there is no power to the stabilizers and that they need 220 power to run. At this point, Mario looks at me and asks in all seriousness  ""Yes.... but 220 A/C or D/C?""

\*\*GET OFF MY BOAT!\*\*

I kicked Mario off the boat and immediately called our satellite rep. I explained the situation and they apologized and flew an installer down from Houston to fix the problem.

The installer couldn't believe that Mario had asked me that question and we had a good laugh over it. We established communications again, the turned the boat 180 degrees to verify that we were tracking the satellite... then I was allowed to fly home.

ETA: I think some people are rather missing the point. First, as the ""expert"" send down by the sat phone company, knowing whether the stabilizers ran on AC or DC seems like pretty fundamental information. Second, if the motors ran on 220VDC, it seems like the expert would know that the system came with a rectifier ( 220VDC is not something you would reasonably expect every boat to have ). Third, the manual VERY clearly stated 220VAC. All of these in concert destroyed every last shred of confidence I had in this guy as an ""expert"", which is how he was described to me. Lastly, this would be akin to calling your car dealership about some problems with your brand new Corvette and being told that your car would be taken care of by their Corvette EXPERT... who after looking at your car for an hour asks you whether it runs on diesel or gasoline....",False,99,31,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport

I resurrect the project in a code depot from long forgotten times only to find that it is missing DLLs for Lotus notes. pull an old install for it and tweak it to work with window 10. Discover that there is no dev environment so I can't even test run it. I look over the code to find all of the email boxes it connects to, but don't see the one from the email part of the request.

Normally the stories posted on here are stories of tech support anguish brought on by incompetent/stupid/lazy (delete as appropriate) users but this story has no users to blame.

First a little background. I am a senior desktop engineer however my role is somewhat fluid and I spend more time these days looking after our asset management system (I’ll just call it ASM) and supporting the other engineers. As I was only one of two people who was present when our ASM was installed and configured, I am pretty much responsible for it. This ASM does almost everything for us. Deploying software, deploying Operating Systems, Inventory, Remote support and reporting, you get the drill.

So, one-day last week I get into to work and first job of the morning is to make sure everything is okay with ASM. A service tends to get stuck, a quick digital slap will normally get it going again. No such problems, just a normal morning… for about 20 minutes. Then just hell. The ASM console stops responding on my device. “Hmmm.” I mumble to myself “Let me check the console on the server”. Console initially loads up fine but the dashboard display is sat on loading and if I click on schedules… nothing, not responding, crash, error 404, fatality, nobody home, go straight to jail, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

Damn.

I start doing the usually checks like restarting some services, only I get the rather annoying cannot stop service error. No matter, I know a trick, let me get my sledge hammer. I’m going to force choke this service until dead then restart it. I manage to kill off the service and go to restart it but the service times out trying to start. “Wut?”. That has never happened before. Hmm.

By this time, half the office next door has walked in asking if there is a problem with the ASM as they can’t log in. “Yes, I’m on it.” I exclaim.

Okay, time to do ‘the first step of troubleshooting’. I reboot the server. Server reboots fine. I open the console… still not playing ball. I play around in the console and I realise that not all the functions are down. I can navigate the console just fine. Only the schedule element is dead in the water. Now I should explain what that means. Our ASM uses what is called 'schedules' to push out software, run reports and deploy OS. So while I can navigate the console, check inventories and even remote to devices, no one can deploy any software or image devices, so 95% of what the ASM is used for is not working.

At this point I’m at a loss. I have scoured the Event Logs but I must stress, my background is in client devices. I have no real server experience and I don’t like messing with them. I have some ideas on what else could be the problem, maybe permissions on some shares have changed (this caused another migraine a few months ago), maybe IIS has crapped out or maybe the SQL database has fallen over.. Well that last one doesn’t make too much sense because I can access the information in the console which comes from the database.

Anyway, I send out an email to the team letting them know the situation and check with the other teams if they have done anything on the network or databases. Nada, nope, nothing. Well, nothing for it then. I am going to have to admit defeat and contact the support company.

I log the problem and as per usual, they ask me to send over a crap ton of logs. While I’m waiting for someone their end to make sense of the matrix I have just sent them, I’m checking through every document I can find on their support portal for anything like the issue we are seeing.

I tried everything including and not limited to. Resetting connections on the database. Changing the accounts on the connections to the database. Checking through all the settings on and resetting IIS. Checking permissions on all the shares. Comparing the settings within the ASM to the screenshots of the settings taken when it was set up. Checking permissions on the SQL Database. Checking every warning and critical error in the event log. Nothing worked.

Support finally get back to me late in the day and they think the problem is with the SQL Database. They say the application is timing out talking to the database because the requests are getting rejected on the database side.

Oh, I’m not a DB admin by the way so yay.

I head round to the next office where luckily DBA guy is there. I explain what they said and forward him some details of some stuff they wanted us to try. As I said, it was late in the day by this point and no way any of this was going to get done now. We agree to take another look the next morning.

I come in the next day and part of me was hoping whatever the problem was, it would sort itself over night. No such luck. I meet up with DBA guy who then runs all these magic SQL things they suggested. I’m still fishing through support documents at this point. After half an hour DBA guy comes back and tells me all those ‘cleaning’ processes are done. I fire up the ASM console with bated breath and… 

No. Still FUBAR’d.

Oh, did I mention we had absolutely no management team in that week. I was literally the highest-ranking member of staff in our department. I was starting to think we were going to need to do a complete rebuild of our core ASM server to fix this thing. Panic was slowly starting to creep in I tell you.

I reported back to the support guy that after doing what they asked with the database that it made no difference and were still unable to do anything.  While I waited for a reply, I resumed searching through the archives of no help whatsoever, trying to find anything that could save me from this plight.

Then it happened.

My colleague next to me was mumbling about a problem ticket he had and them needing something installed. I asked him “Is it a 32 bit or 64 bit OS?”. “I dunno, I can’t check ASM.” He said.  I loaded up the ASM console on my computer. “Oh wait, is ASM working now?” he said. “Sort of, the console works, you can get in and navigate. Just don’t click on any schedules or try to schedule anything”. I had already explained this. He then tries to load the console on his device and it doesn’t load. “It’s not working on mine.” “Oh really! Is it running in the background? Maybe it crashed and is sat in the background. That can happen sometimes”.

I get him to load up Task manager on his device and sure enough the ASM console is running. He kills it off and then launches the console. It loads up. I go back to my computer and notice all the dashboards have loaded…

Wait a fudging minute. No way.

I close the console and open it again and the dashboards load almost instantaneously. I click on the schedules and they load. All of a sudden, the ASM system is back up and running. This cannot be a coincidence. I have not just spent a day and a half trying to find out why our ASM is crapping the bed only to discover it was my colleague’s computer with a messed-up console running in the background.

I passed this information onto the support and they said they had never heard of this before but it could potentially happen as each console has direct connection to the database. So if one console badly misbehaves it could lock out an element of the database which in turn could cause the services on the core to fail.

Wow, just wow. In some way, I am thankful my colleague hardly ever reboots his computer because if he had, the issue would have been fixed the next morning and I would have no idea why.

Oh, to work in I.T.

TL;DR

137,Beware of sysadmins carrying oxy-acetylene torches...,"I'm sure you've all heard the expression ""Beware of programmers carrying screwdrivers"", right? Well... this is just a tiny bit different. 

As a sysadmin on a ship, I was responsible for many things... The network as a whole, our internet connection, phones, servers, PC's, Ipods... You name it. Further, I was responsible for the various sensors that allowed our systems to work. I was also the resident multibeam sonar expert. So... one day... I'm called down to the survey lab because our two YSI probes are showing different values. YSI probes measure salinity and temperature so that we can get an accurate measurement of the speed of sound through the water at the surface ( critical for accurate multibeam data ). Now, these can be calibrated on the fly, but no matter what we do, one is obviously WAY off. These probes are mounted in a ""sea chest"" in the engine room. A sea chest is just a piece of pipe teed off of the inlet for cooling water or desalination, or whatever. 

So, I grab a fellow sysadmin and head down to the engine room.  Along the way, I pass the Chief Engineer who sees us each grab a set of earmuffs and head into the engine room. Now, he's seen various survey crew head into the engine room to check on various pieces of our equipment, but he's never seen the ""computer guys"" head into the engine room, and I guess this sparks his curiosity.  We emerge a couple of minutes later and head upstairs only to return almost immediately with a couple of wrenches and a ratchet. Again, we disappear into the engine room. About 15 minutes later, we emerge and head upstairs and return within a minute or so with an impact wrench. This time he hears about 15-20 minutes worth of impact wrench noise, before we both emerge yet again, dripping with sweat. I ask him if we can use his oxy-acetylene torch and he hesitantly agrees, but follows us to see what we're up to. I open the valves on the oxygen and acetylene bottles and coil up about 40 feet of hose on my should and grab the torch, a sparker, and a set of goggles. We approach the sea chest and explain that the bolts holding it close are frozen and that we're going to heat them up to break them loose. He eyes us rather skeptically and starts to ask if I really know how to operate a torch. At which point I crack the acetylene valve open on the torch head, hit the sparker, and turn on the oxygen until I get a blue flame. I hit the oxygen handle a couple of times and smile in what I hope is a reassuring manner. He's still watching with some trepidation as we heat up each nut and my fellow sysadmin attacks the corresponding bolt with the impact wrench. Within a few minutes we have all 8 bolts off and we swap out the barnacle encrusted sensor probes with fresh new ones and get the sea chest bolted back together. I put the torch back where it belong and the engineer follows us out muttering something about the world coming to an end when the computer guys can handle a torch. LOL 

We were able to get the new sensors calibrated and were back to work in probably 2 hours. This was not the first or only time that I saw someone completely shocked that a ""computer guy"" had skills outside of computers. ",False,2054,249,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
138,It's a clock. Clocks tell time.,"This story takes place many moons ago when I was back home on one of my first breaks from college.  I was the family IT guy and really the only person who knew anything more about a computer than browsing Facebook.

For some back story, my parents had bought a couple old Compaq laptops (that they always left plugged in...) that they complained about always being slow.  My mother had asked me to do something about it, like what I had done with one of my old computers (which was just installing a light linux distro).

These machines were now running Ubuntu, with all their commonly used programs in the dock, which basically consisted of Chrome and Solitaire.  It was a simple, easy-to-use setup for them and less hassle on me to maintain.

Whenever I was home, I'd update everything, install any new tools I had learned about, and make sure everything under the hood was hidden from them, so they'd have as painless of an experience as possible.

Until one day...

I'll be $Me, and dear old mother will be $Mom.


$Mom:  $Me, whatever you did broke the computer!

*lolwut.  I haven't done anything to the computer today.*

$Me:  What's it doing?

$Mom:  It's not doing anything.  It's broken.  You need to stay off my computer!

*You say this until you need help googling something again...*

$Me:  Here, let me look at it.

*She shows me the computer.  It's on a screensaver with a digital clock.*

$Me:  That's just a screensaver.  It goes to that when you haven't used it in a bit.

$Mom:  What's that for!?  I don't want it!  You must've installed something and broke it!

$Me:  If you click, it'll go away.  I didn't install anything.  It's just a clock.

$Mom:  What's it do?  I don't want that!

$Me:  It's a clock.  It's just telling you the time.

*I'm really just trying to figure out why this is an issue.*

$Mom:  Why!?  I don't want it.

$Me:  The computer does that automatically after a set time if you haven't used it in awhile.  It keeps people from messing with your computer if you're away.  It's just being friendly and telling you the time.

$Mom:  I don't know what that's for!  What's the clock for?  Uninstall it!

*I'd already began the process of finding the setting to disable screensavers and also questioning my mother's understanding of clocks.*


All in all, a simple fix.  I've got a few more stories as the family IT guy if you all are interested, including the story of my mom having me set up a surround sound on a broken TV and kicking me out.

$Me is a field service technician for a chain of retail stores

I walked into my first site for this week and $HC immediately flags me down and rushes over. The following events began:

$HC: ""We have a register down on front end and it's critical we have it back up today!""
$Me: ""Sure, let's go take a look at it.""

$HC escorts me to aforementioned register.

$Me: ""Ok. So what's the issue?""
$HC: ""It just doesn't work.""
$Me: ""What is it specifically doing or not doing?""
$HC: ""It's just not doing anything! Fix it!x

So, I began my troubleshooting. After about 30 seconds, I discovered the issue lied inside the cash drawer. Specifically, the Ethernet port that connects to the docking bay inside the terminal. It was busted to the point I had to dig it out of the register in 4 pieces.

$Me: *Showing the issue* ""I'll have to order this part. This isn't something I carry in my vehicle stock.""
$HC goes on rant of how nothing ever gets fixed.
$Me: ""How did it get like this? These things don't just sort of implode by themselves...""
$HC: ""Well, it stopped working over the weekend and I called the help desk. They said to check that cable that went into the cash drawer. It was a little loose and they said it needed to be pushed in securely. So I gave it a tap to make sure.""
$Me: ""... What'd you tap it with?""
$HC: ""I found a rubber mallet in the cupboard so I used it to help me. But the help desk told me to make sure it's secure! It's their fault!""

140,Leapin' Lizards!,"Good afternoon and welcome to my tale of flammable fauna.

A little background first:  I am the repair department (just me!) for a company that manufactures power conversion equipment.  We service everything we sell, from benchtop supplies to megawatt size systems. 

On this particular day, I had arrived at work to find a backlog of units waiting to be evaluated.  Three in particular drew my interest as they were infrequent guests at our power electronics spa.  As I uncrated them, I noticed that there was not a scrap of identifying documentation.  At the very least, there should be a RMA number visible somewhere on the crate, paperwork, and/or unit.  I need this to process the unit(s) into our system and to see what the customer is having trouble with.  Nothing.  Fantastic.

I emailed the responsible parties for more information so that I can process these units and start fixing them.  Part of the information that I requested was any symptoms or fault codes seen by the customer or field service team.  The field service tech responded with the following:

""Unit has damage to the high voltage busswork from **gecko**.  Power modules need repair and test.""

Wait, *what*?  **Gecko**?  I replied to his email and asked him if that was a typo.  His response was:

""Nope, no typo.  Look at the high voltage bussing in the back of the module.  You can't miss it!""

He had me at gecko.  My interest now fully piqued, I tore the crate open and hefted the unit on top of another crate.  Sure enough, there was a carbon outline of a gecko, surrounded by scorched and pitted copper.  The unit came from Hawaii where these critters are everywhere, apparently.  This little insurance spokeslizard decided he needed a little pick-me-up and took a stroll across the insulation separating the positive and negative plates, effectively shorting 1100VDC with his moist limbs.  Poof!  No more saving 15% or more!

Usually they need to open a support case, but I give a few of my clients my card and tell them I can answer ""small questions."" 


I wasn't familiar with the information she needed, so I told her she should open a case with another group that would have the information. She said thanks in a reply.


Then I get another email from her. She sent a message to my personal email the first time, and the second time she sent the same message, word for word, to the generic training email box, which I have access to. I tell the other trainer, and she says I should copy and paste my exact original response. So I did.

142,"Wait, why am I here?","I've been a lurker here since 2015, but since I was in college at the time, I never had any particularly interesting tech support stories. Fast forward to the end of December 2017 and I'm looking for a job — Java or web development. I get a call from $HelpfulJobAgency with an interesting offer, one I don't regret taking, even if that was the day things started getting weird. 

See, $HJA doesn't take your money; instead, they fly you out to their campus, train you in a 10-week boot-camp the different technologies companies use that you don't usually pick ip in college, pay you minimum wage, and then sell you with a two year contract to another company. It's a nice deal, and I picked up a certificate along the way.

The problem started day one, when I was assigned to the group that would be learning Pega — a Java-based BPM suite. I'd never heard of it before, but neither had anyone else in my class, so I wasn't too worried. I was just a little mad that I'd interviewed to be a Java developer and was put there instead, but I got over it quickly. 

The weeks go by, and training is hard. Pega is very different from any other programming language, and there were parts to it I struggled to pick up on; no big deal, I could study on my own or learn on the job. (I'd later regret thinking that; Pega is very starved in terms of help documentation and my future job... we'll get to that.) Eventually, I'm contacted by $InternationalTechCompany through $HJA for a developer interview. 

While waiting to hear back from them, $HJA sets me up with several other interviewers, including another department of $ITC, all for developer positions. I don't get a choice in where I go, though; whichever one accepts me first is the one I'm contractually obligated to go to. I think little of this, but I'm starting to get a little nervous abour how vague these positions are. By this point there's been several other communication issues, but they generally got resolved for the best in the end. I trusted that this would be the same. 

And so, about a month and a half ago, I was hired. But, besides being labeled an ""associate,"" I had no idea where I'd be going or what I'd be doing, besides ""Pega work in the USA.""

A week in onboarding/on bench finally sees me transferred to my new position. And there, I *finally* get an answer to the specifics of my job:

143,My printer won't turn on...,"Hopefully, you guys don't mind me jumping around in time. I'm afraid I don't remember stories in chronological order. For the first few stories, we are back at the bank. Eventually, I will post stories from my other jobs.

The following three mini stories all happened in the same week. Three different branches called in more or less the exact same problem. 

1) 

$me: Helpdesk, this is $me. How can I help you?

$teller: We can't turn our MICR printer on. 

$me: Okay, can you verify that the power cable is plugged firmly into the printer?

$teller: It is.

$me: Okay, is the other end plugged into the wall or into a power strip? 

$teller: It's plugged into a power strip.

$me, Is the power strip turned on? 

$teller: Yes, yes, and the power strip is plugged into the wall. 

$me: Okay, what happens when you flip the power switch? 

$teller: Nothing at all, no lights, nothing. 

$me: Hmm... Okay, can you plug a fan or lamp or something into the power strip to make sure that you have power? 

$teller: I can plug my phone charger in... and it's charging my phone? 

$me: Well, as unlikely as it seems, I guess you have a dead printer. I'll send someone out to take a look. 

The next day I get an email from the contract tech that the power cable was barely hanging out of the printer. All he had to do was plug it all the way in. I got fussed at by my boss for sending a contract tech out to plug in a power cable... 

\---

2)

A day or two after this incident, with the scolding fresh in my mind. Another branch calls in. 

$me: Helpdesk, this is $me, how can I help you?

$teller: Our network printer won't come on. 

$me(internal): Not again?!

$me: Can you verify that the power cable is plugged into the printer?

$teller: It is. 

$me: please unplug the power cable and jam it back in as hard as you can. 

$teller: Okay, I've done that. 

$me: Is it plugged directly into the wall or into a power strip? 

$teller: It's plugged into the wall. 

$me: Can you unplug it and plug it back in as hard as you can?

$teller: Okay, now what? 

$me: Please try to turn the printer off then on again.

$teller: Still nothing. 

$me: Can you make sure that the outlet has power by plugging in a fan or lamp or something? 

$teller: Okay. It has power. 

$me: Okay, I guess you have a dead printer. I will send someone out. 

The next day I get an email from the tech that the outlet had no power because a breaker had tripped. He reset the breaker and everything worked. Again, I was scolded for sending a tech out to flip a breaker. 

\---

3) A day or two following the most recent incident, yet another branch calls in saying that their printer won't come on. My boss's office is literally feet from my cubicle. By the time I finish the call, he is literally in tears. 

$me: Helpdesk, this is $me, how can I help you?

$teller: Our printer won't come on. 

$me: You aren't fooling me this time... 

$teller: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that .What did you say? 

$me: Oh nothing... Can you verify that the power cable is plugged into the printer? 

$teller: It is. 

$me: Please pull the power cord out and jam it back in as hard as you can. 

$teller: Are you sure? 

$me: YES

$teller: Okay, done, now what? 

$me: Is the other end plugged into the wall or a power strip? 

$teller: It's plugged into a power strip. 

$me: please unplug it and jam the plug back into the power strip as hard as you can. 

$teller: Okay...

$me: Now, is the power switch glowing red on the power strip? 

$teller: No

$me: Okay, make sure the power strip is plugged into the wall, then unplug it and ram it back into the outlet as hard as you can. Then tell me if the light came on. 

$teller: ... uh.. no, the light is still off...

$me: Please flip the switch on the power strip. 

$teller: It's on now. 

$me: please plug a fan or radio into the power strip so that I can hear that it has power. 

$teller: Okay, can you hear it? 

$me: Yes, I can confirm that you have power .

$me: please try to turn the printer on again

$teller: It's still not working. 

$me(internal): @#$%#!!!!

$me: Okay, I will send out a technician. 

The next day, I get an email from the contract tech that the printer had a faulty power switch. 

$boss: You deserve an attaboy for that last printer. You were exceedingly thorough, and we definitely needed to send a tech out. Also, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life!

\---

Okay, still at the bank for this one... Rather than a conversation style, this will be more of a story. 

One day, one of our mortgage branches calls in and says ""Nobody but Mary can print."". Huh, that's a bit weird. I call in and speak to several people ( the entire office is 8 people ). They have access to the internet, they can see other machine, but they can't print. Mary can print just fine. The printer ( a Toshiba copier ) is accessible through the web interface and is not reporting any errors. Just for fun, I share the printer from Mary's PC and map the printer through Mary's PC on a user's machine. She is then able to print just fine. We power cycle the printer, and still nobody can print. We map everybody through Mary's PC but leave the original printer just in case. We attempt to research the issue. We find NOTHING. A few days later, the same branch calls back. Now Mary can't print, but one of the others can. Again, that person is the ONLY person who can print. We try various things including rebooting pretty much every piece of equipment in the office. Everyone has internet access as well as intranet... We again escalate the problem to network infrastructure, and again, they find nothing. We map everyone through that person's PC and everybody can print that way. About two weeks later, another branch calls with the exact same issue... on the other side of the country. By the end, we had about 5 branch locations calling every month or so with the same story. We never did find a cause, reason, or good solution. 

\---

And my last printer story for today. This time, this is a story from my time working for City Hall. 

$me: Helpdesk, this is $me, how can I help you?

$user: I can't print. 

$me: Okay, what happens when you try to print? 

$user: Nothing!

$me: \*sigh\* That doesn't really tell me anything. Do you get an error message? 

$user: No, just nothing comes out of the printer. I don't have time to do this on the phone, could you just come up here? 

$me: OKay, I'll be up shortly. 

So... I go upstairs and into the accounting cubicle farm. There are three cubicle in a row against the wall, each with only 3 sides. User is in the last cubicle. I ask her which printer she's having problems with and she literally turns her chair around and points to a printer TEN FEET away. Without taking a single step towards the printer, I immediately see the problem. There's a red blinking light on the printer. As I approach, I see the dreaded error message: Please load letter. User had sent the same print job 43 times... each time it didn't print, she would angrily send the print job again. I informed the user that the printer was out of paper, that she should perhaps put paper in it, and that she should verify that the printer has paper before sending 42 more print jobs and certainly before she calls the helpdesk. \*sigh\* Users...

**Today's events**

I'm currently a part of our first level support hotline, the first place customers call when they experience a problem or have a question about one of our products' features, as they can be quite complicated even for experienced users. The following is a write up of 3 calls I had in the span of about half an hour, all by the same customer. 
  
\--
  
$Me = That one dude from that one movie  
$C = Customer who doesn't quite know what words being said through the phone mean.  
$Co = Coworker who I share an office with.  
MDE = What we call the devices, short for Mobile Data Entry.
  
\--
  
*Call one, $C has called twice before about the same issue*

&gt;$Me: ""[Company name], $Me speaking, good morning.""


&gt;$C: ""[Customer's company], $C speaking. Every time I scan an article for stocktaking purposes, our MDE device gives us the error ""EAN not found in database"". Can you assist us?""  


At this point my colleague looks at me in a ""are you kidding me"" manner, as he took both of the previous calls of $C. He motions for me to mute my microphone.  

&gt;$Co: ""If this is actually $C, ask her if she removed the device from the dock.""

*So I ask her.*

She removed it. Because apparently, the computer screen reading ""sending files"" means that you can remove the device from the dock that connects it to the computer. $Co is not very amused and tells me to tell $C to re-insert the device, and wait until we call her back before removing the device again. She agrees and thanks us for our assistance.

The database, which has to be moved from the POS system to the MDE device can take a while to transfer. For her setup, it was about 15 minutes of transferring the files along with 5 minutes of waiting afterwards for the MDE device to import the database into our software.

*End of call one*

\--

*Act two, five minutes later*

&gt;$C calls. $Co groans. Several other people can be heard groaning as they had dealt with the same thing last time that customer took stock, exactly a year ago.

*So I answer the phone.*

&gt;$Me: ""[Company name], $Me speaking, good morning.""


&gt;$C: ""[Customer's company], $C speaking. I think we just talked? A co-worker told me to just close the error message and continue working, but all I can see is some kinda background and the software isn't there.""

&gt;$Me: ""Did you remove the device from the dock?""  

I wouldn't be typing this if she hadn't. She removed it.

$Co groans again as he already knew what $C would answer to my question.  So we repeat the whole spiel of getting her to put the device back in, restarting the database transfer, and telling her to keep her fingers off the device until we call her. To our surprise, she actually let the transfer finish before calling back the next time.

*End of act two*

\--

*Episode III, about twenty minutes after the last call*  

&gt;$C calls once again. I answer once again. At this point, $Co is getting really annoyed.  

&gt;$Me: ""[Company name], $Me speaking, good morning.""

&gt;$C: ""[Customer's company], $C speaking once again. The transfer seems to have finished, can I remove the device and use it now?""  

&gt;$Me: ""Just let me check if the files have been imported into the software yet to make sure it will work once you scan an article.""

I check. The files were transferred and imported. I open the software on the MDE device (there's an application that lets us control the device from the PC as long as it's connected to the dock). $C is happy, I am happy. 

*It would not stay this way for long.*

*End of Episode III*  

\--

*Part 3.0 + 1.0, a call which I did not answer but $Co did.*

$Co was getting agitated and wanted to get done with this customer for today. So he answered the call.

&gt;$Co: ""[Company name], $Co speaking, good morning.""

&gt;$C: ""[Customer's company], $C speaking once again. I tried scanning an article on one of the other MDE devices, but they gave the same error message as the one I've called about before.""

$Co looks like he saw someone kick a puppy. He remains calm and explains to her that we'll have to transfer the database to the two other devices as well, as she probably removed the devices before the database was fully transferred and imported into the software on the MDE.

The call ends, $Co looks defeated. $C doesn't call back.  

*End of Part 3.0 + 1.0*

\--

Now, this wouldn't be fun if she didn't call again, would it? And of course, I take the call, because I'm the apprentice and the others are very obviously annoyed.

What follows is the explanation that no, *we can't do every single thing she needs to do on our software for her stocktaking to finish.*   
I manage to do what no other of my coworkers was able to do without proper knowledge on how the stocktaking works on our system: I can sell her stocktaking assistance for 2 hours on the following day, explaining to her how the things she has to do during stocktaking are described in the software's manual, and if she'd rather have someone from our company assist her during it, she'd have to pay for that as it's not part of the money she pays to have support (which is meant for problems with our software or questions, but not ~15 calls over 3 days about her not knowing how to do stocktaking after having done it for a few years already, with her citing that she doesn't need to remember as she can just call us). For some reason, that clicked with $C (she was told this multiple times before and did not accept it).  
$Co congratulates me and hands over our ""supporter of the week"" medal (a cheap metal medal with a piece of paper taped onto it saying ""supporter of the week"") and $C did not call back anymore.

*Now to wait until tomorrow, to see what disasters $C will unleash unto poor $Co, who has volunteered to help her. Bless his soul.*",False,112,14,DarkbirdX,talesfromtechsupport
145,"Can you just, like, fix it?","I don't technically work in tech support, but I do work at a phone store and I do perform basic tech support for basic problems that aren't related to service or the phone at all. 

A customer walked in today, held her phone out to me, and said, ""Yesterday my phone said I changed my Gmail password but I didn't and now my password won't work, can you just, like, fix it?""

I obviously said I could try, and took her through password recovery for Gmail. It prompted her to receive a text with a code. ""That's my old number, I never put in my new number.""

Okay. No big deal, let's keep going. It prompted her to receive a notification on her LG device. I looked at the iPhone in my hand and asked her if she had access to her old LG phone. ""No, I threw it away.""

...okay. Last ditch effort, it prompted for any email she'd attached to this one as her recovery email. ""I only have one email."" 

Nope, sorry, you're shit outta luck. Next time try not to make your password the literal reverse phrase of the email address.",False,87,26,PhaerieTail,talesfromtechsupport

147,Spending oddities...,"The company I worked for when I worked offshore left me with many, many stories. Some amusing, some exciting, many just worthy of a head shake. This collection of very very brief anecdotes are about spending money...

\--

When I was working in Key West, we were having trouble performing a patch test ( calibration ) for out multibeam system. I had done MANY patch tests in the past and was one of the go to people to do one. This particular system was kicking my butt. None of the calibration answers made ANY sense. So, they send out one of the senior programmers who is even more experienced and we collectively scratch our heads for several hours. We've tested just about everything we can test, and nothing makes any sense. Finally, the programmer asks us to put the boat on the trailer and leave it parked in a parking lot. We collect motion sensor and gps data from all sensors for a few hours and notice that the motion sensor thinks that we are in heavy seas... positions are all over the place. We call the office and rather than calling the vendor to fix the unit, they call one of our sales people at a trade show and get them to pick up the DEMO unit that $squid was using to show off there new position sensor. Sales person buys the demo unit on the spot for $70,000, drives it to an airport, and buys a plane ticket for the motion sensor. We had it in about 5 hours. Did I mention that the other motion sensor was under warranty? Or that I had requested and been denied a replacement keyboard for the data collection computer on the boat?

\--

I was invited to take part in setting up a seismic boat for the company. We had just bought a 2 million dollar streamer cable ( hydrophones ) and a collection system. We also bought training for about a dozen of us and invested in all sorts of new hardware, including  a pair of GI guns as sound sources and a 4,000 PSI air compressor. When we asked for chaffing gear to protect the 2 million dollar cable ( probably would have cost us about $2,000 ) we were denied. We ended up getting a couple of old fire hoses from a fire department and a few hundred dollars worth of tape and making our own... 12 people working for 2 days to make it...

\--

One of the boats I worked on had hull mounted sensors as well as an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ( worth about 4 million dollars, and we charged $100,00 per day to run it ). I was tasked with setting up an additional multibeam system that would be mounted to a pole ( high resolution, high frequency ). We get to the boat, and we are missing the screws to mount the transducer to the pole. It's 11pm on a Saturday night. The nearest fastener store has been closed since Friday at 5pm. I called my boss to tell him the bad news. My boss calls around until he finds the store manager. Store manager says he won't open the store unless the order is more than $2,000. We needed about $100 worth of bolts. We paid $2000 for those bolts. We had the bolts at the office, but it would have taken 4 hours to get them to us, plus time to install them. Having the guy open the store probably saved us around $14,000.... My boss was very happy that we weren't delayed at $4,000 an hour... The store manager was thrilled to get a nearly $2000 bonus. Everybody wins!

\--

\--

 I was sent to Japan to help mobilize a new ( to us ) boat. One of my fellow techs and I were busying ourselves setting up the various computers in the lab. The boat, for the record, was a Russian boat. We got the workstations and servers all set up and we were moving to the various PC's. My fellow technician forgot that Russian power is 200V @ 50Hz and possibly also forgot about the little red switch on the back of the power supply to switch it from 110 to 220. We \*ALWAYS\* had spares for everything, so this was not seen as a disaster... until one of the surveyors decided to help us plug in machines. Poof! Two machines up in smoke. We called the office and they flew someone from the US with $10k in cash to get replacement machines. This was a nightmare in and of itself.

Our credit cards did not work in Japan at this time. We had $10k in US currency, which no shop would take. The only money changer we could find was a bank. The bank was EXTREMELY suspicious of 6 Americans trying to change $10k. They limited us to $1k per person per day and they insisted on inspected each bill individually... in great detail. So, we managed to get $6k exchanged. Which turned out to be exactly enough to buy two of the cheapest machines we could get our hands on. Which were running Windows ME... In Japanese... I had to get the client rep to walk me through getting it set up enough to change languages. Those two machines died about 4 months later...",False,403,26,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
148,data rates may apply,"So, this will be a little different than previous posts. This is a small collection of very short stories involving sending data to/from ships at sea. These stories data from the early 2000's and involve data connections as fast as 64kbps ( just slightly faster than a 56k modem ) to as low as 2400 baud.

All of our boats had email capabilities, but it was severely restricted. This was our only form of communication other than making cell/satellite phone calls. Satellite phones calls were costing us roughly $5 per minute regardless of whether it was a phone or data call. Roaming charges for the analog cell phones in the Gulf of Mexico were around $2-$3 per minute.

Emails were generally text only with no attachments. There were some attachments that were approved, but for most you had to get special permission or know how to bypass the system. The method that was used for bypassing the filters involved putting a special header in your email, which could be tracked.

For our first story, we are working in the Gulf of Mexico and we need a wiring diagram or instructions on how to wire a connector to a singlebeam transducer ( fathometer ). There were 4 pins. This could have been as simple as a quick text email saying that pin1 was clockwise from the index pin and pin1 is transmit, etc. Instead, on of the less technical people at the office decides to email us a diagram. As I recall, it took us 6 hours to receive the email. Remember, this email cost us $2-$3 per MINUTE. Not only that, but for those 6 hours, we were unable to work, costing us probably another $5,000 or so. When we FINALLY received the email, we figured out why it took so long. The user took a page from a manual, scanned it in from a network fax machine as a type 3 TIFF, then imported that TIFF into a word document, then attached that word document to an email. The results file was several megabytes. If he had scanned the file as a jpeg and attached that to his email, it probably would have been less than 10k.

For the next story... The people that were sent to demob ( take all of our equipment off ) a boat were generally not the same people sent to mobilize a boat. The demob crew just had to disconnect everything and get it boxed up to send back to the office. They generally didn't know or care what cable went to what, they just pulled it all down and packaged it neatly for shipment. I'm working off the coast of Singapore when I am awakened by someone telling me that I have a phone call ( extremely rare, generally some sort of emergency ). So, I haul ass downstairs to see what's worth calling me at $5 per minute. The person on the other side is a sysadmin trainee that I've worked with a few times and he's obviously panicked. He got sent out with the demob crew to shut down one of our ships. When they were about halfway through tearing everything out, they got a call that there was a job for that ship and to put everything back. They had no idea how to do that, so I spent the next 3 hours trying to walk them through setting up machines blindly over a satellite phone call with 2-3 second latency. So... 3 hours == 180 minutes x 2 because the call was from a sat phone TO a sat phone and you see that this one phone call was about $3,600. We managed to get them set back up to go back to work. Generally the management at the office would lose their minds over a $15 minute phone call... I guess a $3,600 phone call was cheaper than losing the job or flying someone out to help them get set up. LOL

The last story of these for now ( I'm sure I'll think of more ), is even more expensive. Again, this was 2000 or 2001. We generally did not have antivirus software on our computers offshore. The computers were isolated, so it generally wasn't a problem. I'm assuming one of our client reps had a cd or thumb drive that was infected and tried to read that data on one of our CAD machines. We not only didn't have the software on our computers, we didn't have a copy of any antivirus to install. Cue the following phone call to the office.

$me: (calls my boss at the office)

$boss; Hey $me, what's up?

$me: The CAD machine has a virus. We need antivirus software to clean it.

$boss: That sounds bad, can you pull a spare machine to replace it?

$me: yes, but I don't know how many more machines are infected or what the source of the infection is.

$boss: oh crap, I didn't think of that. Let me hand you over to our IT guys

$me: ok

$IT: We can't send you our antivirus software, it would take several hours and cost thousands of dollars

$me: I have at least one machine with a virus. If TWO CAD machines get this virus, we won't be able to make maps. If the virus spreads to a data collection machine, we won't be able to work at all. This is a multimillion dollar project.

$IT: How close are you to land? Can you head into port?

$me: We are 200 miles out. It would take us a full day to get to port and a full day to get back to the jobsite, plus whatever time it takes us to find a copy of this software in a store.

$IT: The project manager could get a copy and helicopter it out to you?

$me: We are heading away from Singapore. by the time the project manager got a copy and hired a helicopter, we would be out of helicopter range.

$IT: \*sigh\* Fine. I'll talk to management about how much this will cost and why it's necessary.

$me: THANK YOU!

End result? It took 20ish hours to get the antivirus software. 20\*60=1200.  1200\*5=$6,000.  We were able to get all the  PC's on the boat scanned and protected within a day. Map making was delayed for about a day. The only other machine that was affected was the client rep's laptop.",False,1073,178,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
149,Network accounts unavailable,"This tale features one dizzy techie ($Me), the lovely client ($Client) and a hoarde of iMacs in a tried-and-tested network.    

#      Prologue    

  
I contract for $Client since a few years ago (remote and on-site IT  support and maintenance). The person who contracted before me left me  with an Apple Notes database of passwords and random setup checklists  and troubleshooting tips, but no documentation of the network configuration at all.      
For remote management and support all of  the computers (90% Apple) are signed into the same Apple ID and use  „Back To My Mac” for VNC &amp; Management. This has worked okay for a  few years but is unreliable since the $Client's ISP switched them from  native IPv4 to IPv6. So it's time to look for a new solution. A VPN + DDNS combo should suffice - once I'm connected to the local Mac server I can connect to the local computers and manage everything through VNC.  After testing a Synology RT1900AC Wi-Fi router at home I found it works  perfectly for this setup (Synolgoy provides DDNS service and SSL VPN  server &amp; client apps). So I call $Client and have them order a  RT1900AC.    

# Chapter 1: the plan    

  
Because they need  working network during business hours, I arrive at $Client at 8:30 in  the evening. All staff have left, so I can roam free and start to look  at the network configuration. There have never been any major network  issues since I contract with them, so I haven't looked at the setup closely yet. I find four Ethernet switches, four WiFi routers as well as  two internet modems and one phone modem. It seems there are two  internet connections running parallel into a modem and router each and  then meet in a rack-mounted router with two WAN ports. Digging through the Notes, I find login info for the rack router and discover it's configured to manage WAN failover (the new router also supports this).  
Properly  documenting the network took me over an hour due to horrible web  interface of the different routers and modems and multiple WiFi networks  with random devices around the building connecting to different ones. There was even a digital camera on its own network. Next, I tried to set  up the new Synology router as Wireless Access point to replace the rack  router. I decided to keep the rack router for the day because I was running late and decided to simply add the Synology in between the main DSL router and the rack router to test the remote access features, with  no change to the rest of the network. Both DDNS and remote access worked  right away and I tested the connection stability using one of the  iMacs. For this I had to disconnect it from Ethernet and connect to my  smartphone Hotspot to get outside the network. I was able to access the  router via remote management website, all is well and after making sure I  reset to internal network access, I went home (very late). I decided to  leave my phone on during the night. That way in case something broke, the $Client could reach me in the morning.    

# Chapter 2: the call

  
Next morning at 7:30 am, my phone rings me out of bed.      
$Me, super sleepy: ""Helluh?""      
$Client: ""Hi $Me. Please you have to help the computers are not working I can't use this how can I get it working please help""      
$Me, startled: ""Slow down please whoa, what is not working?""      
$Client:  ""The computer is not working. Try to put my name and password and it  doesn't work. Nothing is working. I have restarted it three times  already. Did you change something last night?""      
$Me: ""Well I  did install the new router for testing, but the computers haven't  changed in any way. Can you describe what you see on the computer?""      
$Client: ""There's this screen where I put my name."" ($Client is trying to say login screen)      
$Me: ""Okay. Is there something unusual?""      
$Client: ""There's a little red light on it.""      
$Me faintly remembers there is a red light on the login screen when the Mac server is unreachable.      
$Me: ""Can you click the red light and tell me what it says?""      
$Client: ""Network accounts unavailable""      
$Me  thinks through the options. Option 1: server crashed and failed to  restart. Severity maximum, likelihood minimum but has happened before.  Option 2: iMac is broken. Severity medium, likelyhood minimum (I tested  the internal login just before leaving in the night before). Option 3:  new Wifi router stopped working or causes network issues. Severity  maximum, likelyhood medium. I choose option 3.      
$Me talks  $Client through disconnecting the new router to restore the exact  previous state of the network. Thankfully the old router is red and the  new one is black. (""do you see the grey cable? yes there are two. No  they are not the same. You need to unplug the left one. Did you unplug  the left one?"")      
Finally, it seems like $Client managed to re-plug two ethernet cables. Whew. Let's see if iMac is happy.      
$Client: ""I've rebooted the iMac again and the red light is still here. What do we do?""      
Still  sleepy and dizzy, I try to remember what I did to the poor iMac that  could make it stop working. I remember the Wifi Hotspot test and a  suspicion arises: could the iMac still be on WiFi, possibly on an  incorrect network?      
$Me: ""Can you check if the iMac is on WiFi?""      
$Client: ""The mac is what? Wifi?""      
$Me  headdesk: ""Look at the time on the mac. At the top of the screen. Next  to it on the left is there a little symbol like a radar?""      
$Client: ""I can see a litte wavy symbol like on my phone there, yes. It's  connected. That's good, right? I don't get it. All the other computers  are working.""      
$Me pauses. Didn't $Client tell me in the  beginning that all of them were not working? Did I spend the last ten  minutes on the phone for nothing? Anyway.       
$Me: ""That's not supposed to be there. We need to turn that off.""      
The  problem: it's AFAIK not possible to change the network configuration  from macOS login screen. I'll have to let $Client login with the local  admin account to change that.      
$Me talks $Client through logging in as admin and changing the network settings.       
(...excerpt from the call:) $Client: ""What do I click?""      
$Me: ""Make active and then click Apply.""      
$Client: ""Make active. Okay. Now it says unknown state. See it's not working I told you.""      
$Me: ""Did you click apply at the bottom right?""      
$Client: ""Uh.. hold up the customer phone is ringing.""      
$Me: ""We are literally a single click away from done.""      
$Client:  ""I'm answering the other phone, one moment. (talking into other phone)  Yes. No I can't look that up right now there's a problem with the  computer. Can I call you back? I don't know. Thanks for understanding.  Bye. (talking to $Me again) Let's fix it quick now! Please!"" (...)      
Turns out I forgot to change back to Ethernet in the evening. The iMac was  set to the internal $Client WiFi, which would have been fine. But the WiFi is not set to reconnect automatically and I had put the iMac to  sleep when I left. Duh-duh. In the morning when $Client woke up the  iMac, it connected to the guest wifi network for some reason, making the  server and network accounts unavailable. In the end, it got fixed and  we had unnessarily disconnected the new router, which had been working perfectly fine.    

# Chapter 3: the fall

  
The  same evening I stop by the $Client to reconnect the WiFi router. I'm a  little bit early so there's some $Client staff left. I ask if they need  internet for the next few minutes, they say no, I swap the ethernet  cable back around.      
$Client: ""The SMS sending service is not working.""      
$Me: ""That uses the internet. It'll start working in a minute or so.""      
Enter  $Boss. He manages the $Client business and is generally a nice guy.  Though his expectations and ideas are usually wildly exaggerated.      
$Boss: ""Hey $Me what's up? The internet isn't working!""      
$Me:  ""Nice to see you, too."" I spy the router LEDs are signaling online, and  check my phone. Guest Wifi is back online. ""It's working for me, just  finished installing the new router.""      
$Boss: ""Nice.""      
$Client: ""Sorry but it stopped working again. Can you take a look?""      
$Me, puzzeled, refreshes website on phone. Indeed not loading.      
$Me: ""Seems like we have an issue there.""      
$Boss: ""Good job!"" and leaves with $Client.      
$Me burns $Boss's back with death stare and digs through the network again.  I connect the iMac to the rack router management WiFi because the  ethernet isn't getting an IP anymore. Some cursing about the awful web  interface later, I end up on the WAN failover settings page that I had  looked at the night before. It's changed and auto-detected the IP of the  new router as gateway for WAN 1, which it is NOT supposed to be! The  old router/modem is still the gateway. I change it back and it resumes  working, so I pack to leave and decide to check Twitter while I'm still  on WiFi. A few tweets download fine and then the connection drops out  again. In anger, I re-login to rack router management. The IP for WAN1  gateway has changed back to the new router. What the heck. I decide to disable WAN failover entirely, which solves the issue.

# TLDR:

  
Undocumented, needlessly complicated network setup leads to unforeseeable issues when  installing a new WiFi router. $Me gets to work extra long hours to  figure sh\*t out and earns a sarcastic ""Good job"" from $Boss.

150,Do you type that same command the same way every time?,"So... This is yet another tale of offshore sysadminning. In this case, I'm working on a seismic job. We run 20-30 lines per day, 24 hours a day. We are headed to the dock because of weather or needing parts or SOMETHING... My main jobs for this project are processing bathymetry data and making sure that ALL the data gets backed up to tape. I'm done with my part when I see our geophysicist sitting at his computer with a couple of pages stapled together laboriously typing out commands. I go over to chat. 

He tells me that he's several days behind. That he can only process 5 or 6 lines of data in a day and we are collecting 20-30 lines per day. I ask him if I can see his instructions and I realize that he is telnetted into my Unix machine running commands. Running commands typed exactly the same way in exactly the same order for every line. Probably about 10 commands. He does this for EVERY line. 

I ask him if I can borrow his sheet for a few minutes. He agrees, and I wander off to create a simple shell script that runs each of the commands in sequence and takes a line number or wildcard as input. That way, he can simply run ""Process \*"" and process ALL the lines at once. His mind is blown and within a few hours he's completely caught up. 

The next day, he asks if I can make a few changes... make it easier for him to pull up graphs, clean up intermediate files that are not needed, etc. I agree, and make those changes. This progresses/evolves over the next few weeks into a handful of individual scripts... one to process data, one just to view graphs, another to isolate traces, etc. It becomes a very handy toolbox for him, and basically adds nothing to my own responsibilities, so we are both happy. A couple of months go by and I desperately need to get off the boat for some time off. There are no other admins to take my place, so they send a programmer out and I get about 2 hours with him to cover everything he needs to know... He compliments me on giving him ALL the information that he needs, in spite of the rambling, stream of consciousness style of our meeting. While he was there, he took my collection of scripts and wrote a GUI around them. Now, instead of using wildcards, there's a file selection tool, and various command line switches are available through the use of radio buttons, pulldowns, etc. 

Basically, we accidentally created a very user friendly front end to a publicly available command line only data processing system that is very NOT user friendly. Within a couple of months, we were using it as a QA/QC tool as well as a troubleshooting tool for seismic data. We could catch problems in near real time that it typically took at seismic surveyor weeks or months to catch after the data had all been collected and sent off to a processing house. For the record, I'm no programmer.. but back in the day I was a hell-on-wheels shell scripter. LOL",False,2117,111,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
151,"Uniting Two Strangers, My Last Customer as a Tech","My last day as a call center technician ended yesterday. I got a promotion where I will be writing technical documents instead of handling customers. I had no idea what to expect from my last call, but I felt it was such a fitting representation of being a tech that I figured it would be meaningful to share.

**STORY:**

It's exactly 15 minutes until I clock out before I get a call from a tablet. 99% of the time these calls are from toddlers that are just mashing buttons. Usually you get a couple of seconds of noise in the background and then the call drops.

This was the first time in two months that I ask for a name and through the static I can hear someone on the other end actually trying to communicate. I go from thinking that my last call is just going to be a dropped call to one where I can barely make out his name or his number, but somehow through the noise I figure out that he had lost his phone after leaving it on top of his car and had called us a few minutes prior to try to locate it for him.

After getting his information pulled up, the notes tell me that the previous technician had called his lost phone and a woman picked up on the other end saying that she was willing to drive to the customer's home and give his phone to him. But the call dropped before the tech could connect them because they tried to conference a tablet with a phone line, which they should've known isn't feasible on most tablets. After that the customer called in again to get help with communicating again since it's impossible for us to call tablets back.

In the time being I learn the customer has a lot on his plate, being in the middle of a divorce he's been forgetful. I empathize with him, and we both agree that he's exceptionally lucky that someone nice had retrieved his phone.

He explained that he had no other way to communicate other than the tablet. With that known, I call his phone and speak with the woman that found it. Usually I'm not allowed to share customer information but it was my last day, I had his consent, and they weren't going to monitor my call anyway.  I manage to keep them both on the line long enough to get them to add each other on Facebook.  It was pretty liberating applying common sense over policy for once.

After that they were confident handling it on their own. I proceeded to disconnect from my system, clock out, and I took a minute to reflect on how perfect of a last call this was. By no means is it the craziest story here, but I felt that this story perfectly illustrates how completely random every call has the potential to be. They train you as much as possible, but every day there is always a one off that takes you completely off the rails of a conventional call. That's what this call basically was.

**TL;DR:** Man lost his phone, called tech support through a tablet to help him call the person that found his phone so that they can exchange Facebook information and get his phone back from her.",False,235,10,Mansmer,talesfromtechsupport
152,A helicopter what??,"Here's another story from my time working offshore. As the offshore systems administrator, I wore many hats and had many responsibilities. I setup and maintained pretty much every PC, workstation, server, switch, router, UPS, data collector, etc. on the boat. I also handled data processing for multibeam, sidescan, subbottom, magnetometer, and seismic data. I worked 12 hour days, typically either from noon to midnight or midnight to noon. On this particular hitch, I was working from noon until midnight. This was a couple hundred miles off the coast of Nigeria in 2009 or so. 

Cast of characters:

$me: me, myself, and aye

$crewman: random boat crew

$captain: captain of the ship

$support: Norwegian tech support person


I am awakened by someone pounding on my cabin door. I've been asleep for almost 4 hours. I open the door to see a somewhat panicked crewman. 


$me: What's up?

$crewman: Our helicopter lander system is down, you need to come see immediately!

$me: (blinks) What's a helicopter lander system?

$crewman: No time! Come now!

$me: (starts getting dressed while wondering exactly what I'm in for) Ok, give me a minute. 

$me: ( Heads up to the bridge )

$captain: Our helicopter lander system is not coming up. We have a helicopter on the way, but he doesn't have enough fuel to loiter more than 30 minutes. He's roughly an hour and a half out. If we can't get the system up in less than two hours, he'll have to return to base for fuel. We need to know as soon as possible if you can get the system up. (points me to a screen displaying a ""Insert system disk"" error and a beige box)

Oh boy, this is bad. I open up the box and check connections. When I do so, I see that there are two hard drives. I take both drives out plug them into another machine to see if I can see any data. I discover that the lander system is DOS based. The primary hard drive is toast, it knocks loudly but never fully spins up. The secondary hard drive has a backup copy of the lander system. YAY!! I pull a hard drive from one of our spare PC's, format it, and make it bootable. I don't remember where I managed to find a copy of DOS... I install the new(ish) primary hard drive and copy the backup data from the secondary drive. I now have the lander computer booted and the software running, so I bring it up to the bridge. Roughly 45 minutes have elapsed. I install the lander system and connect the gyro, gps, motion sensor, and weather sensors to it, but it's not showing any data from any of those systems. I tell the captain, and he's very pleased that the computer is up, but worried about the sensor data. The lander system cannot function without that data. He gives me a 10+ year old customer service card with a phone number in Norway. I call and wake someone up...

$me: Hello? 

$technican: Yes, hello? How can I help?

$me: We have a helicopter lander system that crashed. I got the machine up and the software installed, but am not getting any data. 

$technician: You will need to set up all the inputs. This would be easiest if you had the configuration file. It is named xxxxxx.cfg. Do you have it?

$me: I have one, but it appears to be blank...

$technician: Oh, that's not good. Well, we can set up each input manually.

$me: I have a helicopter inbound. I have about 30 minutes to get this system up. 

$technician: That's not enough time to manually configure. What's the name of your ship?

$me: It's the R/V mumblemumble

$technician: Great! We have your configuration file from 10 years ago, assuming nothing changed. Do you have email? 

$me: Yes... but it's very slow.

$technician: The file is only a few kilobytes, what is your email address?

$me: (gives email address)

The technician then walks me through installing and testing the configuration file and we are good to go. I'm able to inform the captain within 15 minutes of the deadline that the lander system was operational. Due to the wind and sea conditions, it took about 15 minutes to get the chopper landed, but it was inside the time window for the helicopter to be able to make it back to its base. 

TL;DR: I was woken from a dead sleep to fix a system I'd never even heard of, with a strict deadline of less than 2 hours... and pulled off a miracle.

154,Computer reboots when I *SHAKE* my desk,"This happened about 15 years ago. I built a tower computer for a friend of mine and it worked fine for about a year, but then it started having issues. One day he calls me and the conversation goes a little something like:  
  
$F: That computer you built me has started rebooting when I shake my desk.  
$Me: Wait, what? Like, you're shaking the tower?  
$F: No, when I shake my desk. It started happening once in a while but now it's happening all the time. I figured out that when I go to get up from my desk I put two hands on the front of my desk to push away from it, the desk shakes a little, and the computer reboots. Not every time, but often enough that something is wrong.  
$Me: Is the tower on top of your desk?  
$F: No, it's on the floor next to the desk.  
$Me: Is the tower touching the desk?  
$F: No, there's a couple inches between the tower and the desk to allow air flow.  
  
So I go over to his place to see what the hell is going on. The tower is, indeed, sitting next to the desk and not touching it. He shook the desk and it didn't reboot, so he shook it again a little harder and sure enough the computer spontaneously reboots. At this point I'm not sure what's going on, maybe there's a wire short in the case or at one of the I/O connectors on the back of the motherboard. So I completely unhook the tower from all of his peripherals and take it into the other room, open up the case and check all the internal wiring to make sure nothing's loose. I then  Grab his monitor but a separate keyboard and mouse and plug them all in and the tower and boot it up on the coffee table and it's fine. I even pick up the tower and give it a little shake and it's fine. I plug KB and Mouse into various USB ports and they're fine. I wiggle cables on the back of the motherboard and everything is fine.  
  
At this point I'm just scratching my head. I put the tower back, hook up all the wires, and sure enough shaking the desk causes it to reboot again. Must be a peripheral you say? Well, he didn't have anything but his mouse, keyboard, printer, network cable, and a couple unhooked USB cables zip tied to his desk for plugging in MP3 player and camera. I play with all the wires on the back of the motherboard and everything is fine. I even run an extension cord to the tower and use a different power cable, but nothing. The computer still reboots when the desk is shaken, but only when the desk is shaken.  
  
So we proceed to clear out everything on the desk so I can start checking peripherals one-by-one. As we're doing this I brush the two USB cables (not hooked up to anything, mind you) and the computer reboots. What the hell... I pick up the cables and touch the outer metal of the USB plugs together and *tink* the computer reboots. *tink* reboot. *tink* reboot. What in hell?  
  
I take a look at where those two USB lines are plugged into; one is plugged directly into one the motherboard's USB ports but the other is plugged into a PCI slot USB header (just a header, not a card/hub). So I pull the tower out to have a look at this USB header and apparently I had an older one I'd recycled into this system for him, because this older USB header used all five pins where as most headers omit the 5th pin ground used for the USB shielding. Near as I can tell the motherboard USB was grounded to the case but the header USB was grounded through the motherboard and the grounds were not level, so touching the outer shielding on the two USB cables caused enough of a jolt to make the system restart. And if this sounds like the [More Magic](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html) button that's probably because both instances were caused by the same grounding issue, although I didn't know about the More Magic story back then. The fix was for me to take out my wire cutters and remove the 5th pin grounding wire from the USB header. What really gets me is that in removing and replacing the tower I somehow managed to plug the two USB cables back into opposing USB ports.",False,288,18,ericbsmith42,talesfromtechsupport

Dispatched out to a customer's desk for a monitor swap.  Our company gives a budget every year to employees to order new computer hardware.

156,Go away or I shall replace you with a very small shell script.,"Back to my days surveying offshore... So, we were working off the coast of Japan, surveying the ocean floor looking for a good route to run a subsea fiberoptic cable. This was in 2000 or 2001. I was the systems administrator and data processor. As I've said in previous posts, I typically worked a 12 hour shift, in this case 6am to 6pm.

Part of finding a good cable route was making sure you didn't drape the cable over any cliffs, seamounts, volcanoes, etc.

We had a number of people responsible for making sure that we avoided any of those obstacles. The person running the multibeam and collecting the data was to notify the data processor (me), the client rep, the geophysicist, and the CAD guy of any obstructions as soon as they were noticed. Just as I was about to get off shift and go to bed, we noticed a cliff/ridge/fault in the realtime data. We notified the necessary people, ended the line we were collecting, and notified the bridge crew that we were going to have to do some exploration. This meant turning 90 degrees to the line we had just collected and following the ridge to find either the end of the ridge or a safe pass over/through the ridge. The client rep was asking me to process the most recent data about every 15-20 minutes. This was fine for the first 2-3 hours after my shift ended, but it was starting to get old. After 6 hours, I was getting seriously tired and worrying that I might make a stupid mistake, so I started hacking together a shell script that would:

Copy the latest data from the collection machine to the processing machine.

Clean up the navigation, motion sensor, and gps data.

Process the multibeam data using statistical filters to clean up as much noise as possible and apply the previously mentioned sensor data.

Produce a 1:10,000 scaled sun source shaded color map of the processed bathymetry.

Send that map to the color plotter for the client rep to look at.

I then wrote a graphical button that I could press to call the script and produce the map.

After a bit of testing to verify that it all worked, I notified the client rep that I needed to get some sleep and showed him how to use the ""autosurvey"" feature. I stayed up with him for another hour or so and watched him produce a few maps, much to his delight, then wandered off to bed. I managed to sleep through the night. The client rep was VERY happy with his magic button and we ended up using it here and there for the rest of the job. It did not take the place of the normal full processing required for producing the real maps, but it was enough to be able to scout for locations to move the cable.

TL;DR: Lazy data processor gets tired and writes a script to do part of his job for him so he can get some much needed sleep.",False,373,41,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
157,"Terrible Teenager Touches Tush, Thrashing The Tower","I promised I’d tell the tale of what finally broke the camel’s back and made me quit the job at the sleazy fix-it store. This is only borderline TFTS so if it sways too far from TFTS standards tell me and i'll remove it.


As I have written in previous tales I like to have a spot of femininity when I work in such a male dominated area as IT. The day this happened I was trying out a pretty cool utiliskirt a sewing genius friend of mine made for me, think a kneehigh belted skirt made from tough cargopants material with enough pockets to carry a serious doomsday-prepper’s EDC kit with pockets to spare. I won’t bore you with fashion details so let’s just say it fit in rather well with my goth-y attire I favoured back then (and still do sometimes but thats beside the point). 


Now, in the fix-it shop we had a baby project. It was simply called The Tower and consisted of a full size tower packed to the brim with the highest spec goodies available at the time. This project was the boss’ lovechild and was supposed to be his present for his son (henceforth Sleazeball McGrabbyhands) who sometimes worked hours at the fix-it shop, when he turned 18. Parts had been bought, shipped, installed, rewired and replaced with newer and better goodies serval times plus done up with enough LED lights to rival the most garish American christmas tree, all to the boss’ very specific orders. 


Now, to explain why I call my former boss’ son what I do he was the slimiest person I have ever had the misfortune of working with. Any time he was in the same room to me I could almost feel his stare burning a hole through my bust. Add to that trying to bribe any good-looking woman who came to the store with store credit to get a date, trying to cop a feel whenever he thought he could get away with it and dropping not-so-very subtle hints about what he thought women were meant for (let’s just say it didn’t have anything to do with honest work and leave it at that) and you see what I mean.


It was the day before Sleazeball McGrabbyhands’s birthday and besides dealing with a full day of actual paying work I got the dubious honour of putting the yet again torn down and modified Tower back in shape and bring it to my boss’ office for the him to prep for Sleazeball McGrabbyhands' birthday. Of course on the day The Tower absolutely needs to be finished the store was at it's busiest it had been for months. Extras were called in and Sleazeball McGrabbyhands was one of them. 


As you can imagine I was stressed out, both by legit work piling up and having to avoid/putting up with Sleazeball McGrabbyhands all day. At the end of the day when I was finally done putting The Tower back together again I picked it up, carefully balancing the heavy thing in my arms and carried it slowly from our build area towards the boss’ office. It was at this time Sleazeball McGrabbyhands came up behind me and, in his best “Tokyo subway molester” impression decided to grab a double handfull of my utiliskirt and backside. This startled me and I instinctively pushed myself away from his hands, shifting my balance enough that I lost my grip on The Tower. Down The Tower went and the horrible sound from it hitting the concrete floor made all the other techs turn to see what the frak just happened. What seconds before had been an expensive and time-consuming gaming rig project was now utter thrash. The case had smashed itself open on the concrete floor and pieces of circuitboard had spread out from it like a halo of fail and misery. I almost broke down and cried there and then. Only thing that stopped me from bawling my eyes out was my burning hate towards Sleazeball McGrabbyhands, who had decided to slink away quietly while I was staring at the remains of The Tower in disbelief. 


After sweeping up the circuitboard breadcrumbs I marched straight to my boss and told him what his good-for-nothing son had done and what it caused. Guess who my boss blamed for wrecking his son’s expensive birthday present? That’s right: Me.  
According to my boss it was all my fault. I got called some very hurtful things, told that I should have put more effort into carrying it and that I should just have let his son grab me, no question asked. 


That was it. Namecalling I can take but being told that defending myself from molestation was wrong was so above and beyond morally wrong it could be. I told my boss where he could shove the remains of The Tower and resigned on the spot, effective immediately.

We need a report from a system that the expert consultant gave up trying...","As I've said in other posts, I get to do some interesting work with SQL and people sometimes come to me after giving up all hope. This time is no different. This one blurs the line between support and development.

We are installing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system from a major vendor and at our project consultants guidance we are using a third party tool to schedule the jobs that run on this system. The reason we are using this tool is the tool is agnostic meaning it will not only run the jobs for the ERP system it will all run the jobs for the attached business intelligence and .NET applications we use to run our business.

The expert consultant spent months creating these jobs but the closer we got to production the more problems we run into. Part of the schedulers job is to determine the order jobs should run. Especially for Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) as well as all of the financial jobs. Many of these are starting to fail as jobs are starting before their predecessor completes or in some cases are just in the wrong sequence. Unfortunately to figure this out you have to go screen by screen in the application and take notes or run dozens of very rudimentary reports and then blend them together. The expert consultant says no problem he will write a report to show us all how this works. 

We hire a scheduler to take over the scheduling. 

After about eight weeks of deteriorating communication and cooperation the consultant gives us a very lame report and a bill and exits stage left.

The director and the new scheduler come to me and ask if I will take a look. (I had done some other deep reports for the director before.)

Of course I say sure why not. I give no promises as I have never worked with this application before and I could just as easily turn up empty handed.

So we ended up in an internal political struggle over access to the underlying data in an Oracle database. After resolving this issue I get to query the back end directly. But due to license restrictions I cannot have a log on to the actual application...

So I work with the scheduler. Mostly I look over his shoulder and ask questions, take notes and get him to send me screen shots.

Now I log on to the database using TOAD. One of my favorite SQL tools. The table names are mostly close enough to the screen names in the application I begin to make some progress. Looking at TOAD I discover for the first time a commercial application that uses foreign keys (for the most part) and good relational database design. Once I start finding the data from the screen shots I am able to use this to pull the threads together for all the other tables.

The biggest problem we have is that the jobs are in a hierarchy. Any level in the hierarchy can have a collection of jobs as well as another group of jobs. The groups can have groups. This goes down six levels. I look at the report the consultant wrote and he had no idea how to do recursion in SQL. Not only that he did not set up the dependencies between jobs or use the hierarchy correctly. 

The main job table has a list of all of the jobs/groups with a unique identity field, job name, system, etc.. In one of the other job tables I find a column for the same identity field of parent job/group and a column for  the identity field of the child job/group . Bingo we are in business. This is the table that controls the hierarchy.

I put together the recursive logic into a Common Table Expression and have it generate the whole job picture. Hierarchy and dependencies as well as job titles etc.

Did I mention I love TOAD? One of the things you can do with TOAD is export not only to a file but directly to an open Excel spreadsheet. So I dress up the query with aliases for the database column names and the levels of the nesting within the job schedule. Run the query, export to Excel, some quick formatting and save and send.

I send this to the scheduler and at first he is very happy but then the ""if only it did this..."" requests start. We are running this on a daily basis as he straightens out the job structure from the consultant, gets things in the right order and resets the hierarchy. The ERP application is settling down and people are beginning to trust our efforts. In the meantime I am implementing the embellishments.

The hardest one is to get the technical information from the ERP job being scheduled, which program, which version, what parameters,etc.. He sends me a screen shot and I look in the database and don't see anything that matches the screen as far as table structures etc. Long story short the scheduling application uses XML fields and an XML structure for this information. Since they support every major ERP vendor and each one has different characteristics this is for them a perfect solution.

So now I get to learn about XPath and using that to pull out data. I add this to the output and now we are very happy.

The initial report took about two weeks and the embellishments as there were many more took about another four weeks of iterative development. During that same time the scheduler is straightening out the whole schedule and we are able to go-live without this being an issue. At that time there we have over a thousand jobs to keep track of and straighten out. Now we are about double that. Fun times! Thanks for reading.",False,163,13,JustAnOldITGuy,talesfromtechsupport
159,"What do you mean, ""just make it work""?!?","As the offshore systems administrator, I was more or less responsible for every piece of electronics on the ship that was not handled by the engineering crew. The company I worked for had a very ""You can do it!"" attitude about pretty much everything. It was not unusual for me to be handed a piece of equipment I had never heard of, seen, or even knew existed and be expected to have it up and running within a few hours/days. 

In this case, we are working off the coast of Nigeria in 2009. That's around the time several ships were boarded or attacked by pirates. Just before we are scheduled to leave the dock in Ghana, a crate appears on the helipad. I'm told that it's a camera and that it's my job to get it set up and working. I've installed a few cameras in my time, so I figured it was no big deal. I was wrong...

In the crate was a roughly $70,000 FLIR waterproof **THERMAL** PTZ camera weighing about 70lbs. The engineering crew was nice enough to mount the camera on the ship's mast and run the cable down to the bridge for me. At that point, I had to finish the setup. There was a main box, monitor, and joystick. The main box required inputs from the ship's gyro, GPS, and RADAR. After a bit of tinkering, I got the main box running, mounted the display, mounted the joystick, and got a picture on the screen. The joystick controls were reversed and it took me a while to get that figured out. 

I was trying to figure out how to connect the RADAR, looking through the manuals for both the RADAR and the FLIR camera. The idea was that you could select a target on the radar and the FLIR camera would point at that target so that you could see what it was. The camera had daylight, infrared, and thermal capabilities. Theoretically, this would allow us to identify pirates before they were close enough to board us. After several hours of digging through manuals and not making any headway, I decided to call the support line of the RADAR manufacturer. What follows is a brief exchange between myself ($me) and their support technician ($support).

$support: RADAR support, how can I help you?

$me: I've been asked to slave a camera to our RADAR. I see that there is a target identification output, but I can't find that output. 

$support: Yes, if your RADAR does not have a target ID output on the back panel, then you'll have to connect some wires to the terminal strip inside the RADAR. We can have a technician come down to help you with that. 

$me: I'm afraid that this is time sensitive and that we are in a remote location.

$support: I highly recommend that you leave this to a support technician.

$me: Is there any way you could walk me through this? 

$support: I really don't think so. If you touch the wrong thing inside the RADAR cabinet, it **WILL** kill you. 

$me: Wow... ok... Well, we are 200 miles off the coast of Nigeria in pirate infested waters. When can you get a technician to me? 

$support: ... So, start by taking off the rear panel screws. You are looking for a terminal strip at the bottom right when you are looking at the back of the unit. The terminal strip is green. DO NOT TOUCH any of the capacitors or transformers on the left side of the unit. Depending on your camera, you may need an A-&gt;D board. RX goes to terminal block 3, TX goes to terminal block 2, and ground goes to terminal block 16. If you don't see target data, try reversing 2 and 3. DO NOT TOUCH **ANYTHING** inside other than the terminal strip. 


I never did get the RADAR targeting to work... we unfortunately did need that 
A-&gt;D board. ",False,295,9,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
160,"""What is a 404?""","I'm a developer now (was QA at the time), not tech support, but hopefully this still counts. A couple years ago when I was fresh outta college and starting my first job as automation QA at a medical software company, I met a guy that worked there who was genuinely the worst developer I have ever met, and still works there by some miracle.

So there I was, running a few of our automated test suites, when I saw that there was an icon that should display on a study in the grid when it has a 3D imaging view available throwing a 404. I check the source folder on the server, lo and behold, the image file is no longer there. No big deal, I log a bug in TFS, this should be a super easy fix, right? Oh how I wish it was...

$Dev pings me and asks if he can come to my desk to discuss the bug. Uh, yeah, okay, sure... but why? Just re-add the file for the next build. He comes to my desk. This is the first time I've met the guy, boy was it a trip.

$Dev: ""Hi. I see you logged a bug for 404 on this icon.""

$Me: ""Yep. You should just need to add the image back to the source folder and it'll be all good.""

$D: ""OK. What is 404?""

No fucking way. This guy doesn't know what a 404 error code is. Who the fuck are we hiring? I show him what a 404 is, spend a few mins explaining it. He doesn't get it, nor does he know how to fix this error.

$M: ""Alright, alright. Here. Let me google search an icon with the same extension."" I google up a .svg file, save it  to my local and then copy it to the server folder and rename it to the name that the product is looking for. ""See? Now it shows that new icon because it's where the product is searching for. You just need to put the actual icon file it's looking for here""

$D: ""Ohhhhh okay!""

I have now spent 20 mins teaching the developer what a 404 HTTP error code is, and shown him how to fix the bug. It ended up getting assigned to another dev cuz this guy didn't fix it.

161,The one time in this field I was afraid for my life. (A story of an awful boss and a legitimately crazy client),"Hey everyone! Long time lurker first time poster. Let me tell you a story about the time that introduced me to the worst side of MSPs and the worst of clients. 

So, I had been working at $MSP for some time. About two years or so at this point. It was a small company with 4 of us techs and two bosses. One boss $J who was our COO was one of those ""company guys"" who only really cared about our bottom line. We had a few whale clients, but with the way things were going we were hemorrhaging money since the previous owner left. $J was trying to take advantage of every source of revenue he could to keep the company above water. This was more to keep his six figure paycheck and it was obvious. 

One day we get a call in from a new prospective client. Enter $L, she seemed normal enough. And older woman who didn't know much about computers. She said she had had a falling out with her previous IT provider for her home and she was concerned about some of the equipment he had put in. (This should have been red flag number 1). I schedule a time to drive out to her place and take a look at the equipment in question and see if there is anything that needs to be done. Pretty standard house call stuff right?... Right?

A few days later I drive out to her house. Its a little cottage on a larger estate in a really affluent part of the area. $J probably saw dollar signs as soon as he saw the area code. So I pull up into their parking lot and am greeted by $L: Early 60s, 5 foot nothing, probably less than 100lbs soaking wet, and wrapped in three big shawls. She greeted me and seemed super happy to see me. ""This is gonna be easy"" I thought ""Take a look at the equipment, talk to her for a half hour or so, leave here to go directly home, awesome"". And let me tell ya, thats how this first visit ended up going. She had a computer that was custom built, a nice linksys router, and an HP wireless printer, pretty standard. She said that there was some weird behavior with the PC and that she hasnt turned it on in about two weeks. I ask if she wants me to take a look at it for her while im there. She says ""No i dont want it on in my house until you look at it, take it with you"". I say okay and pack it up in my car to bring back, thinking ""That was a little weird but whatever."" This should have been red flag number 2. 

I get the computer back to the office the next day and get it all set up and boot it up. Runs like a charm. Its a beast too! I do my usual cleanup/diagnosis. Malwarebytes picks up a few adware things and I remove them. Some popups stop coming up when you open IE and I figure this was the weird behavior she was talking about so I wrap it up to bring back over to her so she can sit with me and confirm its working to her liking. (CYCLE OF SERVICE ERRYDAY)

So I get there and $L is waiting for me with her husband, nice guy, much older probably in his mid 70s. He introduced himself and we BS'ed for a while. This is unrelated but he told me he used to be Jonny Cash's dentist, so thats pretty neat. Anyway $L greets me and goes upstairs to grab a notebook. Her husband pulls me aside and his face suddenly gets very serious. He says ""Today she is going to tell you some things that are going to sound absurd. I understand this is strange but please do your best to be as professionally normal as possible about it."" red flag 3. 

$L comes back downstairs with notebook in hand and a manila folder full of papers. She pulls up a chair next to me where I set up her computer and we turn on the PC to go through it. Here is where things start to get weird. 

I turn it on and it hits POST, because its a custom rig the BIOS message pops up due to not being disabled. Suddenly $L goes ""THERE THERE IT IS! ONE OF THE THINGS!"" I ask her what she means. ""CHUCKEY CHEESE! I CALL MY OLD IT GUY THAT, HE PUT THIS ON MY COMPUTER TO WATCH ME"". Im thinking okay this is getting a bit weird but hey shes older and technology can be scary when you dont understand it. I try to do my best with older clients to make them comfortable and happy. I explain that this is just a message the computer spits out when it turns on before it gets to Windows. I even go into the BIOS and turn it off so it just shows the mobo logo at that point. She makes a note of it in her book and we move on to Windows itself. She asks me to set up a new email account for her on gmail. I do so and set it up with her outlook and shes happy. I ask if she forgot her password to her old email or something and if she would like me to try and help recover her account. ""No thank you! Chuckey Cheese already has control of that account!"". ""Okay... did he sign you up for your own address or just use gmail or something?"" I figure perhaps this old IT guy set her up with a custom domain or something and he ran the email infrastructure for it. ""No it was gmail. He hacked my account"". This kinda conversation keeps coming up every now and then as im going through her computer with her. ""Whats that? what are you doing?"" ""Jotting down some notes for me here in notepad"" I say. ""Oh you shouldnt use notepad... Chuckey Cheese used to love that one to spy on me"" (are you seeing where this is going?). I explain everything to her as best I can. I tell her that with the setup she has now she owns everything and there is nothing malicious on her computer. She seems happy, her husband thanks me on the way out and offers me $100 as a tip. I turn it down because I like him and want to build a good client relationship. 

A few days goes by and no word from $L. Then one afternoon I get a call from her husband. $L is not happy. She is saying that all the problems have come back and that rather than trying to fix it she just wants a new PC and a new router. I ask what issues have come back and if they are sure they dont want me to try and fix them. He says he just wants to pay for the new computer and setup to make $L happy. I let $J know and he immediately orders the most expensive touch screen all in one Lenovo makes and a Dell Sonicwall firewall (because they will pay for it so $J figures why not). Everything comes in a few days later and I do the configurations at the office, and drive out to $L's to install everything. 

I get there and $L seems different. She is angry and argumentative with her husband. He is trying to tell me what she said and she shouts him down and calls him names. I'm starting to get uncomfortable. I set everything up, show her how it all works, she seems fine, and I head out. I kinda understood why she might be in a bad mood, she paid for a service and wasnt satisfied. But oh boy did everything escalate from here. 

I'm out sick about a week later and $L calls up the office. My co-worker (and good friend) $A ends up having to go over there. We are hanging out the next day at his place smoking weed and he tells me how he thinks $L is unhinged. We laugh about it and dont think too much. 

That is until next time I have to go back there. ($J wanted us to go on site there as much as they were willing to pay for, they had deep pockets and $J knew this). I get there and $L is out at an appointment. Her husband is there and he tells me that she has been saying her wireless printer has been hacked. I take a look at the setup and diagnostics and i see nothing weird. This printer is disconnected form the internet, and is used via a USB that she unplugs after she is done. I explain this to him and he basically says ""Listen I know there is probably nothing wrong, but her therapist wanted me to get a professional in here to reassure her that noone is watching her."" oh.... well.... shit. He goes on to say how she keeps taking his phone and deleting his apps saying ""they are used to spy on us you idiot!"" and things like that. He mentions that he hasnt even been able to listen to his music on Pandora because she thinks its a ""backdoor"". Thankfully he had a new car that had an app store built in. I set up pandora on his car for him so at least this poor bastard can have some tunes. We agree that this is gonna be just between us. No problem. So, $L gets back from what i then realized was a therapy appointment. She comes in with the same nice demor that she had the first visit. I show her everything that was set up, and explain to her about her printer not being attacked. 

This kinda thing keeps going on for a few more weeks and I am going out to their place now pretty much every 3 days or so. $J is charging them out the ass for this and thinks its great. I am starting to have problems with it because I realize that we are straight up taking advantage of a mentally ill person. I bring this up to $J at one point and he basically says ""Her husband is willing to pay for it so we are willing to do the work"". 

Everything started to go south after 2 or 3 months of this. $L was getting worse. I would go there and she would have stacks of diagnostic printouts from windows and her printer. Having me sit there with her for hours going line by line, asking ""well what about THIS"" pointing to some mundane system call or something. She keeps saying that ""Chuckey Cheese is back in, you said you were good at this? What is he better than you? You have to do something about this guy."" She also started to tell me over and over that their bank accounts were missing hundreds of thousands of dollars and that she was reporting it to her bank but they too were infiltrated by Chuckey Cheese and they would not help her. Her husband later pulled me aside to tell me that no, no money was missing, he had been checking his accounts regularly. $L was slipping further into her delusions. And I was getting more and more uncomfortable being there. I am a tech nerd, not a therapist, and I strongly felt we were taking advantage of her. But $J's reasoning was, ""she is paying, go there or ill find someone who will"". 

And then one day I had to go back again. $L was on one of her ""good days"" all smiles, talking about her horses, super cheery. That is until I a said ""$L, I have gone through this with you several times before, these diagnostic reports will not show you anything you need to be concerned about. We have found no evidence of any malicous stuff going on with your equipment and we have put in all our own equipment I configured myself. You can be assured that there is no-one watching you"" This set her off on a tirade. She yelled at me about how ""YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING HOW CAN YOU SAY NOONE IS WATCHING ME WHEN YOUR VIRGIN BUDDY $A IS LOGGING INTO MY COMPUTER EVERY NIGHT TO MESS WITH ME NOW ON TOP OF CHUCKEY CHEESE"" ....what? And then the part that you were all waiting for ""AND IF YOUR ASS OF A BOSS $J DOESNT GET SOMEONE IN HERE WHO CAN FIX MY PROBLEMS I AM GONNA GO GET MY GUN AND SHOOT YOU ALL MYSELF"" RED FLAGS ALERT CRAZY WITH FIREARMS IN THE HOUSE. I do my best do defuse the situation without setting her off. Saying that I will do everything in my power to get to the bottom of anything she says is going on and that she can count on me. I lied. Fuck that. I wanted to get out of there and never come back. 

So, I get back to the office and immediately go tell $J what $L said. He says something to the effect of ""Come on man, shes a frail old lady, are you really gonna be scared of her?"" ""yes. She has a mental illness and has said she has guns in the house"". He responds ""Well you have to go tomorrow to drop off this new printer for her. If you really have a problem go and take $A with you."" I am a very passive person and dont argue well with people in authority above me. So I stupidly say ""okay... ill take care of it"". 

The next day $A and I drive out to their house. Drop off the printer, and $L comes home. She is furious that $A is there. ""HOW DARE YOU BRING THAT MAN INTO MY HOUSE AFTER ALL HE HAS PUT ME THROUGH."" $A is way more assertive than me and is having none of it ""Listen Lady, I dont know what you think is going on but I have never touched your computer after I came here that one time. I dont care enough about you to mess with you. You arent being attacked, youre therapist wants us here to reassure you but if you aren't going to listen to us we have no more business here."" and we left. When we got back to the office $J was pissed. He had gotten a call from $L saying that we were horrible to her and she demanded a refund for all the months we had worked with her which had amounted to over $10k. $J said that he was so sorry and that he would be sending me back out if she was okay with it to look at any issues she was having and that we valued her as a client blah blah blah. 

At this point $A is looking out for me and knows how I am. He tells me ""Dude you have to go talk to our other boss right now. Hes a lawyer by trade and there is no way this is okay."" So I go into our other boss the CFO's office and tell him whats up. He is horrified and hasnt been told anything. Once I got to the part of the story where she threatened to shoot people he cut me off, walked me over to $J's office and said. There is no way we can let this go on. I dont care how much money we are making. Call her and tell her we are terminating her contract. $J was clearly very mad about this but he had to listen to his lawyer because they both knew that at that point I would have a promising OSHA case if i ever wanted to pursue it. 

Over the next few months after all this $J clearly had it out for me. He saw it as me loosing the company a whale. But he knew he couldnt do anything about it. It was overall a very hostile work environment after this. One day at lunch after being yelled at by $J for some unrelated thing, I put my resume up on Indeed out of spite. A few weeks later I get a call for an interview. I land it after I get the offer I go into $Js office and quit. I am now a 'nix administrator at a medium sized university and couldn't be happier. As shitty as the situation was I consider it a valuable learning experience. Now I know what to look for in a potential work environment and employer. But yeah, that was the time I thought I was gonna get shot at because a crazy thought some hacker named chuckey cheese was ruining her life.

I work for a company that has made and supports a certain CRM using an (extremely) extensive SQL database. It's pretty standard stuff though. A person has a database  record and in that record they have a name, address, contact details and a bunch of other information.

The software isn't the most intuitive thing in the world to use, but anyone who buys it can call the helpdesk anytime and make feature requests/report design requests.  We thought it might be useful to get in touch with the clients who never called. This guy (Operations Director) was one of them, and he was inches away from dropping our contract because the software apparently didn't meet his business requirements.

He would then open up the CSV on one monitor, open the database on another monitor and go through each row (those 1000 or so people) and manually type in each person's email address in a new column. He would literally sit there and flick through records on the database and go through retyping their email addresses into the spreadsheet. Every. Month.

It’s getting power and the cables aren’t loose so I tell him I need to take it apart to see if anything was done incorrectly or was loose. It was the first time he had built one so I just wanted to be safe. After taking the board out I could see that there was no thermal paste where it was supposed to be. 

But then I noticed something else wrong, there was  a small amount of paste but it was on the actual chip itself oozing out. I try to open the housing and there is a mixture of broken pins and excessive thermal paste mixed together. I wipe off a little and see that the chip wasn’t put in place correctly and I can only assume was just forced closed.  I take it back to the father and show him that it is broken and the pins are either all bent or broken off completely. 

I leave the talking down the angry customer to my boss who heard the whole thing and I put the pieces into some containers we use for loose components.

I have a user that calls in and reports that she is unable to turn her computer on. This is actually a pretty common call, and GENERALLY the solution is one of the following:


1) Make sure the computer is plugged into power

2) Make sure that the power strip or UPS is turned on

3) unplug the power cable, hit the power button a few times, then plug the cable back in. 

This case threw me off my game. 

I'll be $me and branch manager shall be $bm. Notice that this is a branch MANAGER.

$me: Helpdesk, this is me, how can I help you?

$bm: My computer won't turn on. 

$me: Okay, is this a desktop or laptop?

$bm: Desktop

$me: Okay, is the computer plugged into a power strip?

$bm: No, it's plugged directly into the wall. 

$me: Can you verify that the power cable is both firmly plugged into the wall and firmly into the back of the PC? 

$bm: Yes, it's plugged in on both sides. It was working fine this morning. 

$me: Okay, I'd like for you to unplug the cable from the back of the computer and while that cable is unplugged, go ahead and hit the power button a few times then plug the cable back in. 

$bm: I can't do that. 

$me: Do you have an injury that prevents you from crawling under the desk?

$bm: No, it's too dark.

$me: ... too dark? 

$bm: Yes, the lights are out.

$me: **headdesk** Ma'am? I'm afraid your computer requires electricity to operate. Have you notified facilities maintenance? Is the whole branch without power? 

$bm: Yes, the whole branch is dark. 

$me: Please stay on the line while I send out notices that your branch is down. 
$bm: You mean we can't work? 

$me: ... not without power, no... do you know who your power provider is? 

$bm: no

$me: no problem, I can find that information and try to get an ETA from the power company. I see your cell number is xxx-xxx-xxxx?

173,Bad Idea,"I work for in tech support for a company that has a few programs that are installed all over the US and we service all of their calls and chats. This one was via chat.

I was trying to help a guy log into our iOS app. He was unable to and I suggested various methods to fix, such as resetting his WiFi, restarting his iPhone etc. none of those worked.

So next thing we suggest is to uninstall and reinstall the app. I told him that and his response was,

BAD IDEA. 

I explained this is normal procedure for this type of scenario. He wants me to walk him though it, so I tell him to hold his finger on the app and wait for it wiggle and click the X to uninstall. 

He says, DONE. 

Next I say go to the App Store and type in “our program”. He says, I don’t have that. Shocked at the fact all iPhones have the AppStore on them, I told him to look for the app icon that has a blue capital A. He says I don’t see it. I then tell him how to swipe down to get to the search area on top and type in App Store. 

He says, you mean safari? 

Now I know this guy does not know what he is doing. I tell him to swipe right a couple times and he will be in a area where he can search for the app on top. 

He says, didn’t work. 

My last idea is for him to hold down the button and have Siri pop up and for him to just say, App Store! He said he does not have Siri. I have tried 3 different methods for him to find it and I give up. I advise to have him reach out to Apple since he is missing his App Store icon.

Of course, I called my On-Call who gently reminded me of maintenance. I internal message the maintenance admin. 

Me: Hey, uhhh did you just blow something up on accident?

Admin: I think I might have.

Me: This was just moving a node from one ring to the other?

Admin: Yeah.

Me: Well, we have no TV service, no security cameras. I don't know what else is affected.

Admin: Oh no.

Fast forward 35 minutes. E-mail comes in: Door Unlocked at DC - User: Boss Man. 5 minutes later, here comes my instant message. 

Boss Man: Hey, I heard and drove as soon as I could up to help. Looks like we overloaded the main router as well as egress. I'm working on it!! It looks like Admin might have made a mistake and made a loop with routing.

After an hour and a half, and the 3 main admins and myself sitting in a group IM conversation, I sent out the ""Resolved"" e-mail.  Boss man came down to visit with me in my office. He left at approximately 2:00 - 2:15 AM. About 5:30 I start seeing tickets coming in. Customers from the moved node not having service. I instantly inspected the first ticket. No IPs. ""Well, crud,"" I thought to myself and grabbed my phone and dialed Boss Man. 

Groggily he answers, ""Hello?""

Me: ""Sorry to wake you sir, but I need to pick your brain.""

Him: ""What's going on?""

Me: ""Customers on XXX are not getting an IP. XXX  &amp; XXX VLANS are affected.""

Him: ""Ok, I'll look at it and e-mail you a quick fix, but we should probably have a conversation about what constitutes an emergency.""

I was flustered, and embarrassed at this point. My spidey senses were tingling and I knew this was not a singular occurrence. Less than 5 minutes later an e-mail comes in from Boss Man telling me to switch to a different VLAN. I do as asked and instantly the IPs resolve. I respond to him that yes, it was definitely a fix. He e-mails me back saying he had to make a change in a router then. 

By this point, I am seeing the tickets beginning to roll in. 3, 4, 5, I have no idea how many customers are affected and I'm worried that they would have had hundreds before 8 am. He e-mails me back again saying it should be fixed. I check accounts that I knew had already came in and breathe a sigh of relief. I continued to monitor them for a few minutes. I respond back to him ""I'm so sorry to wake you, I was just positive this was a bigger scope issue."" He e-mails me back, ""I'm so sorry I was short with you, after I woke up and really started thinking I realized this was a bigger issue.

I text her the password and PIN, just in case Windows ask for the PIN. I thought my job was done. But I was so wrong.

My mom got on the PC, and the PC freezed. This was normal, as our computer is not very fast. But it then showed some errors of whatever type, so my mom called me again.

176,"""My contacts are all gone!""","My mom has been having some tech-confidence issues the past few years, so more and more often I am having to talk her through very basic things that she used to know how to do. I think I've tried teaching her to use the microphone icon to use talk to text literally 100 times and she still forgets. She also calls me to Google traffic updates for her even though I put the Navigation app on her home screen. 

So, the past few years she's been complaining that her gmail address she's had for over a decade doesn't match her married name. She finally started migrating to her new one which likely means I will be in hell for the next 2 years each time she needs to go to a website to update her email address. 

A few months ago she calls me in a panic, 

Mom: ALL MY CONTACTS ARE GONE!!!

Me: It's fine, Mom, they're still stored in your Google account (talks her through importing them)

This happens every few weeks for months and I finally tell her to give me the phone. I look and her contacts are there, so I do an import just in case she's accidentally updated a contact while logged into her old account and then couldn't figure out why it's not saved to the new one. She's getting more and more frustrated that her contacts keep disappearing. 

Finally, yesterday I spend over an hour on the phone with her walking her through how to import contacts. This  takes ridiculously long because she's told me the problem is with her phone so I'm using my phone to describe where icons are. After the third or fourth time of her getting frustrated because she can't find things where I say they are, I think to ask,   


Me: Are you on your phone or computer?

Mom: I'm on my computer. 

Me: I thought you were having issues with the phone?

Mom: No, I just want my contacts. 

Me: OK, here's how you get to your contacts...

Mom: Why aren't they on my phone? 

Me: Seriously, they are I restored them to your phone a while ago. Are you accidentally logged into your old account?

Mom: No, I'm in the right one, but I can't remember the email address.

I talk her through getting into contacts again and ask if the person she's trying to email is there. Yes, they're in her phone, but she needs them for the computer. So at this point, I have no idea what the issue is. I once again explain how to open a contact. Realizing that we've done various forms of this for over an hour, I finally wise up and ask,   


Me: What are you trying to do? 

Mom: I need to email Beth. 

Me: OK, hit compose

Mom: I can't remember her email address. 

Me: Well you can click on the address in the contact or just start typing her name. 

Mom: What do you mean? 

Me: You're in the email, right? 

Mom: No, I don't know her address!

Me: Hit compose *(I explain where it is)* 

Mom: OK, but I don't know her email address.

Me: Just click on To: and type her name, Mom.

Mom: OMG, I didn't know you could do that!

$DU = dumb user

A few weeks ago I was assigned a job at their main office (30-40 users) to help reconnect 4 client PCs that have been moved from their branch office that they've now closed permanently. They had already packed (poorly) all the devices, monitors, cables, peripherals in boxes and plastic shopping bags and everything bundled in the corner of the main office ready for me unpuzzle. Not all the PCs and monitors were the same brand/model and users being users -  they don't like change. So they MUST and INSIST on having the exact same device they were using in their old office.

&gt;$Me: OK I'll setup $DU's computer first, do you know which one's yours? (*Points to the pile of devices in the corner).*  
&gt;  
&gt;$DU: It should be the one in the box with X mark on it. (*Whilst busily reorganising all the paper files and folders on her desk).*

I find that the monitors and towers (no cables attached) have been boxed up and packed as a set together, anything smaller like keyboards and mice were all jumbled into spaghetti junction elsewhere.

I pull out the box she described and it only contained a monitor.

&gt;$Me: (*Pulls out the monitor and showing the empty box)* Excuse me DU, but where is the rest of your computer?  
&gt;  
&gt;$DU: What do you mean? That *IS* my computer (*pointing to the monitor I just pulled out).*  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: (*Double checks it's not an AIO PC) Erm...* no, this is just your monitor that displays your PC. Your actual computer should look something like that (*points to another monitor-tower set).*  
&gt;  
&gt;$DU: Oh! of course! It's here, I'm using it as my footrest! (*chin-points down below her desk whilst her hands shuffle more papers*).

I look below and see the tower on the floor on it's side and what made me facepalm was not that she was using it as her footrest but I could see smooth side of the case on top where she rested her feet which could only mean...      dun dun DUNNN : the air vent side was faced down on the carpet.

Realised this is how she had her tower positioned in her old office, I spent the next 15 minutes explaining why this is a no-no and jokingly said

&gt;$Me: Yes, your PC will heat up and explode, blowing your feet apart if it doesn't get proper air-intake.  
&gt;  
&gt;$DU: I guess I'll have to use something else as a footrest then...

I finish connecting everything for her and login to make sure all the local printers are mapped and double check she can access this and that blah blah - usual checks.

""An arrow.""

""An arrow?!""

So I asked her, if she sewed. She delightfully said yes! She told me about all the things that she had made and about her sewing machine. I then asked if her sewing machine came with a foot pedal, she said yes. I furthered inquired if her computer also came with a foot pedal, she said yes but she needed to get another one because it was too small for her foot. She thought if she moved it around, it made the computer go, since when it moved the computer screen come on. I had to explain about how her ""foot pedal"" was really a mouse, she then said ""Wait! Mouse where?"" I had to mute her to keep from laughing. I spent about an hour going over how to use her mouse and what it was used for.

U - Everything, (he chuckles, I'm thinking this might not be a bad call) I can't print, they have changed all my stuff when i wasn't here, none of this stuff matches up, I have a direct printer and i can't print.
(now i can tell by the voice this man is older, senior for sure.)

M - They changed your computer? or was it your printer?

U - Nothing matches up, i have a direct printer and can't print, they seem to come over here and take what they want and leave when they don't want.

M - Who keeps taking this stuff?

U - They have contractors in here all the time taking what they want.

M- There are contractors stealing equipment? have you called security? (i knew this wasn't the case an never pressed it again)

U - None of this stuff matches up, it's changed since Friday.

M - Can i have the number of your PC (all PC's, printers etc. have asset #'s) (he started to read the numbers, stopped half way through and stated reading the numbers over again and he changed a few, I had to have him start over)

U - then I have this number ****** oh and i also have this number *****

M - What are these numbers for? you gave me 3 different numbers but didn't tell me what they were for. ( I had to read them back and he had to tell me what they were for)

U - I can't login, and i can't print, all of this stuff doesn't match up.

M - Can you login for me.

U - I'll try but i can't login.

U - I can't get clocked in, I'm probably not even clocked in and I've been here since 5am. (it was 9am so he was doing nothing for 4 hrs)

M - Can you try printing, so we know it works.

U - I can't get clocked in, it says user not found ""I'm sitting right here""

M - Are you able to print now?

U - I have nothing to print, and i can't get clocked in still. Yeah i was able to print Friday and they changed all this stuff, the contractors are here hooking up AC in the washrooms, I think i need a janitor or something.

183,Is it Satanic?,"I work with my dad for his consulting company, specifically I am the support for a private K-12 Christian school and have been there for about a year now. I personally am an Atheist but it has not bothered me as most of my coworkers (not all of them) are very nice and our discussions focus on the tech problems they're having, not relating to religion. There are some though that I just know are Evangelicals, and some of them are quite crazy. One older lady is convinced that her computer is possessed by a ghost named Pepe because it asks her to change her password every 3 months to login (Active Directory setting) and sometimes the computer freezes or crashes (Old computers from 2006). That's a story for another time, though.

This story focuses around someone who we will refer to as **AD**. Last semester, she was an activities director for the students and organized the retreats they took, she also taught some middle school classes and was on a 4-person tech team that is only there to ask us for help and to install certain extensions on the Chromebook devices that the students have. Last semester she was not too involved with our work, this summer she was promoted to the I.T Director and works alongside us now but she has no background in PC repair or Network Administration, her only qualification is using domain apps and teaching other teachers how to use those domain apps. 

The school has a 1:1 Chromebook program, and they did not purchase any accidental repair, is this sounding like a disaster to you guys? Because it is. Anyway, there is no accidental repair warranty so as you can imagine we are left to fix them. I'm only allowed to work 10 hours a week and of course I still had to deal with user issues and changing projector bulbs while fixing the Chromebooks in my office. The students were extremely irresponsible with them, when we first got the account we had to fix 60 that students had broken from the last year and nobody repaired because they thought they had accidental warranty because of a lack of communication between the former I.T director and the administrators of the school

When school was in session, we had at least 3 broken chromebooks come in a week usually with broken glass on the screens because they dropped them or did some other stupid thing with them. I fixed them as fast as possible, and never got asked about my progress or anything by the High School tech team leaders, but AD was always pushing for more Chromebooks to the middle school. She would text me or ask me if I had any repaired Chromebooks on the daily, and would invite me into her office and discuss things relating to teachers needing tech help in the middle school. This annoyed me because she always took up my time when I could be fixing things instead of putting in a request like everyone else, but my dad said I was doing what I was supposed to be doing and she would always give me soda when I went into her office.

One day, AD texted me and asked me to come in her office because of a Chromebook problem she was having. I went over there and let myself in, she was on the phone with someone and talking about something unrelated when I came in. After she hung up the phone, this is the conversation that followed.

**AD:** Okay, I am having a BAD day today.

**Me:** Alright, what's going on?

**AD:** This student was looking at spam advertisements on his computer! We saw them on there, how is he getting them?

We do not have any filtering software, just a firewall and Google settings to protect kids from seeing anything bad on the internet. They can see anything they want when they bring the Chromebooks home for the day.

**Me:** Okay, well it could be that he got onto a website with advertisements that wasn't filtered through the firewall, or maybe it's a bad extension.

**AD:** Oh my god you have to help me. That's not the only thing, look at this.

She takes the Chromebook and turns it to face the screen towards me. I see on there a Spotify album that the student had opened and was listening to in class. The album was ""Demon Days"" by Gorillaz.

**AD:** How did he get onto this website!? He is listening to this album called DEMON DAYS by the Gorillaz! It's like.. Satanic!""

I had trouble keeping my sides from not launching into the next hemisphere. I love Gorillaz and used to listen to them all the time. I decided just to tell her what I was going to tell her originally, that I will fix this.

**Me:** Okay, I will look at it for you. Maybe there is a bad extension or something and I can clean it up.

**AD:** Oh, can you you? Thank you. These students are driving me crazy!

**Me:** I used to listen to this band. It's not Satanic music, it's just electronica rock. 

**AD:** Oh, you used to listen to them? It's just very scary to see a child looking at these things. Can you please help me?

**Me:** Sure, hand me the Chromebook and I will take care of it.

Needless to say, nothing was wrong with the Chromebook, all the student had done was go onto Spotify to listen to music. I took a look at it and uninstalled a few personal extensions that the student had installed, did an operating system wipe, and gave it back to her.

**TL;DR** Student at a private Christian school was listening to the album Demon Days on his laptop. A tech team teacher thought it was satanic music and freaked out and enlisted my aid. I exorcised the Chomebook for her and it is now free of demons.",False,87,19,1D10TError404,talesfromtechsupport

185,No! Don’t touch that! It can catch fire for all I care!,"My company used to use a recruiting agency for finding IT people. (We still do, but we used to too.) As a result, not everybody we hired was capable of keeping up with the rest of the team, to put it nicely. This is a story of one such person. 

This guy, who I’ll call $cable, was hired as a field tech for a remote region. With a very impressive resume professing over 20 years of IT experience, he should have been more than qualified to be a field tech. Sure, he couldn’t spell to save his life, despite claiming to have plenty of tech writing experience, but surely his technical skills were up to par!

Alas, we found otherwise on one fateful day where I had to have him move a firewall from one modem to another. See, we tend to expand through acquisition, and on occasion we acquire a company that shares their office space with another company on certain days. We cannot work with this arrangement, so we tend to install all our own equipment in parallel: we order a dedicated internet circuit, new PCs, printers, phones, the whole shebang, then set it all up alongside existing equipment, using KVMs as necessary. This particular site I had learned of the shared arrangement too late, so I hadn’t had time to order a dedicated circuit quite yet and had to improvise. Being that $cable hadn’t yet been hired when this site needed to be set up, I ended up personally flying out and doing the initial setup. Since $otherCompany had a very basic setup, I ended up recreating their IP scheme on a separate VLAN on our gear and using our gear exclusively for the time being. Once our dedicated circuit was installed, all $cable would need to do is plug our gear into the new circuit, plug $otherCompany’s firewall back into their modem, move their switch back to their firewall, and all would be well. Simple!

As part of the original setup, each company did already have their own phones— ours were powered by a small 8 port PoE switch sitting on top of the rack, separate from the non-PoE switch for the rest of the gear, and $otherCompany’s were powered by power bricks connected to the individual phones. As part of the transition, we put in our own 48 port PoE switch, so we no longer needed the original PoE switch but I left it in place since it wasn’t technically ours (these split offices can be a bit messy in terms of equipment ownership). So after the transition, we had a 3U rack with the 8 port PoE switch sitting on top, our [very distinctive-looking silver switch that rhymes with $herHockey](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8zl8mr/if_it_sounds_impossible_its_probably_exactly_what/e2k3dee/?context=1) in the top U, our $herHockey firewall sitting right below that, and $otherCompany’s switch on the bottom. The two modems and $otherCompany’s firewall were mounted to the wall. 

My conversation with $cable went something like this: 

$huta: so first off, move the WAN cable coming from our firewall into the new modem. 

$cable: which is our firewall?

$huta: the silver $herHockey one. 

$cable: the one that says $GetNear?

$huta: no, that’s $otherCompany’s, and it’s black. The silver one, in the rack. 

$cable: oh, got it. And which cable do I move again?

$huta: the one plugged into the “internet” port. 

$cable: I don’t see an “internet” port. 

$huta: well, what do you see?

$cable: there’s a whole bunch of cables coming out, and there’s like... 43 ports? Oh no wait, it says 48. 

$huta: that’s the switch. Look for the little silver box right under that. It should have 4 ports on it. 

$cable: I see a box with 8 ports?

$huta: no, that’s the old PoE switch. We don’t need that. There should be nothing plugged into that. 

$cable: so I should unplug the cable I plugged in there?

$huta: wait, what did you plug into that?

$cable: the Internet cable?

$huta: which Internet cable? We didn’t disconnect any internet cable yet. 

$cable: the $ISP guys gave me a new Internet cable!

$huta: no, we don’t need that cable. There should be enough cables there already. Please unplug it. 

$cable: okay!

$huta: now, do you see the little silver $herHockey box? The cables go in the back of it, not the front. 

$cable: oh yeah, I see it! The one mounted to the wall?

$huta, getting frustrated: no, that’s $otherCompany’s firewall. Look on the rack, between the two switches. It’s sitting right on top of $otherCompany’s switch. 

$cable: oh yeah, okay, I got it. Now what do I do?

$huta: find the cable going into the “Internet” port, trace it to the modem, and unplug it. 

$cable: but it goes to the switch?

$huta: did you trace the one in the Internet port, or port 1? 

$cable: oh, I got the port 1. But it goes to port 48 on the switch?

$huta: yes, as it should. Just leave that one alone. 

$cable: so I move the Internet cable to the new modem?

$huta: correct. 

$cable: okay, done. Hey, it’s not working? It’s just showing a red light?

$huta: give it some time to pick up the new IP address. 

$cable: it’s still broken. 

$huta: what did you plug it into? 

$cable: the modem on top of the rack. 

$huta: the modem is on the wall, not the rack. The only thing on top of the rack is the old PoE switch. We don’t need that. 

$cable: oh, ok. Done. Okay, now what?

$huta: unplug $otherCompany’s switch from port 3 on our firewall and plug it into their firewall. 

$cable: which port should I plug it into?

$huta: the one marked “LAN.”

$cable: there’s none marked “LAN.”

$huta: there should be. What are the ports labeled?

$cable: they’re just labeled 1 through 8.

At this point, what should have been a 10 minute conversation had turned into an hour and ten minutes, and we were only barely closer to finishing than when we had started. And still, here we were discussing the useless PoE switch yet again! Beyond frustrated, I finally yelled at $cable the title of this post, much to the amusement of my colleagues. 

Fortunately, that outburst seemed to finally startle him enough to start doing some critical thinking, and we got the 10 minute job done in *only* another 30 minutes. I reprogrammed our gear in 5 minutes, tested, and went home for the day, as at that point it was well past quitting time. 

As for $cable? I’d love to be able to say that I was able to bring this incident, as well as countless others involving both myself and other colleagues, to my boss as reasons he shouldn’t be on our team. And I’d love to say those incidents did ultimately lead to his firing. And I can! He was let go about two weeks after this incident. Sometimes, there is indeed justice in this world.

186,How I broke their phone,"Ok, I work with fairly unique and specialised technology and support a wide range of users but I need to be clear, phones are just not my thing.  I don't know much about them and am not employed to need to.

It was therefore something of a surprise when my manager decided to boast to the head of our HR that I could change his phone to sync to our company's exchange server - it was a few years ago now and for reasons I don't know our IT hadn't deployed it by default with the company phones leaving staff to sync via cables.  Of course, someone with a work phone could have just asked IT to set them up, another source of surprise when I was told to do so.

Anyway, I popped up to HR and had a look.  It was an old iPhone (the second time I had even touched one) but I fumbled through the basic settings and found where to enter the Exchange server address and such.  The sync worked.

I then gave it back to the manager and said it would sync automatically.  In fact I said it should ONLY be sync'ed remotely.  I said this several times, stressing the importance of the concept and that things could go wrong if he tried sync'ing using the computer.  I don't think I could have been clearer had I tattooed it onto his forehead.

Now, as any of you real support people are already guessing, I got a call the next day that I had broken the phone and needed to fix it.  When I got there to check I found that all the emails and appointments were duplicated.  

I asked when it had happened, and of course the answer was ""Just after I plugged it into the computer and sync'ed"".  

""But I said not to!""

""Well yes, but I'm used to doing it this way so I thought I would try.  Now, since you broke everything how are you going to fix it?""

Now, the problem was not only duplicates, but as my city had recently experimented with daylight savings one if each appointment was 1 hour out.  And we are talking about a long term senior HR manager of a very large company, there were emails and appointments stretching back years, even months and years into the future, many required for formal records.  Thousands and thousands of them.  And it had gone both ways, the network account also had the duplicates so we couldn't just wipe the phone.

It was about that time that I remembered that I was not employed to handle such problems, that he had breached IT policy by making me do the job in the first place, and as HR manager he should be very aware of all of this.  He had also gone explicitly against my instructions.  So, in a moment of rare bravado I said ""Sorry, no idea, I'm not a phone guy.  Obviously.  I better get back to my real work.""

The one person I feel sorry for was his secretary, who apparently spent the next two weeks manually checking everything and trying to clean the account up.  The manager was too worried about push back from IT to ask them for real help (who I expect could have fixed it in a day).

I say apparently as I never spoke to him again.  My manager also never volunteered my phone services to anyone.  Personally I consider this a win.",False,308,11,the_pun_life,talesfromtechsupport
187,Be Careful what you ask for.,"Note: I know im not a great writer but every now and then i enjoy stretching that particular muscle, so bare with me and my less than amazing skill with written words.

Background: I work in a data center, we used to have a problem with customers removing machines from the floor so they stopped having to pay for the space, but leaving cables in place. This caused a lot of congestion and general annoyance for running new plans. From the customers point of view, why bother paying for the cables to be removed when we don't have anything there anymore. So a while back rules changed, now for any machine decommission we have to have a work order to remove all the cables attached to that machine. Generally works great until....

Customer submits a ticket, no idea why they thought this was a good idea, to remove all the cables from some machines they were decommissioning. So our team immediately spots the problem and goes back and forth with various levels of management and even the customer getting a LOT of CYA emails from various people saying essentially 'Do it'. 

Instead of removing the cables as requested it gets turned into a scream test (disconnect everything and see if anyone screams), everyone moves on with their night and all is quiet... for a few hours... then the screaming begins. 

The techs, in their peculiar sense of humor disconnected the cables from the server side. This is relevant because the switch side of the cables are labeled 'port 1' 'port 2' etc with the switch name. While the server side the cable goes into onboard ethernet port 2 but is labeled prod (or something equally unhelpful for correlating to an actual port (for some reason we let customers give their ports fancy names that only ever mean anything to the people that have to log into the servers)). So when the screaming started we gave them an email with the equivalent of a blank look and said in order to reconnect the cables we would need a diagram, much frantic searching and waking up of people on the customers end and no diagram is forthcoming. So we had to brute force it, since nobody knew exactly what had previously been connected where, many techs were on a conference call with the customer and would go out in shifts (coming back to the office to charge their cell phones) and plug a cable into different ports until something came up and started working. 

The ticket was worked around 9pm, the screaming started around 1:30 am, and everything was wrapped up by 5pm the next day.

For those that have not guessed what happened, the customer was decommissioning several virtual machines, someone saw the mandate for complete cable remove for decommissions and issued the ticket to remove all cables from all of their servers. Effectively bringing down their production network instead of the virtual machines that were being removed. 

The result: we were congratulated, not just for the efficiency with which we brought their network down, but with how professional and how hard we worked with them to bring it back up. Amazingly the person who created the ticket retained their job. ",False,326,15,SirDianthus,talesfromtechsupport

I am a field support coordinator for an in-house IT department of a regional grocery chain.  We had some bad ice storms over the winter, and I was on standby for a store whose front end went down hard during one of those storms.

I get to the store and I can hear the controller alarms from the sales floor.  I open the computer room and find that the AAC (ancient air conditioning unit) had failed, and the roof had opened up over the server racks, pouring water on the equipment.  Luckily, this store’s management followed orders very well.  Within minutes, the rack door latches were off, air movers in the rear of the racks, and thick plastic sheeting was over the racks like a poncho.

We only lost the primary front end controller to water damage, but the failover to the backup never happened.  I worked with the software vendor to complete the failover.

189,Very hot server room,"/u/Tech_Witch’s story from earlier today about hot server rooms reminded me of my own ordeal. I worked for a surveillance system integrator as their lead architect, which means that I designed the surveillance systems on paper and then helped during the install. I also was brought in at times for advanced support. Some of our major customers were casinos, which we had 4 under active support contracts.

Some important information for this story:

\-Casinos here get very large fines and have to shut down if the surveillance system is ever offline or cameras not recording.

\-By law, the surveillance system has to be on an airgap network to the rest of the casino so there is no remote monitoring or notifications.

\-Each camera is recorded by two completely different servers in different racks.

\-Each rack has separate A and B power, which is on different breakers and different UPSs for up time.

\-The amount of equipment in the server room has just about doubled from the initial install. There were about 30 Dell PowerEdge 2950 servers and about 14 SCSI connected 24 bay SATA storage arrays.

\-The server room has its own air conditioner, which was way oversized originally, but still sized properly after the new hardware was added.

One afternoon in 2008/2009, I get a phone call that the surveillance system is popping up errors from some of the servers. Multiple errors simultaneously always means a big problem so I’m in the car within seconds of hearing this, being about 10 minutes away. The director of surveillance then opens the door to the server room to look at the LCD screens on the servers and storage to read errors out to us on the phone, as he has been trained to do before. When he opens the solid door, heat billows out of the server room like he just opened a huge oven door. As soon as I hear this, I floor my car and go as fast as it can go, speed limit be damned, and get there within 5 minutes.

As soon as I get there, I take charge and start barking orders. I try to open the racks, but the metal racks are too hot touch. Every fan in every server is going full blast and I’ve noticed that I have lost one leg of power on one rack completely. Come to find out, since so much equipment has been added since the initial design, all of the racks are just about at their power maximum and we have already blown one breaker (the added fan power from spinning so fast was pushing it over the top). I send an employee to the power room with the instructions to find the popped breaker, flip it back over, and do the same for any future breakers that pop during this ordeal. I yell for maintenance to bring all of their carpet drying fans and as they are bringing them in, they also find work gloves which lets me get the doors off the front and back of the racks. The servers and storage arrays are all beeping from errors, and the temperature displayed on the front of the storage arrays said 99’C, which I’m guessing is the highest it would go. As I’m removing the doors, I notice one entire rack of servers go out. The guy in the electrical room has now been flipping breakers back on every 1-3 minutes now and it seemed that both the A and B legs blew at the same time before he could flip them back. Looking over, a small sign of relief as it was a rack of backup servers. The servers start powering back up and are reinitializing as we finally have all of the doors off and we have the carpet fans shooting directly into the racks at full speed. The noise of fans and air moving and heat was actually nauseating. I also have some of those carpet drying fans shooting air in and out of the room to try to normalize the temperature with the hallway.

The main server room for the casino is not too far away, so I yell for maintenance to find air ducting that I knew was being stored from the casino retrofit and pipe half of the AC from the other server room into this one just to get some cool air in there. By this point, I have the director of the casino, the director of surveillance, DBPR (Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation), FDLE (Florida Department of Law Enforcement), and countless other people I didn’t know asking me for status updates every minute. To the best of my knowledge at that point, every camera had been and still was recording on at least one server.

I then sit down at a workstation and start doing a damage report. 3 servers completely offline, not bad considering. I DRAC into each them and they will not post at all. Breakers were still blowing, but at a slower rate. Things were calming down a bit as I started moving record jobs around to handle the 3 dead servers and the AC guys were on site to get the unit going again.

The final damage was 3 full servers and about 10-12 750GB hard drives. Since the storage arrays were all configured as RAID60 and the servers as RAID6, there was no data loss and we did not have a primary and backup go offline at the same time. The batteries for the RAID controllers in both the servers and storage arrays all had to be replaced as well since they had all swelled up. Overall, though, I really couldn’t have asked for a better outcome.",False,815,135,subrosians,talesfromtechsupport

$tech - this is our other tech, a level 3 who wouldn't normally be bothered with tickets like this, but I was at a client site and well, when we are short....

191,All hot and bothered in the server room,"Had a chat with an old colleague yesterday and I was reminded of this tale.   
This takes place back in 2013. I had finally had it with the sleazy attitude at the fix-it shop (another tale for another time) and gotten a job at a server monitoring and maintenance firm. Not exactly what I studied at university but at least it beat flipping burgers like some of my former classmates were doing at the time. I was still very much a bumbling greenhorn scrambling to stretch what little of my university education that could be called server knowledge to fit a job description focused exclusively on server knowledge when this happened.   

  
It’s mid July and the heat has drivven us unlucky few not on vacation to beg, borrow and steal every fan we can get our hands on to keep the office somewhat bearable. Well there i was, sitting in my fortress of fans when the monitoring software threw up a big ALERT notice. One of the 24/7 uptime servers we monitored for a local client was throwing a hissy fit and not responding to ping. After a quick round of rock, paper, scissors that I lost I had to leave my precious cool office and head out to see what was causing the server to misbehave.   

  
One car ride across town later and I found myself at a small building in the business park just outside town. I was met by a security guard that told me he had been called out by the client ITVP to let me in, since everyone working there was on vacation. He let me into the building and after some searching we found the server room, complete with a door that wouldn’t be out of place in a high-security prison.   

  
When the guard opened the server room door it was clear as day why the server was acting up. The wave of heat that billowed out from the server room was like opening an oven on full blast. The cooling system had clearly taken a vacation with the rest of the employees and left the poor server stewing in its own heat.  
After disabling the door alarm and helping me prop up the door with a chair the guard left in search of someplace cool and I dug in to try and coax the cooling system to life again. My very basic troubleshooting of course couldn’t cut it and I resorted to plan B: moving the few portable fans in the foyer to the server room to blow out the heat. 


The fans were the kinda expensive (back then) rotating tower type that blew out air in a vertical line instead of the usual circular fan head. First fan in place and I quickly realised this was going to be a uphill battle. The fan didn’t as much blow out the heat as just churn it around. As I was moving in the second fan my hands were already slick with sweat and slipping on the smooth plastic covers. I must have bumped the chair holding the door when I was wrangling in the second fan and trying to not bash it up or drop it, because when I managed to get the fan into the server room I heard the door slam shut and lock behind me. And the only one around able to open was the guard, who was out of earshot somewhere else in the building.  

  
Well, shucks.   

  
Luckily enough I had cellphone signal in the server room so I called one of my coworkers at the office and told him what had happened. After the laughter had stopped he promised to head over to find the guard and tell him to let me out. It was only after I ended the call I realised something bad. The heat was building again, slowly but surely. The fans I plugged it wasn’t up to scratch cooling down a open foyer, not to mention a closed server room, and I made a rough guess how long the server would survive in the building heat. The number I came up with was not a not very reassuring number.  

  
**T MINUS 60 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  

  
I shifted the fans to blow directly towards the server and put them on the highest setting. Nothing more I could do now but wait for my coworker to drive over and let me out.   

  
**T MINUS 30 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  

  
I checked my phone. 30 minutes had passed since I spoke to my coworker and he promised to fetch the guard. I was sweating all over now and wished i had brought water with me. In a effort to cool down somewhat I stripped down to my underwear, as my shirt and pants were already soaked enough with sweat that I imagined I could squeeze it out. Bra and panties are pretty much the same as a bikini, right? And bikinis are summerwear, right? So I was still dressed decently for summer, at least in my mind.  

  
**T MINUS 20 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**    

  
I felt I couldn’t wait any longer. I called the office and got another coworker on the line. I asked if we could break the 24/7 uptime and shut the server down instead of having it melt itself, and me with it, to slag. He said he would text me the commands I needed to gracefully shut it down and  he would square it with the client later. 

  
**T MINUS 15 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  

  
*PLING*  
I grabbed my phone and hastily read through the message. There was a lot of commands needed to shut everything down without the server loosing its mind completely. I propped my phone up near the keyboard and went to work.

  
**T MINUS 10 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  

  
I must have looked like every teenage nerd’s dream when my coworker and the guard eventually opened the door. There I was, wearing only my underwear, glistening with sweat and smashing in the last commands to gracefully shut down the server before it cooked itself to death. 


**SERVER SHUTTING DOWN. MELTDOWN AVERTED.**  


My coworker later told it took so long because he had to search for the guard. Apparently he had, after searching for almost 20 minutes, found the guard asleep in one of the few offices that had a ceiling fan installed. I was too wrung out to give him a good earful so I just downed the bottle of water my coworker gave me and got dressed again. Once back at the office I was told to take the rest of the day off to recover from my ordeal (and for my coworkers to laugh at the newbie behind her back I guess).

192,Stupid user breaks his laser printer in the dumbest way,"Hello guys!

This is my first post here and I'm excited that I finally have a story to share! I'm a long time lurker.

I work for a third party IT company. We get a lot of service calls regarding printers. Mostly laser printers that we sell and install for clients ourselves, but today we got a call from a completely new client about a laser printer that had a ""paper jam"".

Our boss goes on-site expecting to pull out an accordioned piece of paper from the fuser but he gets something ridiculous instead. The user admits he tried printing on to a **transparency film.** You know those things teachers would use on projectors and display onto whiteboards? Yea. That. The user thought he could put **plastic** through a **laser printer**. So the heat from the fuser just melted the plastic and it, well, *fused* itself around the fuser roller.

*sigh*

So we tell him we don't know if we'll be able to fix it. We take it back to our office and begin taking it apart, but it's one of those cheap HP LaserJets meant for homes, not businesses. We didn't sell this to them.

It took is a good 20 minutes to take it apart. We had to completely dismantle the damn thing to get to the fuser.

Before we even started we knew the fuser was trashed and we couldn't find any of the parts online to replace it. So we told the client there wasn't anything we could do, but we'd be more than happy to direct them toward a nice inkjet for their transparencies and a better quality laser printer.

tl;dr User tried printing a transparency film through a laser printer. That's a no-no.

So that's my first tech support tale!

I took a picture of the fuser once I got it out. I noticed the rules said no image links so I didn't want to post right away. Just let me know if I can without breaking the rules!

193,Damn magnets,"This has happened a few times over the years, but never close enough together for my brain to go there first.

Client opens a ticket this morning saying her (just brought back from a vacation) laptop's external monitor was going black and the desktop was bouncing back and forth between her 2nd screen and her laptop screen.

Asked her to jiggle wires, make sure the monitor had a solid connection, try it without the monitor for a while, etc...

It was still doing it. Updated drivers and bios, still doing it. Out of dumb luck, I had to drop by that site today.

It took less than 5 minutes for it to happen and I recognized the cause immediately.

Me: ""Is that bracelet new?""

Her: ""Yeah, isn't it cute? I just started wearing it.""

Me: ""Does it happen to have a magnetic clasp?""

It did...

It had a magnetic clasp and kept tripping the screen switch when her wrist got close.

I was ready to replace the damn laptop just going back and forth in the ticket because I completely forgot about the last time someone came to me with that issue.

194,The Dragon Lady,"So, I used to work for a small MSP, managing small to medium sized networks in the area.  We had this one client whom we all referred to as ""The Dragon Lady"".  Now, DL was the most miserable person on the face of the planet, especially to her employees.  People lived in fear of this beast, and us lowly support technicians were not beyond her wrath.  Her primary form of communication was berating and belittling.  This is but one tale of my constant battle with the Dragon....

**DL:** What have you people done to my system, we are completely down!!

**Me:** What do you mean you guys are down?  What exactly isn't working?  We haven't touched your systems today.

**DL:**  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!  JUST FIX MY @!#@ SYSTEM NOW!

**Me:** DL, I still don't know what exactly is wrong, can you explain to me what's happening?

**DL:** YOU BROKE MY INTERNET!

**Me:** Your internet is down? 

**DL:** OF COURSE IT IS, YOU @#$@#@! BROKE IT!  GET SOMEONE HERE NOW AND FIX IT!!

**Me:** Ok, this could very well be an ISP issue, we need to contact them first before we dispatch anyone.

**DL:** WE CANNOT BE DOWN THAT LONG!! GET OUT HERE AND FIX IT NOW!!

At this point, she was getting to hostile for my blood, and kept demanding onsite service without even trying to work with me over the phone, so I transferred her my boss (owner of the company) to calm her down while I went outside and sucked down a cigarette.  I get back from my much needed nicotine and my boss informs me that he has soothed the savage beast enough that she is will to work with me some more before we dispatch someone.....

**Me:** Ok, so you're internet is down.  Has anything on your network changed today?  Did anyone plug something in that you know of?

**DL:** Of course not!  The only thing that's anyone has done today is \[ISP Company\] came and replaced some of their equipment.

**Me:**...........wait, do you know what they replaced?

**DL:** The modem.

**Me:** Did they verify internet access after they replaced the modem?

**DL:**  Yes!  They said internet was working from the modem.  But nothing works on our network now!

**Me:** Are they still there?

**DL:** No, they left after replacing it.

*Ugh......*

**Me:** I think I know what's going on, but I need to contact them, can I call you back in a couple of minutes

**DL:**  NO!  I don't believe you will call me back.  If you need to call them, then put me on hold!

**Me:** Ok, I'll place you on hold.....

*Proceed to put her on hold and call her every nasty thing I ever learned on the playground.....*

A quick call to the ISP verified my suspicion that the new modem did not carry over their static IP address.  The phone call took all of 10 minutes.  I explained what happened to her after we verified her internet had been restored, and she basically just grunted, said ""Thanks"" and hung up.

195,Crazy coincidences on first day of the job,"Not a user story, but I thought you guys might find it interesting:

I started a new job on Monday and there's been some issues getting my accounts set up so I can actually start learning. Partly because my new company is in the process of merging with another and getting various systems synced up, which is understandable.

But apparently there was a former employee of one of the companies whose full name (say John Smith) is exactly the same as my first and middle names (say John Smith Jones). And this has somehow caused such a severe issue with creating my account that they've got all the high end admins scratching their heads over it. The active directory account is fine, but all of their secondary systems are freaking out and either showing me the other guy's old info or nothing at all.

196,iPhones are complicated sometimes,"Obligatory LTL, FTP, obligatory “I’m not IT, just family IT”, and obligatory “I’m on mobile, what is format?”

This story happened back in 2013, when I was in high school still. My mother wants to go with her cousin to see a famous spirit medium and wants to record their conversation on her phone. I show my mother how to use the voice memos app, she’s able to record me a couple times, all is good. She goes to see her medium, I go to bed.

Next day at school, my class is given free roam of the campus so we can work on some project. I decide to chill out in the library (maxin’ relaxin’, all cool), when I get a phone call from my mother. Pretty weird, partly because it’s only about 9 in the morning and she knows I’m at school, and partly because she’s one of those kinds of parents that values education above *everything*. Not sure why she’d choose to interrupt my (and the class’s) dreadfully important lecture on globalism, but I happened to be chilling in the library, so alright, I answer it.

&gt;$me: Alright, what’s going on?

&gt;$mother: Well, I’m in the list of voice memos, and I can see the ones that we made last night as well as the one I just made, but when I press the one that I just made it doesn’t play. 

&gt;$me: Are you pressing the play button?

&gt;$mother: No, I don’t know how to do that.

&gt;$mother: Yeah, I did that, but it’s not playing. Do I need to wait for you to come home so you can help me?

&gt;$me: -now, look on the left of that highlighted file. Do you see a blue circle on the left of the file’s name, with a white triangle inside the circle? Looks kind of like a play button?

197,Financial Director Loses Finances,"So here begins my story of a company I was at 2 years ago, and how their ignorance and greed almost cost them everything.

So I was the only on-site IT Support with a housing company for people with low-income or low living conditions. Pretty big office, 3 floors with around 50+ people working here. I'd say about 40 of them were incompetent (I had to teach experienced office workers and admins how to print, save files in network locations and rename files)

You can imagine the kind of place it is.

Anyway, we have remote sites for the actual buildings we have our clients in (block of 100+ flats or so) and employees who work there, but limit it to 4 people per remote site. We use an external company for our network services, exchange, storage, CCTV, etc. Really good company, had a good relationship with the guys there and we always had transparency - anything to do with network passwords, playing with the server rack we have setup in the building, they'd never mind me touching things. Suffice to say I think they trusted me, but I earned that trust.

The company I worked for at the time had a really old Oracle virtualisation setup from a previous out-sourced network company that they paid bare minimal for. I was gobsmacked at the fact that they managed to run 37 VM's running Win10x64-Pro on a 128GB memory, 2GHz CPU, poorly-configured server. If we hit 40 VM's shit would start hitting the roof.

I mean, they didn't even setup the email routing from the VM properly. They linked it through IMAP AND THEN to the exchange server publically. Why? don't ask. Don't know how it's possible, but they did. Why not just link it straight to the exchange server? It's all on the same network layer.

So, after finding this out for the first time I decided to contact our out-sourced company I have a good relationship with, for now I'll call them ""coolguys"". I told them how they were routing the emails on the VM's, and so they told me they'd been in contact with the previous network company about the virtualisation server, and since it was way out of warranty and we weren't their client, coolguys were able to take the  server into their own offices and set it up there (for a small fee, but they didn't mind, you'll see why), this was done on the weekend to prevent work downtime. I receive a call from the CTO of coolguys (yeah, this guy actually does support work too, actually works like a normal employee whilst doing important business sheninigans) How do I know this? I work with him now ;), but I can get into more detail about that in the comments if you have questions.

Nonetheless! He said on the phone that this virtualisation setup was horrendous and it needed a complete revamp. The migration wouldn't be hard whatsoever, in fact, the whole process wouldn't be due to the transparency we had and obviously snapshotting. He saw that 95-100% of the memory was constantly being used, the server simply wasn't built for this workload. VM's started to become HEAVILY sluggish. So, first thing we did was fix that email issue and linked it straight to our exchange server. All good on that side.

So, I was on call with the CTO (we'll call him coolboi), and throughout this whole process he had underlings to do the emails for us whilst he was on the phone with me, breaking down the whole process and how the server needed completely new hardware in order to keep up with the current usage. Since I was the only IT guy in the office, I handled printer cartridges, the finances for all hardware we had, etc. I had direct contact with the MD and FD because of this.

But boy, were the MD and FD ignorant. I broke down the whole situation for them bit by bit (they weren't too clued up about IT lingo but if said right they'll understand):

&gt;\&gt; Me: So, I was on the phone to coolboi and we spoke about the current situation with our Virtual Machines and the server running those VM's.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; FD: \*glares intently\* (FD is female, financial directors don't really talk until money is involved, you know the drill - also bare in mind our turnover was around 15 mill and RISING)  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; MD: Okay, so what is the current situation?  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Me: We currently have 38 VM's running on a very old server which is almost at it's limit since the capacity of VM's on this server is 40. We definitely need to look into upgrading, especially considering we have new sites being built and therefore we'll have more remote users. As you know some people in the office even have VM's since they work at home on weekends or after working hours.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; FD: But we paid money for that server to run those VM's, so why can't we just keep using it as it is?

At this point I ALREADY wanted to launch a chair in her face or something, I don't condone violence but if you were just listening to me you wouldn't have had to ask me that question.

&gt;\&gt; Me: \*repeats the capacity explanation\*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; FD: Okay so then that means we can just pay for a small upgrade to 50 VM's?  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; MD: (makes a good point for once) No but we can't just upgrade for an extra 10, what happens when we get even more employees? We are already over 40+ in this office alone. That's a no-go.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Me: Considering that, I want to also add if you did upgrade to 50 VM's, you'll keep making payments to upgrade it every now and then and you'll end up spending more. (FD should've thought about that before anything)  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Me (again): I wanted to propose that we have a complete upgrade. Currently we're running on an old Oracle virtualisation setup, we'd need to move over to MS Hyper-V with much higher specs.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; MD: Leave it to me, I'll talk to coolboi since this is important.

So after that interestingly and uncomfortably short conversation (I don't like how easily it was absorbed by them, usually a lot of ifs and buts) about 2 weeks pass by and I hear nothing about it. During this time I also found

out that they are storing files locally on their VM's not on the network locations (which I myself and coolguys ALWAYS advise to do just incase for extra redudancy) and now, this is the part where you should know that MD and FD always use virtual machines; everyday after 6PM, they transfer files from the local office PC's to the VM, go home and continue working. I brushed this off as they don't usually do this, must've had their reasons. Another week passes by and I still haven't heard nothing about this virtualisation upgrade, so I get more focused on it because it's so important otherwise we're going to drop our workload tenfold and potentially lose files.

So I recieve a call from a remote site with a woman who is using her VM, let's call her mrstootsie (on the spot names, no relevance at all)

&gt;\&gt; mrstootsie: Hi! &lt;me&gt; I'm having slight issues with my VM, I can't get onto the shared drives, but before getting hit down I noticed that LOADS of accounting folders started appearing inside Z: server\\Portfolio  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Me: Okay that's really odd, I'm going to connect to your VM so you'll be kicked out for a minute just so I can look.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; mrstootsie: Sure thing!

Mfw I login to her VM and find everything is corrupted, I literally, mean, everything. Even opening a word shortcut would return a registry error. I instantly call up coolboi's mobile cos this shit's important.

&gt;\&gt; Me: Hey man, look something weird is--  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; coolboi: I know what you're about to tell me, you see all data on the VM's corrupting. The only effected shared drive is server\\Portfolio

I realised, at this very moment, my FD and MD are about to recieve the biggest shit scare of their life. Data ranging from invoices to bills, to business transactions, investments, shares.

coolboi actually warned us of this weeks prior in a Skype conversation with my manager:

&gt;""the delays between the two remote places will never work with opening large or any file, alot of data corruption will start appearing especially since we are way over capacity and need to get this upgraded ASAP.""

So to run down before shit hits the fan, server\\Portfolio is the most used by everyone in the company and is always active with file changes, renames, new files, etc which is why it's the only one effected.

&gt;Me: Yeah, nice! One thing though, can you check server\\Portfolio for any accounting folders?  
&gt;  
&gt;coolboi: Don't fuck with me right now &lt;me&gt;, I am seeing the whole of server\\Accounting files and folders inside portfolio, that's around 10TB transfer.

coolboi begins to check the actual accounting drive itself and finds NOTHING since it was MOVED not COPIED. I wonder who did this?

So he did some digging and found out it was FD. Surprise! I forgot to mention at this point, in those weeks, we had about 15 new employees each with VM's, which puts us to way over 40 VM's and maximum server capacity.

FD decided to move everything from accounts to portfolio, which bang, somehow, don't know how, kicked off the whole corruption. I think the server was handling too much r/W'ing but this wouldn't have happened if she did this in the office with a direct connection to the main network. She did this, on her VM. I still don't know to this day why she did it.

I went upstairs to tell MD and FD the situation, and panic broke loose. They started ordering admins to get every bit of financial paper before I could even mutter the words ""Don't worry though, we have a backup from 2 days ago"".

At this point there was so much going on I couldn't even get to talk to them, they weren't listening. Baring in mind, they were warned weeks prior of this happening.

coolboi comes in to our office in a meeting with myself, MD, FD and my manager. He has everything, complete list of every single component for a server that can manage 70+ virtual machines with much higher storage capacity on flash storage, I really pushed on moving away from HDD's for VM's. He gave pricing, dates, future expectations, and on top, the support for the server will remain 100% free. Nonetheless it all came to £8,000 for a whole new virtualisation setup. DEDICATED. Thought that was a steal.

MD and FD, in summary, denied the whole thing. Stupidly enough after that whole experience, didn't feel the price was justified. But then 3 days later spend £20,000 on buying gifts for the guys on the 3rd floor, go on holiday every two weeks and buy themselves the most expensive clothes and brands you'd not even think they'd be buying.

***TL;DR - FD caused all VM's to corrupt and a whole shared drive to completely corrupt which had all finances and important business data that should not be getting lost and shouldn't have been there in the first place. Still won't upgrade the virtual server.***

After that I left the company about a month later. Don't know what's going on there.

199,Ocean heat,"LTL; FTP

I spent about 15 years of my adult life working for a survey company. A lot of that time was spent riding various boats/ships providing IT support and data processing for geophysical, bathymetric, and seismic surveying offshore. I was reminded of this story by the ""All Hot and Bothered in the Server Room"" story... 

I arrived to the ship to prepare for a bathymetric ( multibeam ) survey. We had a few technical problems before we were able to leave the dock. The first among those was that the ships controls were down ( throttle, steering, navigation, etc ), but that's a tale for another time. The 2nd problem was some sort of electrical fault that resulted in a very loud hum coming from the electrical room near the wheelhouse AND a complete lack of air conditioning on the upper deck. 

The rest of the survey team was in a data collection shack on the back deck where geophysical surveys happened and I was in the multibeam lab... on the upper deck... For reasons unknown, the lights were also out, but all of the power outlets in the room had power. We reported the issue to headquarters and were told in no uncertain terms to ""go out and make it work"", so off to work we go. I spent several hours sitting in the multibeam lab running the bathymetric survey and running out to an air conditioned conex during line turns to cool off. The multibeam lab got up to about 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Our data collection computers were old Sun UltraSparc II's and they held up admirably... until they baked at 115 degrees for a couple of hours. After about 6 or 7 hours of work, the data collection machine and the file server both shutdown due to overheating. Somehow, the main office still wanted us to continue working. We eventually managed to convince them that trying to proceed would destroy $$$'s worth of computers and that the upper deck was no longer habitable for any amount of time. 

Surprisingly, none of the hardware was damaged in this adventure and we were able to go back to work about 24 hours later with a functional air conditioner. ",False,92,3,sambeaux45,talesfromtechsupport
200,Trust not in your tech lest ye be disabused of your notions.,"LTL. Rare poster due to being sidetracked halfway through writing up most of my tales.  

We recently got a glowforge laser cutter. This is not our first laser cutter but our old epilog was pretty much dead at this point.  

Our previous workflow was corel draw and then print to the epilog using a special print driver. The glowforge on the other hand uses a web interface that accepts several file types but not corel's .cdr filetype. So my current workflow has been corel to .SVG . Well yesterday I found out that trusting the output file was a bad idea. In the web interface most things are drawn kinda small because all you are doing is positioning them. (you can zoom in but this is not the editing stage so you rarely do.)  

I kept getting odd glitches on my engraves. After spending an hour messing with settings and then cleaning the laser lenses I finally decided to open up the svg file and look at it.  

It seems corel has a draw like a drunken 5 year old option buried somewhere in the export settings.

201,I didn't put that bullet hole there; you did!,"So this happened a few years back. It was technically before I was full on tech support. I was more of a hardware engineer at the time. 

I was working for a company that did third party repair of POS for food chains and a few other random retail locations across the country. This particular retail was based on the west coast, and our facility was in the midwest.

$Shady- Me

$Broken- Client

$Idiot- My manager

$Wraith- My lead/subtle genius

The phone in our workshop rings one day, and it's $idiot. She calls to tell us that she just got of the phone with a client and that they had a POS that had a broken screen and needed repaired ASAP. She assured them that if they overnighted it, we could have it done the next day, and back on a truck within 24 hours. Keep in mind, we have no idea what they are sending us, how bad it is, or anything else. She was infamous for doing this to us, as she had no tech background what so ever. 

Fast forward to the next day, and there is a giant box waiting for us in our workshop. $Wraith and I break it open, ready to get to work on this thing, and we just stand there in utter disbelief.  What we saw, was a POS that was broken in 3 pieces, with a screen that not only had a boot print on it, but what looked a lot like a bullet hole, too. 

We immediately call, $Idiot to the back to look at this thing. She comes back and take s a look and asks us what the problem is. We gently explain to her that it isn't something we can fix, as all the mounts are broken, the screen has a thru and thru hole, and the base looks like it took a good old fashion beating, too. She goes off the rails, as she often did, and started ranting about how we had a contract with the client and if we broke the SLA, that we'd have to pay out a bunch of money, etc, etc. She then told us that we would have to talk to the client when they called back in and explain to them that we couldn't do it.

She locked herself in her office for the rest of the day, and wouldn't talk to us, or the client when they called, so it came to us. We put him on speaker, and talked to him about how it was beyond broken, with boot prints, bullet holes and who knows what else. we also mentioned that it was packed poorly, with no package protection. It was literally just tossed in a box and sent to us. He went on about how we did all that damage, and he wasn't going to eat the cost of it, etc, etc. 

Eventually, we got the Company owner involved, and there were some legal things that happened. Long story short, we didn't pay for it, and $idiot was moved to manager over shipping, while my buddy $wraith became the manager over repair.

202,The tragedy of Y2k,"In the year or so leading up to the millennium, it was all over the news about Y2k. Lots of people were afraid we were going to be thrown back into the dark ages, because most computer programs at that time only coded the date as 2 characters instead of 4, and some other math that I'm sure much more intelligent folks than me can explain. Suffice to say, people were doomsday prepping left and right.  New Year rolls around, and, thanks to the heroics of some amazing folks (I know a few of the coders who worked to keep the dark ages away) nary a peep was heard except...

The date was January 2nd, 2000. I was fresh out of high school and working in the Service Center of a bovine inspired computer company. In walks a man with his tower, sets it down on the counter, and says his CD isn't working.  No problem, we are here to help. 

I grab the serial number off the back, and turn the tower around so the front faces me, when I see it. The front of the plastic case is shattered. Turning the case to look at the ""left"" side (the side that opened) I saw a hole, right about the right size for a bullet holes. I looked up at the customer, back at the computer, then sweetly asked home to wait a min. I ran in back and grabbed the techs, swearing it would be worth it, but not saying anything else. 

We arrive back up front, my three techs look on in wonder, and we all look at the customer who has gone very quiet. He explained he thought the end of the world was near so he stocked up on food water and about 30 Russian SKSs with sundry amo.  His son, who had some mental health issues, had gotten one of his possibly illegally modified SKSs and sprayed the whole living room down.  No casualties, except the walls and the tower.

Took it back, cracked the case. The bullet had missed everything except it nicked the IDE cable. We replaced it on the spot, buttoned it back up, and that ladies and gents, was our only Y2k issue.

207,The day the internet died,"It was a lazy Thursday, about 1 pm in the afternoon, and I had just come back from a delicious taco lunch. One of my duties is to chase down TSM backup failures from the night before, figure out why they didn't run, and run a one-time, just in case. I had a list of 5 and had worked my way through 2 already. Fired up the 3rd.

I'm happily reading um... training materials, let's go with that,  as a one time runs, when the senior VP of IT ($SVP) comes to my desk. Now, at my company, it's a pretty nice place, and I have had a few pleasent conversations with $SVP, so I took off my headphones and gave him a smile. He did not return the smile...uh oh.

$SVP: Are you running any TSM stuff right now?

$me: Well, yes, there's lots going on right now...what's up?

I trailed off and looked at him expectantly. 

$SVP: Are you running anything in DMZ?

Now, we have a DMZ zone that keeps our outside customers from accessing internal resources. TSM is one of the few applications that can get to both areas.

$me: Well, let me check.

I looked up the server I was running a one time on and low and behold it was a DMZ server, and so was the previous one as well, but I still had no idea why that would matter. I confirmed for $SVP that yes I was running a backup on a DMZ server.

$SVP: Stop that immediately. Why would you run those during the day??!?! Nothing should be run during the day!!

$me: Well, I can stop what I'm doing but this is standard procedure for us, and up until today, have never had an issue. What's going on?

$SVP: Come with me!

Well, I'm fairly certain I'm not going to get fired, but I still had no idea what the heck was going on. He takes me to the network wizard area, and the wizards are all in an uproar. Outside internet access has been unavailable for the last 45 min, and they had just narrowed it down to TSM traffic taking all the bandwidth. The SVP was adamant that we never do another one time backup during the day. I asked that we not be so hasty and let's figure out what happened first. 

The head network wizard finally looks up from his frantic casting, I mean typing, and explains: In order for traffic to get to the DMZ, it had to leave our Network at 10gb, go through the 1gb PAN, through the 450mb Blue Coat to the DMZ, then back. All traffic, including outside access to the internet was routed this way. In kicking off a 20gn and 6gb backup respectively, I had wiped out the pipe, company wide, for the last 45 min. We are a bank so outside access may be important for things like wire transfers, loan applications, YouTube surfing, you know, important stuff.

The $SVP again tried to say no more backups during the day. I said fine, but what happens when I have to restore that 6tb production database that's vital to the feds? I actually heard his brain do a record skip. I explained that the backups were just the symptom, and to avoid this in the future, I won't do any one-time DMZ backups during the day, but if I have to restore production, I'm taking the pipe down again and I don't care for how long. He is a good $SVP and listened. He turned to the Networking Director and asked why this was an issue. Turns out the director didn't want to put new equipment on this year's budget for whatever reason (it's not like we have budget issues, still don't have an explanation on that one), and things were slated to be replaced next year. 

Net, net, no moving of files, or backups during the day, or messing with DMZ at all during business hours unless it's a restore. $SVP apologized for not waiting for the whole story, and for jumping in to say it was my fault before all the facts were in. I can now put on my resume that I encreased employee productivity by 75% by removing outside distractions, company wide. ",False,112,38,peach2play,talesfromtechsupport

After the hassle and subsequent crowding of the $boss's office with old prototypes everything was back to normal. The old server did indeed serve. The co-workers were pleased with a set of second monitors (seriously, who is still programming with only one [not ultra wide]?). The interns did their best to get rid of the corporate junk and I could start working again and finished a cost sheet for the new server and installations.


Monday morning before my first tea my company provided phone rings. Nobody would ever call that since I am quite new. On the display some weird foreign number. Preparing to waste time of a scammer I picked it up:


&gt; Hello, this is Luesterklemme from $company, how can I help you on this fine Monday morning?


&gt; Hello, this is $supportingPerson (SP) from you soon to be parent parent company. We will be doing your IT support from now on.


&gt; Oh, nice. I didn't know we were bought. Sounds good, so I can be an engineer again. What do you need of me and when will you start here?


&gt; I will need all the passwords for the network equipment and servers. You don't need to do anything. And what do you mean start? I started already.


&gt; I mean like on premise. In this office. In person.


&gt; Yeah I won't be doing that. We will support you remotely.


&gt; Ok, I think we might run into problems here. This office needs new stuff installed and I can think of a dozent things that can and will go wrong that needs somebody to interact with the problem physically. In the case you don't have the power of telekinesis I am pretty much in doubt.


&gt; Leave that to us. We are professionaly and you are not the first office we are supporting. 


&gt; *metaphorical jazz hands*


After that weird call I got and email matching the name from the phone with a corporate provided email adress. Huh? No scam? Somebody must be playing a joke? Not the first of April either. Shouting to boss he denies any involvment and confirms the buy out story. My week was going to get intersting again but not in a good way. 


So you might suspect where this is going. In this first week the Eldritch Gods tried to purge all sanity from the office. Not only did I lose all the admin accesses (at least officially, of course I made spare accounts beforehand and nobody bothered to check...), the server project got pushed back and as the icing on the Cthulu shaped cake that little Linux server was abruptly shut down because ""it was reachable from the outside"". That's the whole point of a server but I digress. 


As first meaure I got a remote root server I was not intending giving the support guys any access (or even knowledge of the existence) and tried to keep on networking as if nothing changed. Because I am a nice person I tried to make it work full knowing it will end up in an epic supernova of networking FUBAR. Any mentioning that for some work somebody has to be present was ignored and the whole support was plastered with guidelines, tickets and restrictions. The change of some alias email adresses on the SMTP took them the better part of a week and it didn't even work. 


The engineers started to get unhappy and always diligently pointed to the support sitting in another country and after a couple days of ticket ping pong did it myself as support support. I also logged all the wasted hours I spent, faults and wrongs they did and instances where they could do nothing (restarting a network switch. Still no telekinesis?) and readied myself for the final blow.


On the following week Tuesday morning I informed my co-workers there might be network connectivity problems and instructed them to rely on the networks stuff as little as possible. I logged in a provided some critical points with static IPs (except for $boss's laptop of course). From the depth of the abyss then rose a little network switch. Drawing my runes and symbols I connected it to the network. I stirred the sleep of the thing that should not be. I took another network cable, plugged it in and in my satanic ritual plugged it in again. 


What followed was a evil storm of stray DHCP packets. The hail of new and not so new device information kicked and reconnected all DHCP devices in a endless downward spiral until the end of time. I imagined the control dashboard of the supporters I supported like a infernal christmas tree where all lights started blinking red and green and maybe yellow too. My colleagues were warned and I sat back and played the waiting game. 


About 20 minutes later I get a frantic call from the other office.


&gt; Hey, what is happening with you office? I can only sporadically reach you?


Feigning ignorance:
&gt; Oh, I don't know? I've seen it work with some devices. The printers are fine. Internet works for some too? 


&gt; Can you have a look that the firewall is correcly configured or apply a backup?


&gt; Sorry ~~Dave~~ I cannot do that. I have no access. 


&gt; Oh. And is ther server still ok?


&gt; It is still running. Everything else is your job. I can't log in, I have no access. 


&gt; Sh...I will think of something. Talk to you later...  *click*


Smirking I went back to work. $boss came around and asked what was happening and all the pieces of my plan fell together.


&gt; Yeah we have network outages. Can't tell whats happening but I guess today is gonna be no good day to get work done on the shares. Sorry.


&gt; Can't you do something?


&gt; Nope. Not my responsibility. 


After lunch (4 hours of outage so far) I get another call.


&gt; Hey Luesterklemme, I've got a solution: You get you cell phone and tether the cell service to a laptop, you connect the RS232 to the firewall and I remote in to solve the problem!


&gt; Okay.


I really wanted to see that since the storage cabinet had barely any reception but I gave it my best shot. After setting everything up $SP went to work and after a few hours of agonizingly slow debugging went home after calling and telling he found nothing (no, really?) and we should all tether our phones. I waited another 30 minutes and put Cthulu back in its slumber. 


The deed was done. The storm was over. Sluggish DHCP packeges oozed back to their place. And none of the remote support where any wiser what caused the outage. I readied my weapons for the full frontal assault and got the accesses back and the renewals of the plans for the new server in about 2 weeks of discussions and my biggest backer was $boss after I calculated (in management calculations) what that outage had cost us and will in the future when the server follows Cthulu and loses its mind.


And of course that was not the final part since that little server that could still served and now also the parent parent company wanted to play ball. But that is another story for another time.

Our system setup was a small linux netbook running our transcript server, connected to a Cisco router already configured for our purposes; we would chain out some network switches from the LAN ports, setting up laptops for local users, and use the local venue's internet access through the WAN port to provide the service to external authorised parties.

As usual I'd set up our core system for the transcription team and started on the networking. I looked around for a floor port but turned up nothing and gestured to the hotel manager, who will be $HM (and I'll list the other actors as they come in a similar manner).

&gt; **$ME**: (unused to such politeness) I, uh, need to get internet access to provide our service.

She goes over to a wall panel and unscrews it to reveal: their own router, plugged into the wall. I ask if it's alright to disconnect and I'm told it's fine, it's just for the wifi and there's plenty of coverage.

So I plug the cable into my router's WAN and wait for it to come up. I can't do much with the server until the internet is instated, so I'm waiting just for this.

It never does anything. I wait, I unplug, I turn it off and on again, nothing. I plug the cable back into the hotel router and connect to its wifi. Internet access is back in seconds. Oh dear. This must be a local router setting.

So I try something else. I take a cable from the hotel's router's LAN port and stick it in our WAN. Nada. Zip. I try it with a laptop.

I get an IP address and have network access, but no internet. And the hotel's internal network has security, probably MAC address limitations. I gesture to $HM again.

&gt; **$ME**: I need direct access to the internet but I think only your routers are allowed to use the local ethernet connections. Can I get a different line or have it reconfigured?

&gt; **$HM**: I am not sure I understand. Let me call an interpreter.

The English interpreter arrives post haste and I reiterate my query to her.

&gt; **$EI**: I am not sure I understand. Let me call an interpreter *with knowledge of technical terms*.

The technical interpreter arrives and I say, once more, my query. He nods at me and calls a number on the room phone. Four men in jumpsuits arrive and he presumably relays my question in Japanese.

After a moment, the men all nod excitedly and smile at me.

I smile back and take a seat.

The men continue to smile and stand there.

After a few minutes of silence, I realise my question has been lost in translation.

There are a few hours before the clients are due to start arriving.

After being told the local tech support does not speak or read English, I attempt to use a flipchart and markers to relay the message using pictograms. This is also unsuccessful.

Running out of both options and time, I wonder if I can reconfigure the router for our service by connecting to it with a laptop by cable and directly accessing the gateway IP.

I am confronted by completely incomprehensible Japanese characters with no way of translating them. I do know what a router login screen looks like however, so I ask the TI for the router admin details.

None of the hotel staff know, so I take a wild stab in the dark and try the default login details on the bottom of the thing (root / root) and ***what do you know***?!

Stumbling through menu options, I do eventually get the router configured as intended, sort out the rest of the room for networking and the job goes off without a hitch.

214,Guy says he lost his file; Forensics majors call him on his BS.,"I've never posted here so IDK if this counts. I'll try to keep it short.

About 4 years ago in College, I was in a fraternity whose chapter I helped start. I won't give the name here, but this wasn't a party fraternity or anything, it was pretty heavily focused on community service and actually forbade drinking at all official meetings and functions. That's not really important to the story, but it gives you an idea about the kind of group we were. Anyways, part of our pledge process involved a presentation that the pledge needed to make and present to the brothers, usually about the history of our organisation. We didn't expect a whole lot, we just expected them to A) get facts right, and B) actually do it.

Well, during my Junior year one kid (we'll call him $PK for Pledge Kid) was being a pain about pretty much anything we asked him to do. To be clear nothing was ""Crazy Pledge Stuff"", we're talking 'do a few hours of community service' and 'have conversations with all the available brothers', and he'd always have some kind of excuse. Eventually, $PK was assigned his presentation, and come the night of, he says he doesn't have it. The discussion went like this:

*$PK:* ""I made my presentation today,, but Power Point  closed before I could save it, and now its gone!""  
*Fraternity President ($FP):* ""Do you think you could present if you had the slides?""  
*$PK:* ""Definitely, I remember most of the talking points.""  
*$FP:* ""Sounds good. $Brother1, $Brother2, and $Me, can you go help him out?""  

You see, what $PK didn't realize was that $B1, $B2, and $Me were all studying Computer Forensics, and had all learned to retrieve a crap ton of information, and a lost Power Point presentation would be easy pickin's compared to some of our assignments. $FP explained this and, looking nervous, agreed that if we could retrieve the presentation that he'd present it. So the lot of us follow $PK to his dorm room, and he lets us take a look at his PC. Well we all ensured that we knew the right steps to recover the document. We go through all the steps, each of us making sure the steps are right (we were students, after all), and we do find an autosaved copy of the presentation.

&gt;*$Me:* ""So is this the presentation? It's the newest file here.""  
&gt;*$PK, looking nervous:* ""Umm, yeah, it probably was that.""  
&gt;*$B1:* ""Great, glad we could find it. Let's open it just to make sure it's right.""  

$B2 opens the restored document

&gt;*$B2:* ""There's only a title page here.""  
&gt;*$PK:* ""It must not be from the right time!""  

$B2 opens the document properties window.

&gt;*$B2:* ""This says it was last modified and last accessed at about 5:30 pm, about half an hour before the meeting started.""  
&gt;*$PK:* ""Well that's not right!""  
&gt;*$Me:* ""That also says the document was only created at about 5pm anyway.""  
&gt;*$B1:* ""If you needed extra time on your presentation we could've given you an extra week. We understand schoolwork comes first.""  

Back at the meeting place, $PK explains to us and to $FP that he was going to make the presentation after all his classes, and that once he got free, he started to create the presentation and closed it once he realized he wouldn't finish in time. We explained that we understood how time can get away from someone, and how we didn't take any of this so extremely seriously that we were gonna kick him out just for a late presentation, but that lying about it was a problem, and how we need brothers to be responsible for their actions and their inaction. How, since our fraternity focuses so heavily on Community Service, we need to make sure that we aren't making flimsy excuses to not participate in service outings. He understood, and I believe a week or two later he did present. But it was agreed by all, including $PK, that this fraternity might not have been a good fit for $PK.

215,Homebrew TeamViewer,"This is my first post, so I'm sorry if the structure is weird.

I'm the tech support for my family. My dad is fairly good with technology. My mom is often overwhelmed by technology's quirks. (She learned punch-card computing in university, but modern systems are mysteries to her.) I know how to solve computer quirks and can even code a little, so I get to help.

Our family recently upgraded our phone plans to a new set of phones with ""cool new features for your convenience"". I made sure that mom and I got the same type of phone so I could help her. I don't have time to set up my phone right away, as I'm travelling to another city, so I decide to set it up when I get there.

Unfortunately, I had forgotten to pack the new phone, and the old phone's contract expired. I bought a cheap month-to-month plan because I would be home in a couple weeks. This plan only allows local calls, and my parents are not in the local calling area. Mom does not like to text.

I suggest that we use $CielVideoCall instead. Mom agrees, and we both log on. It's a program we don't use often. We didn't realize $CielVideoCall had been integrated into $ThatComputerCompany's database, meaning that all the old user information had been wiped. That included contacts.

I end up finding her fairly quickly. The usernames were now the name assigned to the computer, meaning that if you use a weird computer username, it matches. I send her a contact request and a message on the app, and switch my profile photo to a photo of our dog. I text her asking if she got the request. She says she hasn't. I try messaging her on the app another time. No reply.

At this point I try to find my dad's $CielVideoCall profile. I find it, send him a contact request, and he adds me. Great! They can both talk to me from his laptop computer. I call.

Problem solved, right?

If it was, it wouldn't be on this subreddit. Mom brings Dad's computer to the office and balances it against something so I can help her figure out why it's not working. The video capture is not kind to her screen - it's too overexposed to read the text well, but I can kind of see the colors.

$Mom: It keeps telling me to buy something.

$Me: That's not the program, that's the website. You do not need a premium subscription. Close that and go back to the program. Now click the big blue button on the left to bring up -

$Mom: It's brought up the payment window again. I don't want to give them my money.

Me: You're clicking the wrong place.

I try to direct her through the steps, using screen-share mode as a guide. Dad helps with the instructions too.  She still can't find me.

It's quite late at this point, and we have many other things to discuss, so I just tell her to call $CielVideoCall tech support the next morning.

216,The quick way to destroy a hard drive,"I brought a couple of old (ancient) PC's home from a customer's house the other day, along with an imperial butt load of cables and other assorted junk. They had requested that I remove the hard drives and destroy them. Wife wants me to carry them downstairs because her mother is coming home. Everything is in a large, heavy, cardboard box, so I just grab it and head for the basement. Can't quite see where the first step is, so I'm inching forward when, suddenly there's no step. I lurch forward down a step and the heavy box proceeds to tumble down the stairs.

217,Don't put your f****** production database where it doesn't belong!,"Last week we were at a remote site (hotel/camping) of one of our clients that is a bit independently managed. Our main goal: Prepare their somewhat ancient Windows Small Business 2008 Server dreadnought of an IBM tower for decomissioning.

That trip was planned weeks ago. Everything was layed out:

\-rebuild their network structure to make use of a recently laid fibre and unifi (ha!) everything but separate the office network from the guest network; that site somehow forgot to mention to us for nearly a year that they contracted a local ISP/MSP to set up a guest wifi network with a pretty healthy Unifi stack + 100/40 speed, while their office happily cludged along with 2 Mbit down / 0,00 up on a piece of shit ISP provided plastic CPE router where you configure the internal LAN IP under the DHCP tab...

\-set up a site to site VPN between the main and remote site

\-dump their PSTs, upload those to the main Exchange server &amp; set up Outlook correctly for the first time; for some shit reason the client's Outlooks downloaded emails via a POP3 account &amp; put them in the .ost file of a local Exchange account (I didn't know until a month ago that this was even possible; and why would you)

\-migrate their user profiles to the new domain (shoutout to ForensIT!)

\-migrate their on-prem hotel management software to the cloud offering of the same vendor (the main reason for that particular SBS' existence)

\-migrate all shares to a local Synology &amp; set up double backups local &amp; remote

\-point the AV to the new management server

\-throw SSDs at their not-old-enough-yet desktops mainly because WE can't stand to work on anything else anymore

\-yadda yadda other small office stuff like fighting with the correct syntax for scan-to-smb on their kyocera yadda yadda

Everything went mostly fine. We were done in only 12 hours for a total of 3 PCs in sweltering central European heat. All new or altered workflows were checked by the staff and got the final ""it's all so fast now!"" sign of approval. We nodded at ourselves for a job well done.

""So, we're gonna take this monster away now?""

Uncertain finger tapping.

""...better not. Just shut it down and see what happens. I swear to you that some bullshit is just waiting to jump at us. Leave it connected so that the staff can just switch it on."" The machine was wound down and the office temperature dropped by 5°C in the next 10 minutes, I swear.

Bullshit jumped at me today.

The assistant hotel manager wrote a somewhat panicked email, that their personel management Access database wouldn't open. (for you younglings: Access is nowadays regarded as a somewhat fancied-up Excel)

Wait, what? We checked that it worked after the migration. There was this single Access file on the share that we migrated to the Synology NAS and which we *saw* they used.

Weeell, we checked that it worked *before* we shut down the server... Obviously we overlooked a dependency.

But how, why!? Why would that Access file not work anymore if the server would be offline?

In this case, the only reason why that Access would have problems is if the actual data is not kept by the Access file itself but by a database that the Access file would connect to.

Usually you'd do this by connecting that Access (file) to a SQL server instance &amp; and subsequent database, which would be a good enough solution for something small like this. That database could be on the same machine or somehwere else on the network, say, on a server.

But we looked: There was no SQL instance on the server other than the usual SBSMonitoring instance that comes/came with every Small Business Server installation and that no one ever, in the past, present and future ever cared, cares or would care for. It's just... there. You don't touch it. You let it do it's thing because you fear the repercussions of too much meddling. It's like a Baltimore cop that is completely aware of the drug trade right in front of him, but can't act on it *all the time* because that would generate more problems, what with the complex socioeconomic intricacies of the drug trade in communities and cities.

But, see, that is the administrator/integrator talking. You never now what a *developer* might do...

**Phase 1: Solution oriented approach**

I told them to switch the server back on and after half an hour of presumably huffing and puffing (fingers crossed; it's a bare metal SBS that ran like 8 years straight after all and probably just threw a disk) the server posted and I could remote in. Meanwhile, the hotel manager could access the personel management thingy again and was relieved a bit.

**Phase 2: Problem oriented approach**

Now what was it... ah yes, there was a screenshot of an error message that the manager sent prior to all that when he tried to open the file in the first place.

""ODBC connection error: Can't connect to SBSSERVER\\SBSMonitoring""

Oh you dick... you didn't. Wherever you are, I hope you'll get devoured by a swarm of acid cicadas.

**Phase 3: Post-mortem**

So this is where it's at now: We have to track down the guy that wrote that Access file and was handed access to the server to insert his database into the SBSMonitoring instance (because why spin up a dedicated instance when you can just use what's already there, right?), so that he can do the needful to port this away from the server so that the machine can finally groan to a peaceful death.

In all propability that would be the stereotypical good-with-computers standalone-developer acquaintance of a friend's friend of the former hotel manager and is either dead, retired, disgruntled or at least two of those three. Bonus: He probably only speaks French. I don't.

He sees my console and asks why there are so many connections (16 XLR in, 6 Jack in, 8 xlr out ... small mixer), because bis controller does have only a few (usualy this dj-all-in-one-controlers have two stereo sum outs and a microphone input).

My mom had this friend (they're not friends anymore, long story, police reports had to be filed) who was given an old PC by her daughter that she wanted to get set up so she could check email at home.

Now, this woman, in addition to being a crazy person who would later on go on to threaten to blow-up her workplace, which for the record was a school for children with autism, was almost COMPLETELY computer illiterate. I had to spend like an hour explaining she needed an ISP so that she could access her email at home, that this wasn't free, blah blah blah. We eventually got her set up on dial up, because she refused to pay for anything more.

Anyway, when we finally get to setting up the PC, she goes in her closet, and pulls out a monitor and puts it on the floor, along with the keyboard and mouse. I ask her as gently as I can, where's the computer?

Cue a long discussion on how the monitor she had was just a screen, and there's actually a box that it needed up plug into. She was sure she had given me everything, though.

Eventually she goes back into her closet for several minutes, and finally pulls out a tower. Apparently she just didn't know what it was.

I get it setup quickly, we go to Walmart so that we can get a disk for NetZero, and now she's more pissed she has a monthly fee for using it than grateful I got her emails up and running.

Then a couple of months later she threatened to kill my mom and blow up a bunch of autistic kids.

So I don't help out anyone with tech things anymore unless I'm getting paid.

Edit: You all had questions about the full story with this woman, so I asked my mom exactly what happened.

Basically, she was working at a school for children with autism and got fired. She blamed my mom for getting fired, (as my mom had reported some things she shouldn't have been doing, though lots of other people were reporting her as well.) 

So she got on Facebook and threatened to come after my mom with a gun, and to blow up the school. My mom reported it to the police but they didn't do much.

The woman now blames the whole thing on her psychiatric medications being messed up. My mom ran into her randomly in a store a year ago and the woman apologized. Apparently she's now working for the public school department, so my mom went to them and told them about the threats, though she has no clue if they did anything about it.

So basically I never should have set up a computer for her because that's what she used to make the threats, but there was no way I could have known what would happen. ",False,1526,148,gwynforred,talesfromtechsupport

But then I realized that I was going about this the wrong way.  Gateways have a backdoor into their system that a sysadmin to do all kinds of things.  

Except that even the back door was busted.  Oi.

But wait!  There was an RPC.  Which, upon closer examination was an oooooooold RSM.  Not good.  But it also had a power cycling feature (which is probably why it had been repurposed instead of altogether replaced).  I could work with this!  Assuming it still worked....

I get an e-mail forwarded to me that has a chain of e-mails between the user and our operators explaining why they keep killing his SQL. According to the DB2 plan cache the SQL would exceed 20+ hours. Oops. Enter me.

I e-mail the user from this thread and kindly request the SQL statement. After some back and forth during which he explains to me he has a PhD in Materials Science and has taken so much more advanced math and computer programming that he doubts I'll be able to even understand what is trying to do.

As they say Challenge Accepted.

He sends me his query. He is comparing the data in two files to find where the data in the first file is not in a column in the second file. To be more specific he wants to know for a given part if it is never a child in the bill of material (BOM) file. His part file is 100 thousand parts and his part of the BOM file is 1 million parts. Since he is using a not in and the child field is not indexed the database has to look at all 1 million records each time it finds a part that is not a child. Since most parts are parent parts this means a lot of million row full table scans. I think the final result had about 10 thousand parts that were not children.

So a little SQL magic using Common Table Expressions plus reversing the logic so I can use IN instead of NOT IN and I get the query down to 20 seconds. I love DB2 SQL. (for the record I use Oracle and SQL Server as well and if forced to admit MS Access.)

So I send him this new query for him to test. 

Now we have a new back and forth. The query can't be right because it is... TOO FAST!

The tech support there had informed him that his operating system was too old and that he needed to update, so he let them. After his visit, all sorts of strange things started happening. First, he noticed that when he turned on his computer almost every program he had installed would start automatically. This, of course, was very inconvenient, as it meant he had to spend time closing everything before he could get to work reading his email, which of course, he could now only read 8 at a time of. This proved to be too much, so he came to us.

For those of you that have been using Fruit, Inc. computers for a while, you're aware that at some point they made the absolutely braindead decision to make it so that scrollbars would automatically disappear on computers that have touchpads by default. The thought, of course, is that if you have a touchpad you could just two finger scroll and that's so intuitive, *anyone* could figure that out. This poor instructor's issue was that because the scrollbars disappear and because nobody told him that two finger scrolling was a thing (I believe new computers show you a gestures tutorial on first run, but it's been a while since I've seen a new Fruit laptop fresh out of the box), he thought that he could no longer scroll down further. This was the ""cursor in the middle"" that was ""missing"".

The second issue is that on this particular operating system, closing all the windows of an application does not necessarily mean that the application itself has quit, it just means it has no active windows. Combined with an update that lets you start back where you left off after a shutdown, this meant that every program that he'd ever opened and had closed the window on but never actually quit was still technically running, and when he restarted his computer, the OS helpfully started back up where he ""left off"". Because he was dutifully re-closing the windows (instead of quitting, because again, he doesn't know it's a thing), the computer would helpfully do it *every*. *single*. **time**. he rebooted.

229,Orientation Is Important,"Hello TFTS! LTL;FTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP, etc. etc. etc. This should be short.

I've commented on several stories lately, and finally have one to share myself. Some background: I am now a SME (Sometimes Management-ish Entity) at an inbound technical helpdesk for a particular worldwide corporation. Said corporation has retail locations all over  wherein one exchanges money for wheeled conveyances of various sorts. In addition to said transport, you also receive a printed (triplicate) contract for your records.

It is one of those contracts (or the printer thereof) that brings me to you today.

A co-worker took this call, so I don't have direct dialogue, but for one quote.

The scene is thus: user calls into the desk, with the problem that their printer is malfunctioning. Every contract they print is printing backwards. Not right to left, or bottom to top, but rather the text of the contract is printed on the BACK of the triplicate forms that get fed into the printer. Clearly a printer issue.

The user is somewhat resistant to the suggested troubleshooting: turning the forms face-down in the paper tray, and test-printing a contract to see if this resolves their issue. One bit of this resistance is that 'the issue started recently'. In fact, there was a coincidence of the problem starting with also having reloaded the printer tray with forms.

""Nay!"", I hear you think, dear reader. But ""Yea"" say I. After duly wearing down the caller's resistance, the paper was turned over, a test was printed, and behold, a contract printed on the front of the form, in the correct orientation. It is then our dear caller made this observation: ""We put the paper in upside down and it's working now. I guess we just need to load the paper in upside down to make it work.""

I have since added to my checklist for printers:

1. Is it plugged in?
2. Is it turned on?
3. Is it REALLY plugged in?
4. Is the paper orientation correct?

230,Cursing the Printer from Hell,"Something very few people know about me is that when I get really stressed out I cuss hard enough that it would make a hardened sailor blush. Usually I am pretty good at keeping my temper in check but once the cat’s out of the bag I won’t stop until either a) the problem has corrected itself, or b) I run out of steam and/or languages to cuss in. For readability I have translated my four-language cussing tirade below into censored english.


It had been a particularly bad week at the fix-it shop, complete with rude customers, a 30-minute ‘ware scrub turning into a 6 hour marathon of quenching digital brushfires, getting one of my coworker's backlog dumped on me without warning, having my hours rearranged on the fly and one of the temps being extra sleazy towards me all week. All small things I could endure one at a time but everything happening so close together had the effect of grinding down my patience thinner than ice in the Sahara desert summer.


Then the Printer From Hell arrived.


It was a Brother printer, though I can’t remember exactly what model, only that it had a option to connect via wireless. The guy who brought it in said it would connect to wireless but a few seconds afterwards it would disconnect and had to be restarted to find the network again, only to drop the connection after a few second again. The warranty had run out and he had pulled some sob story about absolutely needing the printer fixed quickly and that he couldn’t afford a new one. 


Being young and naive I thought a printer couldn’t be that much of a problem to fix. I was sure it would be a quick fix and dug in with gusto, hooking it up to one of our loaners, downloading drivers and looking up settings. After i got connected via USB and al drivers installed i removed the USB cable and tried to connect it to the shop wireless. The connection looked fine and, naive as I was, I thought it had just been some problem with the guys drivers. Nope, there went the wireless connection down the drain. I restarted the printer and tried again.  
Connected, stable… aaand dropped connection. 


Several tries, downgraded driver versions and a lot of google-fu later I was at the end of my sanity. This piece of plastic and circuits taunted me with it’s pure existence. It’s stubborn refusal to keep the connection grated on my nerves like nothing before had. 
Why the temp guy chose this time to come up to me and be a sleazy a**hole I’ll never know. Maybe he lacked a sense of self preservation or he just didn’t care. 


&gt;”Hey beautiful, how about a deal: I fix that for you and you go on a date with me tomorrow. Wadda’ you say?”


No. Nope. Never ever in a million years. Like crystal glass struck juuust in the right spot my patience shattered into a million pieces and all the fury I had bottled up came spilling out with the result of something along the lines of: 


&gt;“Connect you d---l’s f---ing c---spawn piece of a--chewing s--tstain from s---ns da--ed and ruined a---hole! Connect or I shall tear open your cover and do unspeakable things to your innards you a--f---ed  
m----rf---er!”


All the while smacking the offending printer with my fist over and over until my hand hurt too much to continue. When I was done and out of breath I just slumped down on my chair and sat there glaring at it for several minutes. The temp guy looked like he had had a cute flower turn into a venomous snake in his hand and had backed off several meters.   

After I finally regained my composure I gave the printer another onceover. Power it down, unplug every cable possible, remove drivers, count to ten, reinsert the cables, power it up and reinstall drivers then connect it to the wireless and crossed my fingers. 


Connected, clear connection aaand… it stayed online. It actually stayed connected. I don’t know if it was the percussive maintenance or the complete powerdrain that fixed it but it was keeping the connection. I left in plugged in until the customer came to pick it up the next day and the printer kept its connection for that entire time.

231,"""I know everything about computers!""","So, this is my first post in a long time. This also didn't happen recently.

I go to a school where they encourage technological use (apart from using phones in class and what not) and we have computer class once a week. I'm not a hardware god, but I know enough to have built my own computer. This might as well count as a r/TIFU, brace yourselves.

So, even if this isn't exactly a real tech support job, I act as the tech support in my class since we live in a rural farming area in Ireland, where people are used to outside and nature and not sitting on their asses all day using a computer. So apart from the teacher, I am the most knowledgable in the class.

Well one day the teacher is absent, and lo and behold someone's computer isn't working. Our sub teacher (just another teacher who works at the school, a history teacher, who somehow knows less about history than she does computers (and she knows nothing about computers)) is supervising the class, and she goes over to the person who's computer isn't working. When she asks if anybody is good at computers, a couple of people mention me.

Not wanting to tarnish my reputation as ""master of all the things technology^TM"", and being the idiot that I sometimes am, I agreed.

I walked over, cracked my knuckles and looked at what was going on. Computer wouldn't turn on. ""Okay"" I thought to myself, simple enough. Should just be the cable in the back. I check the cable in the back, it's plugged in alright, and making the slight humming sound that those cables make. ""Maybe the switch?"", I ask. No, switch is turned on.

The teacher seeing I am having obvious trouble with solving the issue, tells me to stop and to go back to my seat, as I'm probably making it worse. That slightly pissed me off. ""Because, I knew the steps I needed to take to solve said issue. After all, I built my own computer. What have /these/ people done?"" /s

""Miss, I know everything about computers."" I say confidently.

I plug out the thing, cables and everything. (To the horror of my sub teacher, but after the last bold statement you'd have to have believed me.) monitor, mouse &amp; keyboard, 
 /EVERYTHING/. I tear off the side panels violently, and start getting to work. Unplug motherboard cable, cpu cable fan cable and all. Replug, in reverse order to try and test which thing is broken. To nobody's surprise after seeing such comedy, it still wouldn't turn on. Worse is I technically broke it at that point, because I opened it. She told me to go sit down, and I did the walk of shame to my seat and sat quietly (strange because I have this habit of speaking very loudly, which I'm working on) 

So a week passes, and the teacher has a talk with me. Turns out there was something wrong with the little coin battery in the motherboard, as well as some unplugged cable he wouldn't specify. I got off easy, but am now no longer trusted by any of the teachers when it comes to computers, which is a shame because it was going to be my next check on my list to solve the issue. But play stupid games win stupid prizes, I guess.

232,"""Only bad IT tells people to restart the computer""","TL:DR at the bottom.

Although I'm an IT Consultant, this didn't happen on the clock at work since I was on vacation at the time, but still a good one nonetheless.

Anyways, some good friends came down to visit from out-of-state and we get an Airbnb private place with a couple -of bedrooms and a living area with a big TV. One day after coming back from the beach we decide to watch a movie that my friend has downloaded onto his laptop. He takes the the HDMI cable that's running from the TV and plugs it into his laptop to get the display on the TV but nothing happens.

**Friend:** ""It's not coming up."" (*Messes with a few settings. Unplugs and re-plugs the cord in.*)

**Me:** (*IT mode kicks in*). ""Try Windows + P and select duplicate."" (*I'm walking over to make sure he's doing it right.*)

**Friend:** ""Nope not working either.""

(*I'm looking to make sure the TV's on and that its set to the correct HDMI.*)

**Me:** ""Go into the display settings on your laptop and see if it even detects the TV."" (*Nothing shows in there either.*)

As all of this is happening, I notice his computer is unusually slow for a decent gaming laptop. Takes a few moments for a simple display settings screen to come up. I think to myself that the next quickest step would be to do a reboot.

**Me:**  ""You know what? Go ahead and reboot your computer.""

(*Friend gets unusually annoyed at this request.*)

**Friend:** ""What?! No Dude.. Only bad IT tells people to restart the computer. There is some reason this is not working!""

(*He proceeds to ramble on how at his job, the 'bad' IT people will always tell people to reboot.*)

**Me:** (*Now insulted*) ""Actually, good IT will know when its appropriate to reboot and now is the time"".

(*He reluctantly agrees to do it but still annoyed about doing it*.)

**Me:** (*Still insulted*) ""There is a reason 'turning it off, turning it on' is a thing, and its because it fixes a lot of weird issues!""

We notice during the reboot that Windows is doing long updates which is a hint that he is not shutting down enough. According to him, he mostly just keeps his laptop asleep and closed when not using it. I may have a small thread of doubt that there is a 5% chance it still wont work and its like a bad display card or the TV HDMI port is busted but I'm confident the reboot will do the trick.

**Me:** ""When was the last time you shut this thing down?""

**Friend**: ""Maybe once every few weeks."" *(I'm thinking to myself. No wonder his sh\*\* ain't working.*)

After finishing its updates the moment of truth arrives and unsurprisingly, to me at least, the TV immediately gets the display on it right at the log in screen.

**Friend:** (*Looking somewhat defeated.)* ""Ugh! Why does that fix it? It makes no sense!""

(Keep in mind at work I don't get to be this blunt with users and I have to do everything with a grin on my face no matter how stupid it is so now I begin to teach a hard lesson. Also keep in mind that this particular friend loves to boast about his skills at his job nonstop and all the stuff he does so I get a little 'teachy' with him here.)

**Me:** (*This may not be exactly verbatim*) ""Because keeping it on long enough will cause system background stuff to gradually jump ship and stop working. Typically a reboot is the quickest and easiest way to get the operating system back to normal function. You need to shut it down at least once in a while. Also... only egotistical IT will 'try' and fix an issue like this by wasting everyone's time and screwing with the settings for hours on end instead of trying a reboot.""

(*I said all of this with a stern glare and stern voice but it felt good.*)

We proceed to watch the movie with no hard feelings. It felt good to show a little of my 'expertise' considering this particular friend talks non-stop about all the stuff he does at work and how good he is at his job and always talking about the programs he creates. I was incredibly insulted when someone who likes to boast about their career and skills insults mine so I pretty much threw the book at him during this whole fiasco.

**TL:DR** \- Friend plugs laptop into TV. No display comes up. Tell him to reboot. He gets mad and tells me only bad IT people recommend that. I get insulted. He reboots, and screen comes up on the TV. He sheepishly listens to me while I teach him a lesson about how IT is more about finding the best and quickest solution for the issue rather than assuming it can be done in some longer time consuming manner.

233,A Cat-6 cable...,"A cautionary tale.

I don't work in IT, but have used home computers for a long, long time. Coded 6502 and BASIC for a while. Even wrote some utility programs at work. At least I had the sense to realise I was only a fair amateur...

( KISS, no spaghetti code, REM and renumber, user interface says 'Please', 'Thank You', 'Sorry' and 'Pass n of m'.)

Our home network is hard-wired because the old house-bricks eat any signal that is not 'line of sight' to an access point.

The cable modem on this upstairs desk feeds a nice, dumb, metal-cased 8-way switch box, which feeds two PCs and an old HP all-in-one printer. Cables wander off to the rest of the house. Upstairs, there's a modern all-in-one A3 printer, a 'wide body'. Downstairs, concentrated by a couple of dumb 5-way switch boxes, there are a bunch of IP cameras, an old router/extender re-purposed as a switch+WAP, and a high-end Blu-Ray player. The latter had a wireless dongle, but the data rate was terrible. One spare cable later, it's happy.

So, middle of the evening, I'm working on my desk computers when family shout up that the Blu-Ray player has lost the network. Takes me a few minutes to confirm the correct menu options are still set, and there really is no connectivity. Takes me a little longer to notice some of the usual blinken lights on the switch+WAP don't. But the power is on.

Power off, mutter, mutter, mutter, power on. Self diagnostic blinkies mostly okay. The switcher is talking to downstream stuff, but ...

Fine. Back at desk, I open Chrome browser, access the switcher. Well, I tried. No network access. I've Internet access, that's okay. I run the IP scanner. That says that I've lost the downstairs stuff.

Has upstairs switcher glitched ? I can see the cables are all in place, but the one heading downstairs has a dark status blinky.

Power off, mutter, mutter, mutter, power on. Self diagnostic blinkies mostly okay. The switcher is talking to other downstream stuff, but not the downstairs cable...

Thus began four hours of hapless trouble-shooting, often escorted by our four tabby cats. Three spotty, one swirly, all free-spirits. And no, none of them had chewed on a cable or peed up a switcher. Or coughed a fur-ball into something expensive. Not this time...

Come 2 AM, I am slumped at desk. I've run out of things to try. The cable heading down-stairs was clipped to picture rails, ran under carpets and furniture, would take a miserable week to demount and replace. My free-lying 'proof of concept' cable had been a grade-A trip hazard. It even got me ! Never again, I'd been told.

The cats come to offer their sympathy. Up and down the desk, around and around and around.

They love watching modem and switcher blinken lights. 

Boss cat reaches a paw, extends a claw, tags a Cat-6's clip.

Out comes the plug.

NOW I understand.

I run down-stairs, prepare three fresh bowls of catfood.

Then I go back to my desk and carefully unplug, firmly replace EVERY network cable I can reach. Turns out several were unlatched, but one had crept just enough to disconnect. Yes, that one...

234,"The classic, ""I can't log in!""","This is something that will always stick with me, and I'm glad I found this sub so I can share it with y'all.

It was about 3 years ago- I got hired onto an entry desktop support position at a call center office, and my boss had me coming in for the morning shift to handle the easy morning stuff. The morning shift would only be myself, and the tasks were simple things like unlocking/resetting passwords, reimaging PCs and walking the sales floor to make sure things were greased up and running before the rest of the team came.

In the early mornings, this call center holds training classes and orientation sessions for their new hires. Now, this one particular morning, I received a call from one of the trainers, we'll call him David. I would bump into David every now and then during my floor walks, and he seemed to know what he was doing. Mind you, I was still a noob, trying to read out how the people were, how the flow of the office was, etc. 

So David calls me and says that one of his agents can't log in. I do the usual, ask for the agent's username and reset their password. He insists that the agent has tried multiple times, and is still not able to log in.

Now, I'm not seeing that the account is locked in AD, so I asked for the computer name so I can remote over to check. He says he doesn't know the computer name and if I could just come to the training room to help because he's busy.

I figured why not since there's not much action happening at 5AM besides YouTube on my monitor. I head into the training class, and David's running around trying to help all the new folks, then glances over at me. He waves me down and leads me over to the agent.

David - ""Yea, she's the one that can't log in, help her out please.""

Myself - ""Alright lets see, may you go ahead and try logging in...""

The agent, early 20s, proceeds to enter her credentials. Typing in her username and password, one key after another with her index finger. I was told by my supervisor, that this office has a high attrition rate, and now I could see why.

After the agent typed in her username on that crisp Windows 7 login screen, she lifts her right hand over to firmly hold onto the mouse, then moving it down to click on the password field. Of course, in my mind, I'm just saying press Tab, but that'd be too easy.

She goes on to type in her password, and then once again, gets a hold of the mouse and gracefully hovers that there cursor over the 'Cancel' button and clicks on it with finesse. During this moment, time seriously slowed down so much, I could hear my neck creak and my teeth grind. 

I didn't believe that actually just happened, I thought it was a mistake, so I had her input her credentials again. We run it back once more, and AGAIN, she hovers over 'Cancel.' I had to cut in and say, 'No no no no....click on the arrow.' All of this, and no password reset nor an account unlock was needed.

I glanced over at David, and he didn't care at what had just happened. He only said, ""Awesome, she's logged in, great!"" and moved on. I learned a lot from that day, and that office. I also learned very much that there were more trainers like David. All in all, lots of tales, but that one tops it for me at that office.

Me: why would you unplug from the wall jack and plug that end in to your laptop?

User: I don't know

So I unplug the Ethernet from the laptop and plug back in to the proper wall jack, boom WAP is comes alive.

I translated the text, and expected to see the same nicely-formatted output we get in English and...it's trash. Half the rows are deleted, nothing is formatted right, and it's a mess. So, time to figure out what's going on. I look at the formulas, and most of them seem to be working fine, but there's a couple oddities. All the text formatting is right, but anything based on numbers(e.g., ""are any of these greater than zero?"") is failing. 

Quebec uses number styles differ from English-speaking Canada. We would write a thousand as ""1,000"", while they write it as ""1 000"". Simple enough for most purposes, but these numbers are being put into an Excel sheet, and that means Excel needs to treat them as numbers. And it seems that to Excel, ""1 000"" is a text string - it can use commas to separate digit groups, but not spaces. 

Okay, let's fix that. A bit of text substitution to clean out the spaces, and it's coming through as ""1000"" - that should be a number, right? Weirdly enough, no, it's not - IF(1000&gt;0) is still coming out false. So I try another text-cleaning approach, and then I check it by adding something to the result. I figure that if addition works, it's a number, right? 

Sure enough, addition works fine. 1000+1 = 1001, so we're good. Except that, when I look at the final output, we're not good. Something is clearly wrong, and when I dig through it turns out to be a ""find the largest of these"" function - the largest one of a group of five positive numbers is zero. However, the one that I tested by adding one to it, that one(and *only* that one) works fine. It seems that a string of digits from a text function isn't *really* a number in Excel's mind, but the result of an addition is. 

I ponder this for a minute, and then realize what I need to do. In the cells where I'm doing the text cleaning, I go in and add ""+0"" to all of the cells I'm doing the text cleaning in. And sure enough, everything is a number now, and it all works perfectly. 

Sometimes the fix is even stupider than the problem. ",False,331,123,Alsadius,talesfromtechsupport
238,Email troubles,"We finally moved all of our email services to Exchange/Office 365. The final migration was this past weekend, which means service accounts can be their own Exchange accounts now that are added separately to email clients (most service accounts are permission-based by a list of users, and will automatically show up as a second inbox without any extra steps; some were created as a secondary account based on the need).

My manager stopped by my desk this morning and asked me to call someone in the President's Office, let's call her AA for Administrative Assistant. I was a bit a confused because I was already working on a different ticket for AA, even if it was for a different computer this person sometimes mentions multiple issues while she's on the phone with you. I call AA and ask to remote in to see what's happening. As she's explaining what's happening, she also sends me the error message she got.

&gt;$AA: I was trying to send this email to our Board of Trustees and it failed, but when I sent a test to my Gmail, it went through fine.

I looked at the error message, looked at what she was doing, and almost immediately figured it out. She had her email, Old Secretary (OS) which went through our pop server and New Secretary (NS), which went through Exchange. It was trying to send through the OS and she didn't change the ""From"" option. I couldn't just remove the OS account because there was some mail saved locally in that account that needed to be moved to Exchange, so I named it appropriately, so that she knew which inbox was old and new, but this didn't reflect on the ""From"" field in a new email. Even when I showed her how to distinguish between them (the old one had her name on it, the new one had Secretary), she said she understood but didn't seem to.

I asked her to try sending the email again, and either it would go through with no problem and they'd receive it, or it wouldn't again and they wouldn't know an email was being sent. She said she'd test it again and call me back. Once she called me back, she did the same thing with trying to send from the old account. I had to show her again how to change it, then I figured out it was defaulting to that because she was in the OS folder. I explained this to her and recommended being in the email she intended to send from, when sending a new email. I think she understood this time.

One day, he was walking past one of their copiers, one of those big Xerox machines they had back then and that some of us still support now. One of the secretaries had taken a keyboard, flipped it on its face, and was scanning it.

240,When more magic is the solution,"Since you guys enjoyed my previous story i’d thought i’d chuck another one in here for good luck. 

Some of you have encountered the (in)famous “Tech Aura”. That subtle invisible field around some people that causes misbehaving tech to straighten up and look smart just by being near whatever it is that is giving you grief. This isn’t really a story about tech aura, but something on a similar wavelength.


Another day at the local fix-it shop, tackling anything from simple ‘ware clean-ups to complete overhauls. We did mostly computer stuff but sometimes we took on special cases. This is about one of those special cases. 


Some guy had dropped off a two, maybe three, year old 50gb mp3 player/portable drive combination that was dead as a doorknob. Again I was the only one not elbow deep in hardware guts so I got the dubious honor of poking and prodding it to see if we could scare it back to life or at least recover the data from it.   
Well after much serious poking and some hard prodding I was ready to chuck it in the bin and call it a day. Nothing I could think of would make it turn on or even show any hint of charging. All that was left was a complete dismantle and inspection of every minute part, which would take up far more time than I was willing to give up that day. 


Then a thought struck me. When all else fails we IT folks tend to joke around about sacrifices and dark IT gods. Guess it couldn’t hurt to give it a try before I condemned the thing to the bin of lost hopes, bad dreams and unsalvageable tech. 


It was the work of moments to swipe a blank A4 from the printer, draw a decent pentagram on it and put the offending mp3 player in the middle. I grabbed the “killer cord”, a straight 120v-to-modular-charger one of the guy had made as a joke, folded my hands into the sign of the cog, recited some stuff about the glorious machine spirit (yay for being a Warhammer 40.000 nerd!) and plugged in the killer cord. 


**SNAP**  


**CRACKLE**  


**HISS**  


I yanked out the killer cord before it could start a fire and was about to toss the mp3 player when I figured I’d try to turn it on a final time. One press on the ON button and I almost dropped it out of shock when the device booted up with a jaunty start-up jingle. It worked.   Somehow it worked.   
One of the guys that had walked by my station and stopped to look at what I was doing was staring at me like I had resurrected a dead hamster in front of him. And that's why I got the nickname Tech Witch.

A user appears in the corner of my eye.


""Oh IT!"" he says. I do have an actual name but I don't think he has bothered to learn it yet. ""The printer out the back is not working.""


Ah the old ""not working"" fault description. My absolute favourite. Never mind the ticketing system I've shown him how to use and asked him to log tickets with multiple times. Bailing me up on my break or in the hallways is much easier to do I guess.

""Sure I'll take a look at it after my coffee."" I manage to say through gritted teeth, ignoring my top two pet hates. No real description, no ticket. Not calling me by my name was the icing on the cake. I've already internally decided not to ask any more details on the problem. I'm off the clock and I'm yet to ingest any caffeine at this point.

Hoping that this interaction is over, my attention is turned back to the coffee machine.

""I'm sorry?"" I stutter confused and caffineless.

""I'm sorry I'm not following..."" I trail off, brow furrowed in bewilderment.

""Do you think it could be the wireless?""comes the response 

""For fuck sake... I don't fucking know! You just literally told me about the issue. The printer is on the other side of the  factory. I can't fucking diagnose  the issue from here. Not withstanding you told me nothing about the actual problem itself. How about some symptoms? Be more descriptive man! Besides, can you see I'm on my break.

244,Transferring data and the importance of reading,"I work for a large phone manufacturer and a while ago I spoke to a lady who was trying to transfer data from a very old phone to a very new one. Doing this involves transferring data from the old phone to a computer program that will then connect to another program that can download it into the new phone, which isn't as complicated as it sounds if you follow the instructions we can provide you with.

This woman has however been struggling with it for quite a while and has called us several times before. It becomes obvious why only a few minutes into the call when it turns out that she asks unrelated “why”-questions about everything, doesn't really listen when you answer her questions and wants to read everything that she sees on the screen out loud to you. If you interrupt her she'll tell you to ""please let her finish"" and starts over. So, as you can imagine this becomes a rather long winded call, but after struggling for a little while we manage to transfer her data to the first program without any major incidents.

By then I've asked her perhaps two or three times if she's installed both programs and has both cables close at hand since her phones use different cables, which she says she has. She goes to plug the new phone into her computer.

&gt;C: “It’s broken! The cable doesn’t fit anymore.”

&gt;Me: “Are you using the cable you received with the new phone?”

&gt;C: “No, why do I have to do that?”

&gt;Me: “As I said earlier you have to use the cable you received with the new phone because the old one doesn’t fit.”

&gt;C: “I've plugged it into the computer now and nothing has changed.”

&gt;Me: “OK, so the program looks exactly the same as it did before you plugged it in? Is there a notification on your phone?”

&gt;C: “No, it only says…”

She starts reading the program’s generic welcome text, which pretty much only tells you how to use it and what it can do, out loud to me. After she’s finished we do quite a bit of trouble shooting, which includes restarting everything, checking the cable and connections and asking the customer to reinstall the computer program, but despite everything it’s still stuck on the same screen. So nothing has changed, and the customer is getting a bit upset. We're about 30-40 minutes into the call by then, and about 20 minutes into my lunch break.

&gt;C: “I’ve done everything now, why can’t you just fix this? I never had this issue with my [phone from other brand]! If you can't solve this within the next ten minutes I'll just throw away this phone and never by anything from you again.”

&gt;Me: “I’m sorry that it’s taking a bit longer than expected to fix this issue, but I am trying to solve it as soon as possible. Just to check, are you entirely sure that you can’t see anything else in the program that wasn’t there earlier?”

245,More from Aviation Maintenance: Language Barriers,"While in Germany, as I’ve mentioned on occasion, I found myself in charge of the POL (Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants—aka, Hazardous Materials) program and cabinets for my Company as well as the Tool Room.  Between the two jobs as well as any engine work that came up, I was rather busy and was in dire need of an assistant.  Towards the last eight months or so of my time there, we had a new Private First Class (PFC) show up and he was given to me by the Platoon Sergeant to answer my prayers.  

Unfortunately, PFC Delmonte (Like the fruit brand…reminds me of his name) just added to my workload instead of lightening it.

PFC Delmonte was a Power Train (transmission) mechanic from Puerto Rico by way of New York City and really didn’t care for the Army.  This was his first post-training assignment, but he’d already figured out how to game the system.  When he arrived he put on a show of not being able to understand much English (How on earth did you enlist, then?!) and therefore, was required to be accommodated with ESL (English as a Second Language) classes.  After work in the barracks?  Could hang out and BS with us all day.  Get him in the shop?  No hablo ingles.

I learned quickly he seldom cared about much to do with work and was mostly disengaged.  I was able to prove this theory once while we were painting a grill my squadleader, KG, had built from aircraft stands, a wall locker and a 55 galllon drum.  The plan had been to paint the whole thing black using some spray paint I had in excess, and seeing how I had too much to do that I didn’t want to putz around with this all day, I grabbed Delmonte and had him help me out. 

Watching him handle the spraycan, something piqued my familiarity.  Having grown up in some unsavory areas, I realized he wasn’t actually spraying the grill—he was *tagging* it.  Smiling evily, I waited as he became engrossed in what he was doing before suddenly shouting.

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Oh, %$&amp;@, it’s the cops!”

He threw that can one direction and started sprinting away across the airfield in the opposite direction.  

***
Needless to say, I realized from his behavior that he wasn’t always the sharpest tool in addition to his lack of care for his duties.  The best place for him would be checking in and out tools from the tool room.   He wouldn’t get into too much trouble in there, and would “expose him to more English.”

Around this time, in order to combat people using inappropriate secondary containment for solvents (and provide tighter inventory control in general) I had implemented a check-out policy from the POL lockers. Mechanics would have to go to the tool room to check out spray bottles of the various solvents.  It would be the responsibility of the person running the tool room to check those items out as well, since the lockers were right next to the tool room.  

One afternoon, while I was working on an engine swap on one of our Blackhawks, there was a commotion down by the ‘hell hole’ in the tail boom.  A mechanic was sliding out of the underside access panel, obviously dizzy and disoriented, holding onto a bottle of solvent.  I climbed down to help him and determine what chemical he’d just obviously been unintentionally huffing—you see, the “hell hole”  is a very tight space right where the tail boom of the helicopter joins with the main body of the fuselage.  The ventilation in there is poor, so one needs to exercise caution in any solvents they might be using since the wrong stuff could create a very dangerous atmosphere in short order.  

I looked at the bottle and did a doubletake.  

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Snuffy, just what the hell were you doing spraying this in there?!”

&gt;**PFC Snuffy** “I was trying to clean it up…”

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “You’re supposed to use Isopropyl for that!”

&gt;**PFC Snuffy** “I did!”

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “No, this is Trichloroethylene!  You’re lucky you didn’t pass out and die in there!”

&gt;**PFC Snuffy** “Well that’s what Delmonte gave me…”

My head whipped over to the tool room, where I saw him casually not caring about what was transpiring mere feet away.  

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Delmonte.  WTF.  He asked for Isopropyl, and you gave him trike?!”

He shrugged.

&gt;**Delmonte** “So?”

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Snuffy could have *died*. Did you even look at the bottle?”  

&gt;**Delmonte** “No.”
 

He didn’t look like he cared too much.  After that, I took away his POL locker key and made everyone come to me, instead.  He got a little piece of paper telling him to be careful, but due to his ‘language barrier’ they couldn’t actually punish him for negligence.

248,Server Broke Computer FIX ASAP,"Alt account due to colleagues i’d rather not have know of this recognising my main account


This tale takes place back in ’09 when i was but a pimple-faced young girl fresh out of uni, with a head full of big ideas and booklearning but shy of any kind of hands-on experience.

I had taken up work as a part-time IT fixer at a local fix-it shop straight out of uni. The hours were bad and the culture was severely leaning towards the “sleazy old pervert” side of the spectrum but it paid rent at least. To be fair I did dress somewhat provocative, as I like having a touch of femininity in such a male dominated area. Besides, I had gone through a bad breakup a few months before and some primal part of me enjoyed the attention I got from my male colleagues. But I digress, so on with the story. 

I was enjoying a quiet Friday afternoon, lazily browsing some goth clothing webstore or another when my boss poked his head in and told me he had a customer in need of on-site support ASAP and since everyone else was either busy with other things or on vacation it was my lucky day. He tossed me a crumpled piece of paper with an adress on it and the words “Server broke computer FIX ASAP” on it. 


A server that broke a computer? I had heard about the reverse happening with bad setups but this was something new for me. I decided to go all in on this to show my boss I actually knew my way around IT so I grabbed a toolbox and rammed everything i could think of needing in it. Recovery discs, ‘ware killer USBs, extra cables, screwdrivers, pliers, anything that could be remotely useful in bringing a downed computer back to life went into the toolbox. Once I had packed everything but the kitchen sink I got in my car and headed out to the adress on the paper.


The adress ended up being a strip club in the bad part of town. Not really what I had envisioned when I headed out but a customer is a customer, right? The bouncer let me in through the back door and I began my search for the downed computer. A quick chat with the bartender and he showed me a small office in the back. On the desk stood a Dell that looked like it had been dunked in a swimmingpool, complete with a small puddle spreading out on the desk around it and a big wet spot on the floor. When I asked the bartender what happened and how a faulty server could cause a minor flooding he nearly bent over double with laughter. It wasn’t a case of a IT server choking and dragging a computer down with it, but a case of one of the serving girls watering a potted plant near on the desk and fumbled the pitcher of water all over the computer on the floor next to the desk. 


Well, the poor computer was busted alright. Nothing I could do to save it but bring it back to the shop and fetch a loaner for them while we attempted to recover what we could. When I returned with the loaner I had to take a shortcut through the area the showgirls used to prep for the show and damn was that place bustling. Some guy (I’m guessing the manager) even tossed me a skimpy shirt a few sizes too small for my bust and told me to get ready for stage when I was heading back out after plugging in their loaner. I tossed it back, told him about the computer and headed back to the shop to clock out. To be frank I kind of took it as a compliment that some guy thought me good looking enough to be on stage so I never told my boss about that part when he asked how the job went on Monday.

Well, it turns out that said admin person had took it upon herself to compact the database on a weekly basis while she worked for the Agency as a form of maintenance. So after months of her being gone from the company, the size of the database had grown to 2GB? Not too shaby for a database, eh? Well, of course I wouldn't be typing up this Tale if that was the case.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**$Savy:** ...this...this isn't a database; it's an abomination!!!  
&gt;**$LawnGnome:** What??  
&gt;**$Savy:** The whole thing is built on Microsoft Access!  
&gt;**$LawnGnome:** What do we do?!  
&gt;**$Savy:** We're gonna need some candles and possibly an intern to sacrifice to the IT gods.  
&gt;**$LawnGnome:** ....for real?  
&gt;**$Savy:** What? No, but just we need to call their director and let her know what's going on.  

&amp;nbsp;

*[insert montage of everyone running around and screaming]*  

&amp;nbsp;

To add to the complexity of the situation, the ""database"" had multiple versions of itself on the shared drive, and no one knew which was the original database. Further the issue with custom FrontEnds being developed for each individual staff member that was pointing them to all different copies of the database. How do we go about fixing this?  

* 1. Cry  
* 2. Salvage the database  
* 3. Identify the master copy and obliterate the impostors  
* 4. Do the same for all the FrontEnd databases  

&amp;nbsp;

We managed to barely squeeze some life out of the database by compacting it from its hard cap of 2.00GB to a walloping 1.96GB which was enough to open the database again. We normalized everyone's FrontEnd shortcuts so that everyone would point and work out of the same copy of the database. 

&amp;nbsp;

**So...No Interns were harmed in the making of this Tale?**  
After a thumbs up check we reported back to the Director and let her know that the database is stable but is no longer something we could support and that the database would fail again if no action was taken. She was happy that we brought this issue to her attention and assured us that she had contacted a developer to migrate the database to a more suitable platform. The kicker? That very same director ended up retiring a month after she made that promise to us.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL:DR:** Someone had the brilliant idea to turn Access into their org's mission-critical database and let it reach the 2GB hard cap. Hilarity and Panic ensues.

250,Tales from Desktop Support - Printer Edition,"Hello fellow system supporters, tech teams, and printer punchers!   
I have a few short printer tales because The Cutover Part 3 is still a work in progress. 

  
**The one where a camera company made printers.**  
It's not Canon, but another one that was popular in the 35mm film era. 

To start, the service tech does not believe in DHCP, says it's too unreliable.  
So this company buys 20 of them anyways, tech pulled an IP and then set the printers to hold that IP static, the PC team didn't know the glaring problem with the method used until it was too late. We like to make note about printers if people will tell us about them. 

IT comes along later and re-maps the IP schema for various reasons (new hardware, getting rid of outdated technology/servers/etc.) It happens, deal with the fallout of not following protocol. 

The screams of offline printers may still haunt the dreams of those poor technicians...

The only way to resolve it?  
Renew lease on printerOS?  
Ha!  
You had to shut down the printer, power down the subsystem, and then flip the main switch to drain all residual charge.  
Then and only then would it refresh it's IP address.  


**The one that took 30 minutes to install-**

HP's Laserjet 400 pro series is by far one of the most annoying designs ever as it like to switch to Russian, it's heavy, and the driver installer is weird. I followed protocol, tried the simple driver first, it failed and made the mistake of using the full-installer. 

The installer did nothing for 30 minutes, but managed to load the print driver in less than 10 seconds! 

I cancelled the install hoping it would just stop at that point and let me load the proper HP software after the Sysadmins re-packaged HP's crap. 

Nope! Rookie mistake!  
Driver terminated  
\*Windows Chime\*

New device detected - Discovering drivers now.  
\*Standard Windows Error\*  
Tell me what it is! I know nothing!

I sigh and resign to watching the screen for 30 more minutes.  
It finally worked, but it took so long to do so much nothing.   


**The Russian printer:**  
In a new office suite, there are two identical printers located in adjacent offices and one of them decided to switch to Russian, we're not sure why or how, but it was odd. Even though I have a fantastic on-demand Russian accent for being an American, it was not enough to read or understand Cyrillic.

I tried the konami code on it by stepping through the second printer's English menu to change the language.

No dice, something wasn't quite right with the order in the menu. 

Aha! Try Google Translate! 

That was really hard because of the constant up/down at the desk/matching my English keyboard to the Russian characters.

I finally reach enlightenment and remember now Google has a camera translator! After some very oddly spelled words, I got close enough to find the proper language menu and set it english.

251,Band and his merry cluster of 365 initiates,"Before we begin, allow me to introduce the players in this round:  


Band: There was a time that Quantum was a professor at a local community college. Band was one of his better students, which helped to get him into $themed. Band was a clever guy, started as an intern a little after I did. Wasn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, able to keep up the pace with more complicated tasks, all around good guy. In the interim between the time I left $themed from being an intern to finishing my Bachelor’s degree and coming back, Band had become a real boy, as some other tech had left and he’d moved into their position, and if I recall correctly, he’d actually gotten a promotion to an analyst at the point this story takes place. If not, he was the highest level of technician that $themed had to offer.  


Buchji: Buchji was the IT guy for the Pharmacy. Started as a pharmacy tech (actually dealing with drugs and such) long before I got my first taste of technology. He eventually fell into the IT role for the pharmacy and through a long and complicated tunnel he dug his way through to the IT side of the house as opposed to the Pharmacy side of the house. Being the pharmacy tech, he had his own office with all kinds of stuff that normal techs didn’t have access to for various reasons. I first met Buchji when I was an intern and thought he was just an angry older dude. What I could have never told you is that he and I would become the absolute best friends, literally doing magic and successfully doing the impossible. He and I became the dream team, if someone else couldn’t figure it out, they fielded it to Buchji and me, and we would figure it out. There was literally no problem that we were given that we didn’t at one point or another find a proper resolution to. At this point in the overarching story though, we’d worked together a lot and were very good friends, but we hadn’t figured out the capabilities we had when we worked together just yet.  


Turtle: Turtle was my direct boss. He and my father had been friends for years, and by extension he knew me. He and $Heart (his boss) worked with my dad for years and helped me get my foot in the door. Turtle loved to give us hell about all kinds of things, but would always come through in a pinch or when you needed him. 10/10 fantastic boss, would work for again.  


Tinker: Tinker was a higher level technician, on the same level as Band. He’s known for being super good at tinkering. He was incredible with electronics and soldering and fixing broken… pretty much anything. He was also very good at hardware (computer and otherwise) modification. He’s also \*the\* guy that $CEO calls when anything is wrong with anything technological she has.  


Wykydtron: The AVP of Information Technology at $themed.  


$CEO: The CEO of $themed.&lt;/p&gt;  


\*It is also important to note if you’ve not worked in a Hospital/environment before, there are software suites all over the place that depend on ancient software to run properly. Some of them still exist because the Hospital doesn’t want to buy something else if the old system works (even if it is the worst kind of security vulnerability), or the vendor is no longer in business or supporting the software in question, and no one could find something that works better.\*  


\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Our story begins on day like any other, I had just walked in the office for the morning and was browsing through ticket queue and finishing a rebuild for a user whose hard drive had died. I’m tired, its 7AM, and I hadn’t gotten my morning can of $energydrink (green/original, for those wondering). I skim through the ticket que and determine that nothing major is going on at the moment, and head to go grab a can of $energydrink and breakfast from the on campus café.  


On my way, I knock on Buchji’s office door and check in on him for the morning, as he was on the way, and offered to get him breakfast if he was interested. He politely obliged and we headed off. We made it to the café and got our breakfast/$energydrink and proceeded back to my office. Not a minute after we’d sat down (it’s around 8:30AM at this point), Turtle walks in and is literally freaking out about a call he’d just gotten from Wykydtron that $CEO doesn’t have office on her computer anymore, but it wasn’t just her, it was all of $Administration. Turtle proceeds to dispatch Tinker to go check on $Administration and $CEO and figure out what is going on.  


It was about that time I turned back to my breakfast/ticket que and I realize that the flood gates have opened. It wasn’t just $Administration that had been hit by whatever it was that took out office, it was the entire environment. I quickly proceeded to scarf down my breakfast and I believe it was the fastest I’d ever chugged $energydrink, but I knew it was going to be an incredibly long day and the sooner I got started, the better off I was going to be.  


Not having been informed on exactly what happened, I start to ask questions. As a group we often talked about the goings on and changes that were going to be made to the environment, as my team was the one that the desktop images/updates/patches/changes lived with. Band was actually the guy using $softwaresuite to allow us to mass deploy updates and patches and deal with asset management. It was planned that there was a clearly defined list of 80 devices on 4 floors of $themed that were going to have $OldOfficesuites forcibly removed and have $OnlineOfficesuite pushed to them without technician intervention. The initial tests in our office had gone off without a hitch and Band was prepared to test on a larger group of users, but not something so big that, if it went wrong, the team would suffer brutally. We, as a collective, tried to automate everything we could automate to make life a little easier for the techs. Quantum and The Sailor had already moved on from $themed to their next big jobs at $Fortune100. Between Chewy, Band, Honey Badger, Macguy and $me, there was plenty of custom software to go around. Those guys, as well as the rest of the crew will come in other stories though.  


What was intended and what actually happened were quite different though, if you haven’t caught on just yet. What actually happened was that $softwaresuite lost the file that clearly defined the 80 devices that were supposed to be our test environment, and as opposed to just stopping and asking questions like a good software should, it fired off to every device in the environment, and there was nothing we could do to stop it by the time we realized it. All we could do at that point is man our machines and try to reinstall everything we could as quickly as we could.  


It was impossible to get through all of the tickets (as there are 10,000 devices and 15 of us techs, only 11 of which were allocated to deal with tickets) that came in that day, but we did as well as we could. The next morning we came in, we found that a huge portion of those tickets we’d closed the day before were reopened. After further investigation, we found that $softwaresuite was still pushing the delete/uninstall command and had been all night.  


Awesome.  


We dug in and found the way to stop the delete scripts from being pushed out to more devices, but the damage had been done, and we actually ended up spending almost 2 months to get $OnlineOfficesuite redeployed by hand. And while you’re wondering why we didn’t just use $softwaresuite to push out $OnlineOfficesuite, we tried that but ran into catastrophic failure on devices that had the original scripts pushed to them.  


We finally did get everything back to where it was intended, it was just not exactly how we intended to happen the way that it did. It was that incident though that made us shape up our Incident Response plans and make sure we were well prepared and had a plan of attack for if anything like th… \*snickers\* who am I kidding? Management didn’t learn any lessons from that incident, and it was actually just in the last couple of weeks that $themed got hit by an \*actual\* cyber-attack. From what I could tell, resolution tactics were the same and took an extended period of time with all of the techs available to issue proper resolution to that issue.  


Tl;Dr: Had a software suite powerful enough to push changes to save techs a lot of time upgrading to a new suite of products. Had a clearly defined parameter of “wild” machines to test on. Parameters lost, software suite shits bed, techs end up spending 2 months doing the job that should have been paced for around 6 months as emergency countermeasures. Management learns nothing.  


As a last note, during that two months there was a lot of day drinking ($soonMhine, for those curious) and a lot of frustration, but also a lot of pizza from $bestlocalpizzajoint, because morale was super low. We got through it and Band kept his job, and is actually still working for $themed. He hasn’t caused an incident like that since.

252,That one dude you knew back in high school.,"Hey guys this is my firstish time posting here. I know you all love a good ""oh you're good with computers could you help me with this &lt;idea that sounds great but has zero planning and understanding of the time involved&gt;""

It's not quite tech support but since I'm in computer repair and always end up fielding everyone's computer repair and programming questions I'm sure you all can relate. 


Anyway. I'll be me. 

F1: that friend whom I've kept in contact with since high school 

F2: guy I barely know who's a friend of F1 


The other day I got a text from F1 saying that F2 had some questions about crypto currency and wanted to know if he could give F2 my number. 

No big deal I don't mind answering some questions about new cool snazzy tech. This won't be too bad maybe a short phone conversation with a brief overview of how crypto works. I couldn't have been more wrong... 

I get this text:

F2:
&gt; Hey, this is F2. We went to high school together. I am wondering if you are proficient in C++ coding. If so, would you be interested in helping me develop a crypto currency if you like the idea?

WAIT JUST A SECOND! I'VE BEEN HAD.

This is just like any old friend who knows you're good with computers asking if you could write this ""cool app"" they had an idea for and nothing else.

I was busy at the time and told him I'd call him later and ended up getting this: 

F2: 
&gt; Idea isn't really developed enough to talk about yet, and truly gather your interest actually. But, are you good enough at C++ to help code a complicated coin? 

UGH. 

Anyway. Time to break the news. 

ME:
&gt; I would use Rust which is similar. And I usually don't do coding projects for people unless they have a fleshed out well designed plan. 

And then hit him with some reality. 

ME:
&gt; Like what kind of algorithm will you use, what kind of miners are you targeting? What niche is it for? There's a lot of planning before coding.

I need you to walk with me to my office right this instant to help me.""  This morning was no exception as I saw two non 7am employees talking in the parking lot (my spidey sense was tingling)

Right as I walk out of the stairwell on my floor, I walk right past one of the users that I had seen in the parking lot.

**User** **-** ""Hey! You're in IT right?""

**TechCHUD** **-** ""Yeah, I'm in IT""

**TechCHUD -** ""That's great, I'll get to that as soon as I can""

*Got to the office and I'm reading the tickets to try and suss out which one of these sounds like an install for this user whose name I don't know nor do I care to know. Hair stands up on my neck and suddenly the same user is in my office again*

**User -** ""I need you to come install this now.""

**TechCHUD -** ""Yeah, so I have all the unassigned tickets and I'm working them.  What is you're ticket number""

**User -** ""Are you serious, you're really going to make me get the ti-""

**TechCHUD -** ""Absolutely, gonna need the number so I can get the info""

*\*The user stormed off in a huff and walked back in rattling off just a random assortment of numbers at me as he came back in\** 

**TechCHUD -** ""So I'm gonna need those letters ahead of those numbers you just rattled off.  They do matter."" (it's almost as if I really need this and am not some heartless bureaucratic drone)

**User -** ""REQITM\*\*\*\*\*\*

**TechCHUD -** ""Yeah, your asking for Snag-It, this purchase isn't approved, it requires a license that I don't have.  I have Greenshot and Snipping Tool which can do pretty much the same thing""

*\*Enter NewDev I onboarded last week\**

**Exec -** ""We need this, I need you to install this.  I need you to install it now even if it's a trial.  I don't care, I will purchase a license personally if I need/want to to activate it""

I'll be honest, I just installed the trial and spent the rest of my day docked in a sick employees office to avoid them.

Here's the kicker - The exec that came in demanding was *not* the one they were making a powerpoint for either.  As it turned out, she was the one that hadn't approved the request to purchase the license that was both cheap and easily sourced by our procurement tech.

The Dark Abyss of Ignorance is a deep and dreary place, and it shall never cease to amaze me... Here is:

**You Should Change Your Country Code**


“Welcome to IT-Service desk, how can I help you?”

“Yes, hello! I’m site administrator of our computers at [your average small-town], and I can’t access CertainWebEnvironment since this Friday!”

*I get her user-ID. I start looking up what might have gone wrong, while she howls loudly from The Dark Abyss of Ignorance.*

“I can’t believe how slow everything is loading today!”

“Yeah, sometimes the computers get slow when it’s warm…”

*Most users accept this as a piece of small-talk-information. Not her, though… She’s too smart for me!*

“Yeah, well, it’s not warm in here – we have air conditioning in our office! Don’t you have AC in yours? That’s not why – usually when this many people are on vacation, it’s not this slow! Have you guys done something with the computers lately?”

“Have we made your computers slow, Ma’am..? No, I really don’t think that we have…”

“Well, it sure as day wasn’t me! Ah, and look at this, it doesn’t work! I can’t access WebEnvironment! And when I did have access to it three days ago, it looked weird!”

“All right – let’s have a look at what might be the issue! Can you tell me the error message, please?”

“It says I need permission to access the site – but I **have** permission! I’m **site administrator**! Something’s happened to WebEnvironment during the weekend, and it’s not my fault!”

“No, no, that wouldn’t be your fault… Let’s see what we can do here. Is your computer in working order otherwise?”

“Well… No!”

“it isn't?”

“I told you, they’re all slower than usual!”

“All right… Um, we could try and clean it up a bit – clear clutter from your hard drive, restart it – because that’s pretty important to a computer. It doesn’t like being on for too long, especially when it’s warm.”

“What? I *have* turned it off. Please don’t make assumptions that it’s *my* fault my computer is slow!”

*I mute and sigh deeply at how adamant she is about how this is not her fault.*

“All right, Ma’am, it was only a suggestion…”

*I mumble something about annoying bitches. I let it run off me.*

“Can I get your computer’s PN-number, please?”

“Is that gonna help with my WebEnvironment?”

*I bite my teeth together. Perhaps I should take her physical address from our system and have someone send her a big box of halfway decomposed frogs…*

“All right, Ma’am, this is how it works – you tell me exactly what’s going on with WebEnvironment and I’ll do my absolute best to help you.” 

“Yes – that’s what we’ll do!”

*Mute, in case of word diarrhea. I hear her click and huff and puff from The Abyss. She’s so flustered about not getting in, it would almost be heart breaking – if I weren't an extremely well-trained robot with a heart filled with titanium gears.*

“There! I can’t get in, and it says, “Need permission to access site” – but I have permission! I’m *site administrator*!”

*I mute, and I facepalm.*

“Have you ordered an admin account, Ma’am?”

“What do you mean? It’s the same account I always use!”

“Yes, I understand it is - but have you ordered *admin access* to this particular part of WebEnvironment?”

“No, I haven’t!”

*She laughs. She laughs at me for my stupid, stupid, very relevant question.*

“Then, if what you wish to do is get in here as admin, you need to order admin permissions…”

“What do you mean? I’ve been site admin for a very long time and I’ve never had to order any rights!”

“Well, it is a bit of a new procedure having to order thigs this particular way, but it has saved the company resources and time, for example, not having to install software on computers that the employees don’t even use or give accesses to people who don’t need them. And that you are admin of your *site* unfortunately doesn’t give you admin rights to Web Based Environments that affect a broad range of people and functions.” 

*And thank God in all his glory for that…*

“What? That’s not how things were before!”

“I understand that’s not how things were before, but if you could tell me exactly what you are trying to do, then perhaps I can help you or tell you what you need to order.”

“I just need to do my job, exactly how I did *three days ago*! You say the procedures are new – were they set in place the day before yesterday??”

*She explains – very poorly – what she is trying to accomplish on WebEnvironment, and after a while (and after actually conferring with a senior desk-buddy about it), I realize that she doesn’t actually need admin permissions. All she needs is a standard account – which she has. What the message is about might just be some dumb bug or, let’s say, a mistake-riddled mis-click on her part…*

“Ma’am, can you do something for me? Could you click ‘Back’ for a second and tell me what the window says?”

“Why? What’s that gonna help?”

*She does do it, however.*

“It says to login as me, with all my stuff in already, or with another account.”

“Click the ‘other account’ one and then put in your own credentials, like you normally do.”

*She grunts angrily.*

“Now it says the username or password is wrong! That’s because I picked the other account – it knows it’s not me!”

*I mute and almost choke on my chuckle.*

“No, Ma’am, it only means your password has expired or been typed in wrong too many times in a row.”

“Hey – it’s expired in that case! I didn’t do anything, it’s not my fault your passwords expire!”

“Well, you should change it!”

“We should… *change* our country code..?”

“Yes! How’s one supposed to realize it’s IT calling when it could be just anyone with a crazy number – maybe you’re calling to scam me or something!”

*I mute to slap myself in the face. Hard. She keeps going.*

“You’re in IT, aren’t you? One would think there’d be a way for you to change what the number looks like, to let us know who’s calling, so that we know to answer! I never answer with outlandish numbers!”

*This conversation escalated quickly…*

“Um, I’m sorry that we scared you, Ma’am, but, most people *do* see that it’s a number from practically next door…”

“Oh, do they, now..? How would you know? Does everyone answer when you call back every time??”

“Um…”

“See, we’ve been warned about answering when strange numbers call us!”

”It works? And how does it look inside of WebEnvironment?”

“There’s still something wrong here! It doesn’t look like it usually looks!”

“All right, fine. Do I have to do something?”

“Now, while this is starting up, could you tell me what’s wrong, so that I know what to look for?”

“What do you mean? It just doesn’t look like it did before, you guys must have messed with it, or my computer is broken some way.”

“What I mean is, WebEnvironment is a huge environment and it doesn’t look exactly the same for everyone, even under [BigCompany that owns her DaughterCompany]. You have different apps, you organize files differently and so on…”

“Ah, yes – that’s one of the problems! I can’t find anything! And even the *logo* looks weird! Like the pixels are wrong!”

*Ah, great – someone’s learned the word ‘pixels’! Now, if she only could learn what it means and how it works… And then, I realize, I think I know what the problem is, and I cross all my fingers and toes in a prayer that I’m right.*

*We get in. I actually raise my face towards the ceiling and thank God.*

*I’m right!*

*I un-mute, and I clear my throat.*

“What e-mail? What update?”

“Just this superficial update – to the logo, for instance – and for where the shared folders are and whatnot – still right here!”

*I take over her mouse and I click on her shared folders, that have been moved from a little arrow on the left, to a little arrow on the right.*

“Are you sure that’s it?”

“Positive, Ma’am. This is the way it’s supposed to look now.”

“Really…? All right… I liked it better the old way, it was much easier to see! But okay, okay, then it was as I said – it wasn’t something *I* did!”

*I shake my head once more.*

“That’s all good, Ma’am – I can officially confirm that you did in fact not update WebEnvironment during the weekend… If that’s all..?”

“That’s all. Good.”

”Do I have your permission to close my case, Ma’am?”

“I guess so.”

258,First post! User deletes files they desperately need.,"So this happened last week and I'm an IT Tech. 

I was working with my co-worker installing a rack-mounted NAS on a Friday, about an hour and a half before closing time. Out of nowhere the PR Generalist comes bursting in to the server room saying how there was some kind of video the old PR Manager was supposed to do for an outside company, but he quit before the project was completed, and the company has already paid my company and are now threatening to cut off all business ties unless they get this video. So I need to set up a workstation for our former manager so he can work on it next week. 

Well, the former manager comes in that next week and claims he can't find any of the files on his old computer. In a panic, the PR Generalist comes into my office, so I show her how to search a computer for any specific file types, as well as created a shortcut on her desktop to all of the PR Managers old files (she is using his old computer). Apparently that wasn't enough because a couple hours later the Generalist comes back to my office because she still can't find these files. I begrudgingly go to her workstation and within 10 minutes I have the files located. The Generalist, almost in tears, thanks me profusely and I firmly place myself on the ""saves the day"" pedestal and sigh thinking I can put this dumb situation behind me and concentrate on my actual job duties. 

The next day, again, the Generalist comes into my office in a panic because she was going through the Managers old files and was ""cleaning out some of his old files"" and informed me that she deleted the files they were looking for. Being Windows (10 at that), the files were too big so they were permanently deleted. I tried running Recuva and nothing was able to be successfully restored.

As a result, the school relied on a few tech-savvy teachers and students (like myself) to help out with computer issues.

BACKSTORY: There was a student who was vision impaired so he had a laptop with special software designed to read things out to him. He would attend some of the regular classes but would often have special one-on-one classes in one of the computer labs.  

THE ACTUAL STORY: I was in class one day and the teacher gets a call from the computer teacher (by that I mean the teacher that taught how to use Microsoft Word and Excel, and was by no means a computer tech.) in the CTS lab asking if I can come down and help them as this student's laptop  had shut off while he was using it and wouldn't turn back on.

262,The Desk Lamp Case,"Hello TFTS,

A little story today, not really an amazing one, but I thought it could still be worth sharing.

So to give a little bit of context, we are in an open space environment here, with electric desks (you know, those desks with an adjustable height), and we have two electric plugs on the upper left corner of the desk, and on each electric plug, there is also two USB ports. So basically, users have more than enough space to plug their laptops, and eventually their mobile phone charger.

Now, for the story in itself, anything related to electric equipments or furniture in general are not handled by IT but by a building manager, who is also in charge of assigning lockers, creating access cards, etc...

Since she recently arrived here, she isn't too familiar with some equipments and after hearing complaints about an electric plug that wasn't working on a desk in the second floor, she asked us if we could take a look at it. Our manager agreed and I went to check on the desk, I plugged my phone and its charger on the first plug, and it worked. Then on the second plug... it didn't.

I raised the desk, and opened up the case below the desk, where all the wires are passing through to, then, reach the ground. And one of the electric plug was indeed disconnected.

Since I also found a little desk lamp beside of the desk, I suppose that a user wanted to plug it but not on his desk, or maybe was he already using the two plugs, so he raised the desk, opened the case, randomly disconnected a wire and plugged his desk lamp. He then disconnected it too... without reconnecting the previous plug. And as we're in flexwork, there is no way to know who did that, unfortunately. I don't even know why they would need a desk lamp, as we're currently in summer here, so we have long days with sunlight, the desk isn't located in some dark corner of the building, it's actually right next to a window, and all the lights on the ceiling are working...

263,New printer is broken,"Having escaped a hellish IT environment, I might as well share some tales from my times there. 

A year ago, my boss announced that a few heavy use printers were getting replaced with newer models that could handle the load. There was nothing wrong with the printers, but seeing as the decision was above my pay grade, I went along with the plan. 

Within a few days, there were 3 printers delivered. 2 hefty MFPs, and 1 laser printer. The replacements are set in place and the 2 older MFPs are wheeled out. My boss requested that the old laser printer be kept aside in case someone needs a replacement. I inform my co-worker since my shift ended 30 minutes ago and rush to class. 

The next morning I get a phone call: 

* **$Me - Part time worker who is chasing the ""non-existent"" full time position people keep mentioning**
* **$User- end user from unliked department**
* **$Boss - Barks orders and approves time sheet. Can never be found when needed.** 
* **$Coworker - Basically full time version of my position but acts more like my boss than my actual boss**
* **$User2- Similar position as $User, but can/will be meaner**
* **$BigBoss - Boss's boss, lets boss get away with things since they are not comfortable with tech.** 
* **$PM- No filter, cool person**

&gt;**$Me - IT**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$User- The new printer isn't printing correctly. Its crooked and must be on some drugs cause its printing different colors.** 

Looks at clock and it just hit 8AM aka I sense a long day ahead

I skip the phone support and walk over to the department where I am faced with a printer who just puked toner on paper and called it a print job. Its still early and my brain isn't in troubleshooting mode yet, so I phone my coworker to get an update. 

&gt;**$Me - Yo $Coworker, was the new printer in department X working yesterday?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Coworker - Yeah, why?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - Its puking toner on paper**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Coworker - wut????**

*Sends him picture of print jobs*

&gt;**$Coworker - Oh that, it did that yesterday as well. I just left the toner door open and let it dry out some.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - ...... uhh**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Coworker - Try that out and if it doesn't work call support.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - Ok, what about crooked prints?**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$Coworker - I didn't see anything yesterday, try and fix it**

*end call*

As per instructions, I document the instructions and proceed to follow them. I inform $End of the scenario and connect them to another printer. All is well.......for the next 15 minutes. 

*phone rings*

&gt;**$Me - I...**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$User2- Why isn't the printer working?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - $End put in a request since it was not working properly. I am implementing a solution and am coming over to check it out. In the mean time, do you need to print something out asap?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$User2- NO! I will get $User to print it out for me**

*phone slams down*

The time is now 8:25AM

I stroll over, close the toner door and proceed to print roughly 20 pages (4 separate jobs) and all are clean. Also notice that the alignment is on point, but just to play it safe I ask $User to print out the print job with the alignment issue. They do, and the alignment is still off. I play with the settings, but cannot get it perfectly without...

1. Messing up the alignment of other items in that specific print job
2. Messing up other print jobs
3. An influx of phone calls (BTW we have a ticketing system, but no one uses it)

Its 8:45AM so i decide to put in a request to the printer tech support. The request is made and I ask for an ETA......I get nothing from them, so I let $Boss know and he gets it escalated. The technician comes in a few hours later and I spend another 1.5 hours trying to get this to work with the tech, but get nowhere. He gets frustrated, sets things back to default and heads out as he has another call to take. $User and $User2 send a lengthy email to $Coworker, $Boss and $BigBoss and attempt to use me to back up their claims. I speak with $Coworker about the matter and he advises that we talk to $Boss about it. 

$Boss makes a few phone calls and gets a few engineers from printer company to come take a look at the machine. They deem it defective, but do not take it back since it was ordered via 3rd party. $User2 requests old printer back....and that's where things get interesting. 

&gt;**$Boss - Guys where is the old printer**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - I don't know. I relayed your message to $Coworker and left for class.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$Coworker - The company took it away for recycling, I'll call them and request it back.** 

*An hour later*

&gt;**$Coworker - They can't find the printer. They have no record of taking it back.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$Boss - Let me make some calls.** 

As he makes his calls, $BigBoss catches me near the break room

&gt;**$BigBoss - I saw the email from $User2, you know we are suppose to provide quality service to the company.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - That was an outside technician who we use whenever we have severe printer issues**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$BigBoss - But how does that make IT look??**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - We are working on it and will resolve it in a timely manner.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$BigBoss - Is $Coworker in? Maybe he should handle this?** 

I am fully capable of doing the tasks assigned to me, but $BigBoss loves to undermine my skills whenever she can. 

&gt;**$Me - I'll go check (aka im walking away now)**

3 days later, the printer magically appears and is in place at that department. They are happy, $BigBoss is off my back and I proceed to close out the ticket. That defective printer ends up sitting in our storage and $Boss does nothing to return it. It sits there for roughly 9 months before this happens....

&gt;**$PM- Hey $Me, do y'all have a spare printer? I hate having to go to the big printer down the hall.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - There is one, but its got an alignment issue.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**$PM - How bad is it?** 

I fetch the printer, hook it up and they run a few test prints to it. Issue is not a factor since what they print aligns perfectly. 

&gt;**$Me - How the??**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$PM - I see no issue here...**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - But me and $Coworker saw this have an issue**

Attention turned to $Coworker

&gt;**$PM - Does this printer have an alignment issues?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Coworker - Not that i'm aware of**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - Don't you remember that saga from earlier**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Coworker - No...**

*\*sigh\**

As PM enjoys her new printer, $Coworker pulls me aside. 

&gt;**$Coworker - Why did you tell them about that printer?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me - Department needed a printer, we had a printer with an issue, they saw that it was non-issue and accepted the printer. Printer is no longer sitting collecting dust, mission accomplished.**

264,"Nepotism runs wild, breeds stupidity","Preamble: Not technically a tech support job but I am the informal tech support for the night cable team at a datacenter. I was put on a project with someone who is very technologically inept and just generally not all that bright. He fairly routinely needed help with his laptop. Honestly the only reason he still has a job is nepotism.

Copypasta: There are several ways to copy and paste. If you use computers you generally find one you like and keep using it. The person I got stuck with apparently knew none, despite him being about 35-45. If somehow you make it through many years of life with computers without having to learn something like that I would simply teach you. I showed him two ways actually. Then a day or two later I showed him again... then again... then someone else had to teach him a few times, and then a few more people tried.... After I think about a dozen attempts across 5 different people he \*may\* have finally remembered how to copy and paste. 

Server or local copy: Part of our job includes editing a spreadsheet stored on a sharepoint site. Not terribly difficult. The excel web app has most of the features needed and is required for multiple people to edit the same spreadsheet at the same time. Unless you cache a copy and open it in excel. The problem with doing that is when you tell it to save back to the server, if someone else has made a change it doesn't know how to merge them. Usually not a big deal, the easiest way to avoid it without having to use the web app is to make sure nobody else is working on it and save your changes before you leave. Well my coworker failed to save, left for the night with the spreadsheet still open. As would happen someone during the day changed the spreadsheet. Coworker comes in the next day and is unable to save (to his credit he actually read the error message, though was unable to comprehend it). The computer is prompting him to keep server copy or keep local copy, To me the obvious solution is keep server and just reenter the small amount of data from the day before. I tell him this and explain that it will erase the progress he made so he will have to enter it again. A few minutes later he is once again complaining... because he cant find any of the information he entered the day before. I reiterate that what I told him to do erased it and he will have to re enter it. His reasoning? 'well i didn't believe you, I thought you were just kidding around'.

268,Users with OCD,"I'm an IT manager at a company that's acquired 6 other companies in the past year, and I support about 50 remote users, most of which I know well from when they worked at the physical office I'm still at.  A couple of the users have OCD as it relates to work - their inbox needs to be completely empty at the end of the day, their desktop cannot have any icons that are absolutely necessary, their windows settings must be tweaked exactly to their liking, etc.   Since I'm friendly with them I don't mind helping, even if it's just doing crap they could do by googling.

One of these OCD users had been having issues with Citrix Reciever that we could not solve, so we decided to nuke Windows over the weekend and start over.  So of course today after the weekend there was a ton of personalized settings to fix. I spent 90 minutes and helped fix most of it (Outlook sending notifications to the Action Center, for instance).   Then the user asks if we can make the default font (Calibri Bold 11) bigger in Outlook. I said ""Sure, is it too small?""  She replies back ""No, I just can't stand having it be an odd number so I want to be 12"".

We buy desktops and laptops on a four-year rotation, for about $800 a pop (yeah, I know, we're cheap).

They have a clean install of Windows 10 and nothing else, and we make clear that they are offered with no warranty or support whatsoever and could last 5 years or could die in 30 days.  Nevertheless, we get a few takers because they're a lot better than what you can normally pick up for that price.

271,Tales of Admin-Bunny,"Disclaimer: I'm one of those people that you people describe with ""Knows just enough to be dangerous"" so I'm sorry for any confusion.  


Actors:  
$Me = Me  
$PO= PC-Owner  
$AB= Admin-Bunny, while not a nickname that stuck, you'll see why I chose it, he's my best friend...and the unlucky soul I call when I run into problems.  


Tale One:A young friend of mine had trouble with her PC.  
As I was sitting around at her place anyway, I offered to take a look.She told me it was slow as hell and refused to play music, so I started the machine.  
Immediately I learned what she meant with ""slow"". It took a solid 15minutes to boot.  
In the meantime I learned that some well meaning friend hat frankensteined the thing out of parts that, at least some of them, might be older than the girl.  
It had floppy-disk-drive for hells sake! So, after spending some time allowing Win10 to update I tried to figure out the sound issue.  
Windows helpfully pointed out that there was no Audio Hardware, which seemed fishy, as the machine had played music before Win10 came along.  
Off I go to find some drivers. Automatic updates insist there isn't anything to update, and I can't find anything that looks sound related in the hardware that has a model number or makers name.  
Frustrated I write to $AB about the issue.  
He calls back in minutes and requests remote access.  


$Po is currently not in the room, so knows neither of the call, nor the remote access.  
$PO comes in, sees her PC click and scroll through various menus while my hands are off of everything.  


$PO ""Uhhh, what is it doing?"" To her credit, she didn't sound overly concerned.  
I turn around, look her in the eyes with as serious face as I can manage and tell her ""Your PC seems to be posessed, please get some holy water.""  


About this time $AB the PC-Demon opens up a youtube tab I had left open and types ""Does it work now?"" thoroughly ruining my mediocre acting, so I had to explain the remote access.  


I try and type ""Nope, give me a moment"" and slide under the desk to try and fiddle with the audio ports.  


$PO ""You did turn up the volume, right?""  
$Me ""Uhhh, sure?""She turns up the volume from zero and we get sound.  


$AB saves the day and gets a thank-you note.  
(and yes, for previous tests I had turned on the speakers, it was a driver problem)  


Tale 2: AB-Origins  


$AB at the time is a design student who also doubles as tech support for the department at his University.  


He calls me and is rather annoyed about his fellow students.  
To make it short: They had a Mac that wouldn't start, despite the hardware being okay.   
Annoyingly, this Mac was the one all students in his design department would use to present their work on various projects. This, as the ever competent AB found out, was also the problem, as dozens of students a day would just drag and drop rather big presentations on the desktop, which Macs notoriously dislike.  


So he went through the whole process of wiping all drives and setting up this mac again.  
Then he spent some time obsessing over fonts and made a tastefull desktop-Background that explained why dropping things on the desktop was bad.  
Not even 24hours later, the desktop was so full of stuff you could barely see his warning. I told him ""Give me a minute"" pulled a meme template of the time from the internet, fought with the urge to use comic-sans for a moment and finally send him an image with instructions to put it as the new desktop background.  


The image was of a fluffy white rabbit, covering his face with his little paws and the text:""If you save to the desktop, you make Admin-Bunny cry!""  


I'm proud to report that this not only solved the issue, the image became the standart background for the macs of the department and the logo for the department-Facebook-group.

273,A rock and a hard place...,"I love this sub and have been getting a kick out of some amazing/fun/shocking/brain numbing dumb stories haha. So thank you all for sharing your experiences! I've even learned a thing or 2 from a couple.

This next one of mine comes from my days of my IT Traineeship. I was 20 and the $company that hired me was a small training outfit for tradesman. I was hired by the $HIT as his sidekick to support the students and staff. He trained me up over a few years but truthfully I have self taught myself more with the ancient style of Google-Fu.

Like most companies of that size with a heavy ""tradesman culture"" the IT guys are only seen as 2 things. Dark Wizards... or useless nerds getting away with doing nothing because ""nothing ever breaks"" and we are only do basic ""on/off support"". Obviously untrue as they never see or understood the setup behind the scenes.

Anyway, the Owner of this place known as $CreepoOwner was a piece of work. Slimy, yet friendly. Happy yet screaming in your face. It was unsettling trying to figure out his mood any given day so you could navigate yourself out of the firing line. The relationship between $HIT and $CreepoOwner was always strained. $CreepoOwner didn't like $HIT or $Me but he knew he needed us. He would always pull us up on stupid things that i wont go into but it caused $HIT to be very secretive with the infrastructure. Its understandable why, due to the HUGE turnover rate. He protected our knowledge so we were un-fireable. That only lasted so long but that's another story. One of the main things $HIT hid was the Admin passwords to the VMs/servers/firewalls etc etc. 

As the underling I would always be put in the middle between both the $CreepoOwner's and $HIT's authority. I was not allowed under any circumstances to share the Admin passwords with $CreepoOwner on pain of unemployment. Also not complying with $CreepoOwner ' requests had a similar outcome with more yelling. It was a recipe for disaster that was incredibly unfair on me but whatever. 

Sorry for the massive setup, but I like to give context and a setting.

One summer evening after work...

Me = $Me

Head of IT (my boss) = $HIT

CreepoOwner = $Owner

$Owner \[Calls my Personal Mobile Afterhours\]: $Me, whats the Admin password to my F\*\*\*ing laptop.

$Me: uhhhh hi $Owner, whats the problem with your normal login?

$Owner: One of you idiots locked me out! Now get me back in right now!

$Me: Sorry, we wouldnt have done that but i'll see if i can get your account working again.

$Owner: No give me the Admin login now!

(all company devices have an Admin login for us to access to change things. We gave limited acces to everyone due to many issues in the past)

$Me: ummm sorry, but I'm not allowed to give you that password.

(all hell breaks loose)

$Owner: ARE YOU F\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\* SERIOUS???!?!? I AM THE F\*\*\*\* OWNER OF THIS F\*\*\*\*\* BUSINESS. GIVE ME THAT F\*\*\*\* PASSWORD RIGHT F\*\*\*\*\*\* NOW OR YOU ARE DONE. YOU HEAR ME?!!

(he is completely right but 1. yelling 2. I hate that $HIT put me in this situation)

$Me: \*Internally\* oh f\*\*\*... what do I do I really need to finish the traineeship for the qualifications. Shit shit shit....... BRAINWAVE!

$Me: Ok, sorry sir. The Admin password for that laptop should be \*PASSword123\* 

(it was actually \*passWORD123\*)

$Owner: That didnt work!

$Me: Aw damn, looks like its fully locked down. Would you like me to come round and take a look?

$Owner: Get it done. \*Hangs up\*

Now I would never do that these days unless there was OT involved but I was young and desperate to keep the higher-ups happy. I drove over to his house and jumped on the laptop to be a tech wizard and ""unlock"" the laptop. I then created a new ""admin"" account which gave him no additional access. $Owner was happy that he got the password out of us and my $HIT was happy that I didn't give him the real one... man that was stressful.

274,“\” is not the same as “/“,"This didn’t happen recently but probably more than 10 years ago.  I work for one of Canada’s major banks and was supporting an application that provides corporate clients an official report on their holding with the bank on any given date.   The app at that time was written in VB and connected to various databases which were MS Access.  A database was getting quite full so i had archived it and created a new one over the weekend. The way the app worked is that the users would have to edit a configuration and provide the full path to the database for the given date range.  Easy stuff, right?

Monday morning rolls around and everything is smooth until one user calls up and tells me the app is throwing an error saying database does not exist.  I asked if she followed my instructions on how to edit the config and she assured me that she followed it step by step and that she still can’t get it work.   She’s getting frustrated and deep down so am I.  I walk through the same steps and get her to read me out the database path that she entered and it seemed fine. I again get her to repeat it, again she’s telling me the right thing.

She’s going on and on that I don’t know what I’m doing and that I am wasting her valuable time and that my problem should be escalated.   I calmly say, hey do you have a piece of paper?

275,"""Hang on a mo..."" (or, ""please don't do that again"")","Just remembered this one. Pretty minor, all things considered, but amusing.

Over the last couple of months, I've been upgrading our desktops from spinning-disks to SSDs. I've gradually refined my process and can get a machine reliably copied in an evening (it's not a simple case of just DD'ing the partition since the SSDs are smaller (512GB vs 1TB), consistent with the machines we've bought with SSDs as standard, since we don't store masses of data locally).

A colleague messages me saying his machine (with a spinning disk) is giving him a warning about the boot partition being full - Ubuntu has the annoying habit of creating very small `/boot` partitions so this happens quite a lot. Sometimes a simple `apt-get autoremove` is enough so long as there's a little bit of available space, but other times, APT does its best to plough through and use every last byte. This was one of those occasions.

So I SSH into the machine and begin clearing sufficient space on `/boot` by hand, then nuking the old kernels. Meanwhile I'm chatting with $colleague on Slack as I work.

&gt;$me: okay, so I've cleared space, now I'm gonna work through the pending updates.  
&gt;$colleague: great. while you're at it, my machine is *really* slow when I first fire it up. I mean, I can go get a coffee and it won't have loaded up CLion.  
&gt;$me: ah, that's kinda expected, CLion has tonnes of tiny little files it touches when it starts. Probably the disk holding you back.  
&gt;$me: &lt;begin typing a sentence about putting him on the list for an SSD upgrade&gt;  
&gt;$colleague: hang on a mo  

I blink. He drops off Slack.

I switch back to my terminal. My SSH session has died. I look at the last thing it got to.

`Generating initramfs for &lt;current kernel&gt;...`

Oh.

I wander over to him, and sure enough, he's rebooted his machine. And it's dropped to an initramfs shell.

&gt;$colleague: umm... what happened??  
&gt;$me: &lt;with great patience&gt; what did you reboot for?  
&gt;$colleague: that always made my last machine run faster...  
&gt;$me: &lt;explain that he's interrupted the initramfs generation and essentially nuked his current kernel until I rebuild it&gt;  
&gt;$colleague: uh, so it's not like Windows then?  
&gt;$me: indeed. so I was going to suggest putting you on the list for an SSD, but now I think it's going to be faster to give you one of the already-upgraded spares. Well done forcing my hand, sir...  

Exactly what I did - pulled my spare freshly imaged SSD-powered desktop out of the cupboard, set it up on his desk, get him logged in, PXE-boot his machine and `rsync` his files off the HDD onto the new SSD. He gets his upgrade, I put in an order for another spare SSD.

I don't hold it against him, after all he did have *extremely* good timing for triggering the reboot - a few seconds either side and the initramfs would be fine. Despite me clearly telling him I was logged in and working on his machine, he decided spur-of-the-moment to reboot with a quite ambiguous warning.

And yes, I know I could have rebooted him into a previous kernel, but I decided to etch in the need to be more careful about doing stuff with Linux - that it will do *exactly* what you tell it to do, so please be extremely careful what the instruction is!

277,The Day I Encountered a Classically-Trained $User,"I work for a small MSP as the guy in charge of centralized services (basically if more than one of our clients is managed from a central dashboard, it's in my jurisdiction -- this includes backups, managed AV, monitoring, etc...). When backups are humming along, virus threats from users are at a lull, and the server fires are at a controlled burn, I will pick up some slack and work service desk tickets. I was not prepared for this particular ticket.  

The one I picked up this day was internal: $User accidentally deleted some emails she needs back. This is typically not an issue, as all but a very few of our clients use Orifice 365 and have their mail backed up using the SaaS backup service offered by one of our partners. 

Since it's in-house and I could use the exercise, I walk across the building and find $User sitting at her desk, in the middle of a call. She sees me and holds up a finger to let me know she's almost done. She finishes the call and looks at me.  

**$User**: Hey, $Zeihous.  
**$Me**: Hey. So, you've got some email you deleted and need to recover. What folder were they in?  
**$User**: Uh... they were in the Deleted Items folder. 

**$Me**: ...

*No, this can't be,* I thought.

**$User**: What?  

**$Me**: So, the emails were in the deleted items folder and you deleted them again? You deleted these emails *twice* on accident?  

**$User**: Well, I didn't delete them twice. I kept them in the Deleted Items folder so I could look at them later. 

**$Me**: You kept your important emails in the email trash can so you could look at them later?

**$User**: ...it sounds kinda stupid when you say it out loud. 

**$Me**: Create a folder in your inbox for them and keep them there in the future. 


I gathered information I needed from $User to find the emails we're looking for. I load up the backups from right before she deleted the emails and find several hundred emails that exactly match, but, because the only terms I had to search brought up several thousand other emails as well, I couldn't simply restore the entire search, as that would make it difficult to sort through and I'd end up with even *more* work to do. So, I just restore the entire mailbox to the inbox under a folder labeled ""Restore from:"" and the date and let her sort through it. I emailed her to let her know that the restore will take a little time, but if she doesn't have it by tomorrow morning to give me a call back. 

The next morning I get a call from $User. 

**$User**: The folder isn't there. 

*I know I told it to restore. It surely can't take* this *long*

**$Me**: Okay, I'll be over in a minute. 

I walked back across the building and ask her to show me what she's seeing. She indicates the Inbox folder. 

**$User**: See? It isn't there.

**$Me**: Expand the Inbox folder. 

**$User**: What?

**$Me**: See the little triangle beside 'Inbox?' Click that. 

**$User** clicks the triangle and a folder labeled ""Restore *date*"" pops up. 

**$User**: Oh! There it is. Okay, let's see...

She clicks on the folder. Nothing pops up in the message pane. 

**$User**: There's nothing here. 

**$Me**: Expand the folder. 

**$User**: What? 

**$Me**: Click the little triangle. 

**$User**: Oh, yeah.

She expands the folder and sees a bunch of other folders that were in the restore. She clicks on Inbox. 

**$User**: They're not here. 

**$Me**: Where did you keep them?

**$User**: Oh! 

She clicks the Deleted Items folder and finds the messages she's looking for. I tell her that she'll need to go through and find them and move them to another folder. Once she's found everything she needs, she can delete the folders named ""Restore."" She thanks me and I go back to my desk and the comforting, forehead-shaped indentation. 

However, the next day, I come back from lunch to a voicemail from $User. 

**$User**: Hey, $Zeihous. The folder is gone. It isn't there anymore. Can you come take a look? 

I go back to her desk and find that she has once again forgotten how to expand the folders. We have a little tutorial again and she is satisfied that she has her emails back.

278,Never Trust The Guy That's Leaving,"Another story to go along with my [tale of the broken installation](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8m94wc/its_installed_where/).

The big difference with this tale is that I take an awful lot of the blame for what went wrong.

My own stupidity and not making time for the simple stuff left us pretty far up the creek without a paddle in sight. But please do remember, before you judge me too much, that as skilled as I am, I was simply used as a firefighter whenever those above me screwed the pooch. I had little knowledge of the infrastructure as that information was kept from me.

Some backstory...

&gt;As the IT Manager (**$ITM**) in my previous story was heading out the door to retire off on the south coast, his handover procedure was, shall we say, a little hamfisted. The main thing affected for the purposes of this story, is backups.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because it's always the bloody backups.  
&gt;  
&gt;For a couple of years, I (**$TR**) had complained that as what was essentially a ""keep the gears running"" team, we needed e-mail alerts for everything. Backups, Hyper-V clusters, anything. I wanted something to tell me if there was an issue so I could get into it quickly and try and rescue it before it affected the couple of thousand people I worked for.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alas, my cries fell on deaf ears and the information hogging $ITM simply read all the alert emails and told us what to fix. It made things a load of fun when he was on leave.

Anyways.

Upon handing his notice in, he started to edit these email settings so they mailed me directly.  I very quickly set up a Distribution List for such things and asked him to send them there.

*MISTAKE 1 - I definitely should have done this myself. Why, will become apparent pretty soon.*

**$ITM** ""It'll mail you anytime it has an error or fails a backup""

**$TR** ""Not for successful backups?""

**$ITM** ""No, there's too many jobs and it'll spam you and you'll just ignore them.""

*MISTAKE 2 - I know, I can hear you all screaming at me. I should have gone and changed that.*

Let's assume now that everything was running smoothly and I wasn't fighting a constant slew of dumpster fires on a daily basis just to keep things running for the 4 weeks between $ITM leaving and where our story starts.

A 6th form student (**$ST**) rushed into the room - on a friday afternoon of all the times he could - and kick starts just a shower of awfulness.

**$ST** Mr TR, I have lost my work!

*I've dealt with this particular student before. He's a decent kid and hasn't been one to BS me in the years I've been there so I forego the usual crap and we jump straight into it.*

I log on to the backup server and start the process of running a restore.

Except, there's no backups for the last five weeks.

None.

Zilch. Zero.

S\*\*\*!

Right, there has to be an explanation, lets have a look.

\*\*$TR ""\*\*The server's being a pain in the ass. scribble down the file name and I'll recover it for you once I've slapped it about a bit.""

It doesn't take long for me to realise that the problem is that the backups have been failing, daily, for a full month!

S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*!

Not just the student data server. Finacial data, database servers that include information we are legally obliged to hold onto for years and ensure we have backups of. We are in a right mess.

I am in a right mess.

I could honestly see my job going out the window at this point.

I dig.

I read through logs of jobs that I should have had mailed to me and discover that the repository has completely run out of space. I dig a little deeper and it appears that it has been doing this for months and $ITM has ""*cured""* it by either manually deleting old backups or extending the datastore it's using as a repository.

Oh crap!

The datastore...

My worst fears come to life when i see that no only has the volume for the Backup Repo filled to capacity. every other volume is throwing alerts for low space and everything is over-provisioned.

S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*!

Surely I should have gotten emails about this, too?

Now I'm in a rabbit-hole of errors I need to find and I'm yet to recover this poor kid's work.

At this point, it's time to fess up and go see someone and tell them about the prolem(s) before someone else does.

&gt;*I'd honestly never held my head in true shame until this day. When I walked into the Business Director's office to explain myself.*

Meetings with financial directors and head teachers and department leads soon follow and I have to explain over and over again the issues and stand there and say I have no idea why I didn't know they were happening. The first of my three prepared envelopes doesn't feel like an appropriate excuse for a f\*\*\* up this monumental.

The thing about this story is, there was no magical fix that brought everything back to life. It was a near impossible situation.

I sat with the student and recovered what I could from the locally stored files on the last computer he was logged in to (thank god the profile wipe on logout wasn't working) and instead of losing weeks of work he only lost a couple of hours.

I had a little bit of goodwill left over from $ITM retiring and me keeping things going and I managed to keep my job. But not without being hauled up in front of a committee of governors and having to explain why i wanted to spend tens of thousands on a new backup system with a separate repository. As well as a few grand on increasing RAM on all of our hyper-visors that were running an entire academy's worth of servers on barely enough memory to keep the place functioning.

It was an absolute nightmare few weeks that ended with a checklist being created for whoever was in first everymorning to go through to make surethings were still standing. and to warn us of any incoming issues.

And the problem with the emails?

Wanna take a guess?

$ITM can't spell.

This might not be the biggest event in human history, but that I actually got to see what happened to these dudes after we hung up really made my day! So, without further ado, let me present the conclusion in: 

**I'm Basically The Manager pt 2: - I'm Actually The Manager!**


""Welcome to IT Service Desk! You're speaking to UnintentionalAss, how can I help you?""

*The man from The Dark Abyss of Ignorance sounds very tired, like he just woke up. I almost picture him sitting in his underwear, barely awake, in gloomy dim, light, perhaps a wee bit hung over.*

""Yes, hello. I'm calling about an issue regarding [company + location that seem very familiar], and I have a ticket number here, and, erh... Do you want my user-ID..?""

*He gives me his User-ID, and he starts reading me the ticket number - but I recognize this account, and I know exactly which ticket he's referring to. I have it pasted in my notes, just in case I'd get this call - and by the hand of God, I am handed the resolution to the problem for the poor man who was basically the manager, and Gary, the Password-Pusher!*

""Yes, Sir, I have the ticket right here! And you need a password reset, right?""

*He makes some low grunt of confusion.*

""That's right...""

""And just to confirm, you are Mr. Manager and you are actually the manager on this site?"" 

""Yes, of course I'm *actually* the manager."" 

""I'll need a number I can reach you on, Sir.""

""Yeah, um, I'm on vacation - can I give you my private number? Is that all right?""

""Yes, no worries, Sir, that'll be grand!""

*He gives me his number and hangs up, so that I can do my thing. I unlock the account with a smile on my face, picturing BasicallyTheManager taking a liberating breath, lost in The Abyss no more. I call Mr. Manager back.*

""Hello, IT Service here! Thanks for waiting! Are you ready for your new password, Sir?""

""Shoot.""

""[Bravo, Oscar, Lima, Lima, Oscar, X-ray, Zero, Five]""

*Middle-aged and old men love the phonetic alphabet.*

""That's it? All right, thank you.""

""No problem, Sir! And hey - make sure Gary doesn't get his hands on it this time!""

*He chuckles loudly and snorts.*

""What?""

""Never mind, Sir... A serious piece of advice, though - perhaps you should consider ordering some permissions for your employees, so that this issue with your account is not repeated any time soon.""

*He gets quiet for a bit, seems a little stumped, and to my surprise and delight, I meet with no resistance.*

""Um, all right..."" 

""Cheers! Have a nice vacation now!""

""Yeah, thanks! Bye.""

*He hangs up, and I lean back in my chair. Feels good being me sometimes. Actually feels good.*

280,Just Following the process,"Couldn't find the Tales from Product Managers page but this might fit here. I currently work at a start-up that had been founder led for the last 3 years and recently brought on a product owner (PO) to get the dev guys in line and organize the sprints around priorities. Us Professional Services teams had been sending any new features to the exec team and having them decide what was important but now we were to have 'process'.

The plan the PO put in place was actually really good and outlined the process well; since it is only the first two steps that matter here they were:

1. Get requirements, build out functional request
2. Open Jira and send to Architecture
3. etc

Since I have been here 1 year I had a queue of over 20 of Features that I thought would be good in the future but didn't have any customer leverage or were internal and needed more discussions with the devs on how we could accomplish. I had created Jiras, and assigned to myself as to be put in my queue for easy access for when they were ready.

D = PS Director

PO = Product Owner

Me

D: ""PO is saying your not following his new process, he found a bunch of Jiras with just links""

Me: ""Those are just supposed to be internal and are for reference until I have all the requirements and can move to step 2""

I thought that was good enough until about a week later I got a Slack from PO, very angry now.

PO: ""How can you have a 6 month feature request open and not be following the process, if these need to be looked at they should be done and moved to step 2""

Me: ""They are not ready, just ideas.""

PO: ""They can't move to Architecture in this shape, they are just one line, not even a story""

Me: ""Yes, I know I have not even gotten to step 1 in your new plan""

PO: ""But they are still in your name, Architecture won't even be able to see them""

Me: ""Correct, they are not ready, that's why they are in my name. When I am done with requirements I'll move to Architecture""

PO: ""This might be escalated""

Later the PS Director came over to explain that he was just concerned with 'aging Jira' tickets, so I guess now there will be some adjustments for a pre-step 1, if you have ideas just keep them in a notebook.",False,107,8,Poortio,talesfromtechsupport

282,Mercury's position should not effect your backup procedures,"After seeing a post about mercury starting to go into retrograde it reminded me of a story.  


Some years back I used to work at a company that supported a few dozen small/medium law firms.  One of the daily tasks we had was to verify backups ran just fine the night before and make sure the next tape was in for that evening's run.  One particular small client has this strange woman working there as a paralegal that was in charge of swapping the tape.  She was one of those people that was into all that new age nonsense, crystals, astrology and the whole nine yards.  When I first started working there I kept chasing and chasing her to put in tapes with no response.  Finally I voiced my concerns to a coworker she told me that the woman only put in the tapes when mercury was in retrograde because it effects technology.  WTF?  So as you can imagine that eventually was a major issue for them.  They lost a bunch of data and the last tape they had to go back to was months old.  I think they had paper copies of a lot of the documents but every time they needed to do a quick edit on the document they were sitting there hand typing the document over so they can revise it with a few quick edits.  This was before good OCR software was out there so it ended up being quicker to retype than to scan, OCR and fix the messed up scanned document.  ",False,597,106,BeerJunky,talesfromtechsupport
283,You know what they say about eyesight and computers.,"I'll preface this by saying my family and extended family's eyesight is *bad*. Ranging from literally all my uncles and aunts having reading glasses, to two cousins with colorblindness, to another who already has macular degeneration before they're 24.

So I'm clearing up tickets that got lost in the tsunami-of-tickets-from-summer-intern-hires - one just needs two monitors at his desk.

I bring two and install them.

The user says the right monitor is tinted blue.

I'm perplexed. It doesn't seem tinted to me.

I spend about thirty minutes with him jiggling with the monitor settings - hot, cold, contrast, etc, but the user still sees blue - and he gets his manager to back it up.

Now, I'm going to be a rude noob POS here, but with this company, we have an issue with *everyone* trying to get custom monitors, either from IT, or bought from [insert retailer here] using their division's budget - and I can't blame them, because who wants a sad 22-inch [RHYMES WITH PEMOVO] when you can have a 32 144hz [RHYMES WITH THE SPANISH PRONUNCIATION OF 'JESUS'] monstrosity, especially if you work with editing manuals or design and work in a wing where half the cubicles have them?

I, being a noob, assumed they wanted one of the spare fancy monitors in lieu of the two monitors. (This wasn't too long after I got caught between an exec and her boss nearly get into a shouting match over buying the fancy monitors, while I was trying to install said monitors.) Yes, I'm a dolt for thinking this, because he didn't say *anything* about wanting the new fancy monitors. 

I'm weirded out and tell my mentor, who goes with me.

She reports it's blue, too, and gives me a look. (Note: we both wear glasses.) We replace it with one that was significantly less blue.

I found out why the monitor looked blue and had crappy resolution, as well - one of the monitor brands we use has a new version of one of their models that looks *exactly* the same as the old one until you plug it in, and it has things like ""actual HD support from Apple"", ""doesn't look like hot garbage if you set it to a higher resolution"", and 'doesn't have a weird blue wash to everything'.

She then states ""No I don't need the laptop my power-point along with all my other files were saved onto the external monitor"" My co-worker immediately understood what she was trying to say and busted out laughing. I was still puzzled on what she was trying to tell me. I asked what did she mean? She said ""I always dragged my files from the desktop to this monitor so all my files are on this monitor, so I brought it to hook it up to the TV!"" I then realized why he was laughing so hard, which btw he was still laughing extremely hard. I just stood there in shock being that this LT always like to mentioned she was a West Point grad. Instead of wasting my time explaining it I just went to her office, grabbed the laptop and did what needed to be done. She still didn't see why I needed to laptop when the files were on the monitor.

A week goes by. The summer heat stresses the poor little server in its smeltering hot room even more but it is still holding up. The sensors say 70°C and I get a little nervous.

&gt; $boss, you know, that server can die every minute now, we need an exit strategy. 


&gt; It worked until now, why should it break now? 


&gt; Come on… I won't even argue with that. I won't be available for projects for the next couple of days, FYI.


&gt; But…

And I was on my way, knowing I won't be thanked for any work I would do, but saving the company would be nice. 

First thing I established a fallback for the AD, file server, printer, everything with our head office in another country. With our 100mbit connection this would not be ideal but it would keep us working (besides sending a printing job a thousand kilometers to another country and back to the printer next to you is grotesque).
This took a great deal of discussion if this was really necessary (yes) safe (it's your VPN, tell me) or efficient (hell no) but in the end I had a fall-back if (or when) the server goes belly-up.


Next I gathered the two unlucky interns and started cleaning up the storage cabinet. That was honestly a bit entertaining. The office was relatively new and they must have just crammed all the stuff in there that nobody could decide to throw away. 
Empty printer cartidges worth 5 years of heavy printing (and 75€ in recycling - bought the interns lunch and ice cream), old tech and stuff I just recycled no questions asked and so on. 
Sometimes $boss came along and saw the piles of garbage.

&gt; You can't throw that away, we will need that…


Of course I can and I will. Nobody needs 47 spare VGA cables (yes I counted and the whole office was rocking HDMI or DP since I started taking over). 


But the best part were the documents. The whole company was active in a heavily regulated field. By that I mean third party audits, really high market entrance thresholds and documentation for every little thing. 
That documentation was in this small room. With lots of paper. And printer toner. And a small in size but considerable fire hazard. So as long as this little dragon slept in there I kept all of that stuff somewhere else. 


&gt; Why are these shelves full? 


&gt; Because I like my job (yes, still) and don't want the company lose the very foundation that enables us to work…


&gt; Ok…


The whole ordeal felt like emptying the Tardis. Heaps of stuff the same size as the room were moved. 


Finally we reached the methaphorical bottom and another surprise awaited us. Customer prototypes (classified of course) and a complete CAD workstation worth a couple thousand just sat there and nobody seemed to miss them. 


&gt; Hey $boss did we at some point do projects with x, y and z? Do they maybe want their stuff back?


&gt; What do you mean? Like paper work? They got that ages ago.


&gt; I mean this stuff.


So I proceeded to dump these sometimes bulky prototypes on the desk of $boss just (to annoy him) make sure that they are taken care of. 


Eventually my intern moving crew got the new, very exciting task of calling the former customers and inquiring where to send their devices. You would not believe how difficult it is to get companies to take back their own property.


So after lots of moving and cursing ends this chapter of my epic quest to establish some kind of IT infrastructure that deserves this name and soon™ there will be a story about how I unleashed to Kraken to shorten a discussion about remote support. And that little server was still going strong and got a little relieve when I put a huge ventilator in the doorway to the room so it would not just spontaniously combust...",False,235,18,Luesterklemme,talesfromtechsupport

M: Hello &lt;name of college&gt;, &lt;my name&gt; speaking how can I help you.

T: Hello this is &lt;teachers name&gt; in &lt;classroom number&gt;, the beamer in the classroom is not turning on and I’m teaching a class soon! What can I do to fix it?

M: That is odd I have never heard of a beamer, is it owned by the college?

T: Yes it was your department that set it up.

M: Can you describe what the “beamer” looks like?

T: &lt;Teacher describes what sounds like one of our projectors.&gt;

M: Do you mean a projector?

T: Yes that might be it.

M: Would it be ok if I come and have a look.

T: Yes that is fine but be quick.

I hang up and create a ticket for the issue then head over to the classroom.

3 minutes later I arrive at the classroom.

The teacher shows me the “beamer” and can confirm it is, in fact, a projector. After checking the projector and it’s cables I find out that the plug socket for the projector is switched off. I switch the plug socket on and the projector starts to light up and work.

 Later on that day I spoke to some of my colleague in IT support and none of us can work out where the teacher got the name beamer from except for the fact that the projector beams an image of the computer screen onto the interactive smart board.

289,When you buy price instead of service and product you asked for and I quoted you. You get what you pay for.,"2 years ago I did some consulting and maintenance it job for a construction business. I couldn't get along with one of the managers there. The kind of I know it all Ive seen it all you are trying to overcharge and whatnot. Micromanagement squirrel.

They planned to move into a new office and asked me for a quote. 25 offices. 2 employees per office and they will make a move in with voip phones too.

Open walls. Easy job. 4x cat5e per office and 5 more for printers and plotters. Office was huge. So I quoted fairly because the office was huge.

Well micro squirrel know it better and got a 1/4 of my quote deal with CAT6 wire. I honestly didn't want to lower my price because it was a fair one and going from cat 5e wire into cat6 one for the same price would be nuts. 

Everything went well and good till 2 weeks later I got called for consult and got asked some question about my old quote and why I quoted so many wires. I was like: ""Whaa? What do you mean so many? one per station and 1 per phone. It was a bare minimum actually to make it work just right""

Deal guy installed 1 cat6 wire in each office. They had to buy little netgear 5ports gigalan switches to plug everyone. So 25 offices = 25x about 50$ switch = 1250$. 

2 stations and 2 voip phones on a switch on a single wire. Yeah. Great.

Voip guy was also pissed like hell; he was supposed to install phones with poe switch (power over network wire) and couldn't do it because of the stupid switches everywhere so he had to supply adapters for every phone. it cost them about 30$ for every phone. Overall stupid mess. so 50x30=1500$

It was bad. Bad. BAD! Systems were losing printers. Printers were losing systems. People on the phones were working inside huge caves on the moon with huge delays and echos over the phones. They actually got an ultimatum from the voip guy: you fix your network bs or I take everything back and then sue me.   

What we could do to fix it? Easy: 3 more wires into each office and because walls and some parts of the ceiling couldn't be accessed it would be over 200% our original quote. 

Squirrel ass: ""You mean minus the wires already installed.""

No. 200% of my original quote to add 3 wires into each office.

Yeah we got the job 2 days later. We did it during construction vacation period so it was a very relaxing job. Empty walls so it wasn't so bad. we also used the previous wire to drop ours.

291,"Vacuum: 1, Server Rack: 0","Hello again, TFTS! This story happened a few months ago, but I was just reminded of it and figured it'd be worth sharing with y'all. No disgruntled clients this time, just a tale of a spouse and a server rack. 

The cast:

* $Me: hi! :D
* $DW: my Dear Wifey

I have a few small clients on the side with my small business, mostly maintenance and remote support when they have an issue. Unless it's an emergency, most of this work is at night or on the weekends when I'm not at my day job, and said day job is flexible enough that I have been able to leave early on the rare occasion that one of them has a crisis. For the most part, it's maybe 5-10 hours a week between all my clients, so not that much work really.

I have a small server rack at home that hosts mine and $DW's websites, runs our home file/media server, and is a testing ground for various VM's and projects for myself and my clients. The rack itself has three small servers, a battery backup, modem/router/switch, and external backup drive with a label reading: ""GRAB IN CASE OF APOCALYPSE"" ($DW's idea, since she would have no clue otherwise what to grab in case of emergency). Also, there is a power strip running across the middle of the rack, with six outlets facing outward (important later), and more facing inward to power the various attached devices. The power strip is connected to the battery backup, as are all three servers (also important). This little server rack sits nicely between our desks, the twinkling of blue and green lights keeping us company during our gaming marathons and work sessions. The outlets on the front are usually for charging phones or cameras, and occasionally a computer or monitor when doing repairs.

One lovely evening, it dawns on us that it's trash night. $DW and I collectively sigh, and pause our raiding for a moment of adult responsibilities. $DW offers to vacuum around the office and scoop the litter box if I take the trash bags down and empty the vacuum when she's finished. I agree, and we set to our tasks.

Now, our condo has everything upstairs except for the garage, where the trash bins are stored during the week. I load up all the trash (because more than one trip is for sissies), and start walking down the stairs to the sound of the vacuum rolling across the carpet. I get the bins loaded, hauled out to the curb, and start to close the garage door when I hear the vacuum power down. A strange, high pitched whine can be heard, but it's hard to pinpoint what the source could be as the garage door is rumbling shut. I head back inside, and notice the whining is notably louder now, and coming from upstairs. As I take the last step up, I'm greeted by a mortified $DW, her eyes wide with fear.

&gt; $DW: I think I did something bad...

I start to open my mouth to ask ""what"", but the shrill sound from the office has my attention. I walk past DW and into the room, and cover my ears. Damn, that thing is loud! In the middle of the room is the vacuum, it's cord trailing off towards... the server rack. The screeching sound is coming from the battery backup, the little light on the front that normally glows blue is flashing red at an alarming rate. All other lights on the server are unlit, no fans whirring, no disks humming softly. Pushing the vacuum aside, I click the buttons next to the battery LCD in an attempt to shut the damn thing up. A few clicks later, and my eardrums are relieved, though I can still hear the faint ringing of the alarm.

&gt; $Me: $DW's *firstname*, what happened? (no terms of endearment are used when my electronic babies are dead, sorry)

&gt; $DW: I was just vacuuming, and the server started to beep. Then everything turned off, and it just went from beeping to a solid tone!

I sighed, and began trying to resurrect the rack. The battery had quieted down to an angry chirp every ten seconds, constantly reminding us that it was dead. The fuse in the power strip hadn't blown, but the battery wasn't giving out any power until it cooled down. From what I could tell, the vacuum pulled about triple the maximum listed amperage the battery was designed to output, and rather than tripping immediately, the battery simply gave its best for about 90 seconds until the charge was too weak, or it overheated and tripped a safeguard. That safeguard switching off took our whole little home network with it, from WiFi to our websites.

I took a moment to explain to $DW what happened, and her already wide eyes bulged out further. Her business is makeup related, so while she knows that everything shutting down at once is bad, she didn't really know how much most of the stuff costs (other than my keyboard, and apparently $150 for a nice mechanical keyboard is *insane*, but a similarly priced Gucci mascara or whatnot is okay).

&gt; $DW: Is anything broken?

&gt; $Me: I'm not sure, but until the battery cools down, I have no way of knowing if anything is fried or not.

&gt; $DW: How much is the battery?

&gt; $Me: About $400

&gt; $DW: o.O    ... and the servers...?

&gt; $Me: Depends on which one... top one is about $2000, middle is around $1200, and bottom is at least $3500.

&gt; $DW: O.O

After a few minutes of back and forth of $DW saying I'm pulling numbers our of my ass, and me showing $DW similar models online for FAR more than that (and enjoying the look of her eyes popping out further, seriously it's adorable when she's like that), the battery stopped beeping, and the blue light of life returned. The fans started spinning up in unison, followed by the vacuum roaring back to life. Scared the hell out of us, $DW yelped and jumped back, and I about fell over from the sudden sound right next to me, before yanking the plug out of the socket. A few minutes of checking everything on the servers, and I happily informed $DW that the only thing she broke was the nightly backup, which was in the process of running when my little computer kingdom came crashing down. 

That was about six months ago. We joke about it now, almost anytime one of us decides to vacuum the office, and sometimes when she plugs in anything other than her phone. $DW even put a little label on the power strip ""NO VACUUM *skull-and-crossbones*"". Seriously, I don't know how she even got an emoji from a label maker, but it's a cute little reminder of the near-death experience our servers had that night.

292,Dealing with users that refuse your help,"TL;DR: User calls with comp troubs, refuses to cooperate out of sheer stubbornness , nothing is solved.

Posted this on /r/sysadmin on a weekly thread, I was told you guys might enjoy it.

This happened today morning.

We receive a call from a small, 2 person satellite office of ours. One of those persons never calls us directly, she just asks the other girl to call us because she's ""too busy"". They're technically partners and equals in their department but there's always a ""boss/assistant"" relationship.

Anyways, co-worker takes the call and it's a desktop that won't turn on (""The CPU won't turn on"". Anyone else have users that call the desktop case ""The CPU""?).

He's going through the normal debugging steps; check for loose cables, if cleaning lady didn't accidentally turn off the PSU's switch on the back, plug in another thing to check the outlet is working, etc. Nothing seems to work.

For context, we're a small team of 2 which are hired specifically to attend to our location's problems which are all sales/accounting/payroll issues. We're not technically supposed to be solving other office's problems but we do since we're ""the IT guys"". That means we can't physically go to the office since it's a 2 hour drive on peak-hours then another 2 hour drive back. And anyways, the user's job requires her to work on that office on the morning and then come to our office since theirs requires to close at 1:00 PM.

So co-worker asks a sensible and understandable ""We'll then just disconnect the computer and bring it here, we'll check it out"" to which she immediately and without any sense of irony or respect replies:

""No, I won't do it"".

Partner is dumbfolded. ""Why? It's easy I can walk you through and it'll take you 1 min and you can't work anyways...""

""No, it's just too much work. I won't do it. Thanks for nothing.""

And then proceeds to tell him of another problem with the other lady's scanner that isn't working, but she's currently dealing with a client so she can't answer the phone or do tests.

""Ok then"" co-worker replies ""then call me back when she's done or bring us the scanner later when you come here anyway...""

He immediately gets put on hold, and then the same reply

""She says we can't do it. She doesn't want the scanner disconnected"".

Co-worker ""Ok, then we can't help you if that's the status of things. We'll put it on a to-do list and deal with it when we can go there. Is there anything else we can help you with?""

""No, nothing"" *click*

293,We totally swear we have approval!,"So I run an IAM platform for a large organization. Part of that is moving all access requests to our platform so that a centralized access admin team can administer all requests. There was a big compliance issue opened because one of our business units was doing their own access administration, so we have to move everything into our platform, but in a nonstandard way. 

The technology group swears they have permission from all the application owners to use their application as a launch pad for their access requests. I go through the pain of setting up several assets and an SFTP route for them to send in their profiles/roles. 

Today I get a call from the app owner who says he never gave permission for this and he wants it removed - problem is, since our app is a controls tool, we can't remove an instance once it's been created. He yells at me for 20 minutes while I try to explain I was lied to by tech. He finally accepts that and apologizes for yelling at me for Tech's mistake. Then I get an email from the project manager saying the project is shut down indefinitely until they figure out how they want to handle the nonstandard stuff.

I checked his Account on the Server and - surprise surprise - it was locked down due to too many failed login attempts. I wonder how that happened.

Story

We have a printer in one of our departments that always gives us a lot of trouble. It tends to disconnect itself from the network, break down at inopportune moments, etc. This printer is plugged into a wall outlet. Also plugged into this wall outlet is a WAP since wi-fi was a late addition to this floor, per $OM's request, who saw me install it, saw where I plugged it in, and saw me hide the wire behind some desktop objects. WAP takes up the only port in the general vicinity of the printer, so for the time being (when the budget has it in it to replace the WAP with one mounted on the ceiling), the printer is plugged into a port on the WAP. I think y'all see where this story is going.

I get a call from the a doctor. Calls are reserved here for the most urgent of IT issues. He's unable to print, and a patient needs a report immediately so they can leave. I remote in, and see that the printer is offline. Great. This printer has a tendency to do this. Check the print server. It also says that the printer is offline. Even more GREAT. So I make my way down to their floor and begin to check the printer. Is it plugged in? Yes. Are there any errors on the printer? No. Is it plugged into the AP? Yes. Is the WAP on? NO. I check the power supply, and it's plugged into the WAP, so that's fine, but then I check the wall.

And what do you think I find? The WAP is unplugged. And a $fruitphone power brick is in its place, connected to none other than $OM's cell phone. I plug in the WAP, and put the charger on $OM's desk. I may have slammed it down. 

The following conversation happened in loud tones

$me: You did not seriously unplug that to plug in your phone.

$OM: It looked like a phone charger (note: no phone charger has an actually attached wire to it anymore, unlike this)

$me: HOW?!

$OM: It's not labeled. How am I supposed to know it's supposed to be plugged in?

$me: maybe you ASK before you unplug something. Something you asked me to put there in the first place. Now you've wasted my time, the patient's time and the doctors.

$OM went back to work angry. Meanwhile, I grabbed a label out of a label printer and attached it to the WAP power supply with the words ""DO NOT UNPLUG. $ME WILL KILL YOU."" in red sharpie and all caps.

303,"Quantum, Sailor, and the Case of Dumb Luck","Back when I was but an IT tech noob, I was working in a corporate hospital ($themed), and I'd gotten a call to run a ticket to install a user's (a nurse director, mind you) desktop printer she wanted added to her device that she'd brought from home. Back in those days, we allowed that kind of thing. When I left that job, things like that were not permitted anymore.

Anyway, I go in to this XP machine and start setting up drivers and such from disk, as was needed back in those days, and plug in the printer, and fire off a test print. Works great. As a general rule, I like to reboot and confirm everything is still working properly.

It proceeded to shit the bed.

And I, being the tech noob I was at the time, absolutely terrified. I'd trashed this nurse director's office machine. I don't even know what I did. So I did what any good tech noob would do. I called in reinforcements. First was the Sailor, who was significantly smarter than I was, and I thought for sure could figure out how I broke this poor innocent machine. After 30 minutes of trying all kinds of stuff, we decide to call in the big gun, Quantum.

Now, Quantum was the guy you'd call when no one else could figure out what was wrong. He was the number one, top person in the entirety of IT that, if he didn't know it, it wasn't beyond him to figure it out.

So Quantum joins the Sailor and myself, and, for another 30 minutes, this device is just trashed. No one can figure out what happened. So Quantum starts pulling data for recovery purposes to take to build another device for this director, and we proceed to prepare to talk to the nurse director, letting her know her device was dead.

It was right before we walked out of the room that the Sailor had one more idea. He reached behind the printer I'd installed, pulled the USB cable from it, and rebooted device.

And hark, it sprang back to life like the last hour and a half had never happened.

We both praised the Sailor for his ~~luck~~ brilliance and I was super appreciative he saved me from having to look super dumb in front of this nurse director I didn't know yet.

It was not until years later I would understand the power of corrupt drivers and how much damage they could cause. You never know what is going to break a machine these days, but my recommendation is to always check the easiest thing first, it has saved me so much time and effort over the years.

My small business customer of about 40 employees, I do IT stuff for, decided to move office into a new building. Open walls; need network wiring. Easy job. I quoted good network cables almost 40% under market price for whole job; him being good customer and whatnot. 

Well I heard back from one of the owners; he found a guy who will do it for half my price and if I'm interested to match it. I was like: ""Wtf? How? Fuck that!"" Unfortunately I couldn't do it but could of course do all the wall-plates and patchpanel-serverroom job to make everything work at my usual per hour fee.

Everything was fine; I was supposed to get there on Friday and complete all job. One day doing network stuff will change me of usual desk-sitting I usually do. I'm all set with my wall plates, patch cables, patch panels and even more patch cables.

Office is opening on monday morning. All desks are set and all equipment had been moved by moving guys; they did a hell of a job btw. So lets get back to my end of the deal.

At first I was damn impressed by wiring job: all cables are neatly identified with marker on electrical tape; it does the job. Good. 

OMFG! 911! there is only 1 network cable in the server room. WTF? HUH? The other 59? Left in the ceiling? Found a ladder; thanks to electrician still working on lights. Nothing in the ceiling besides 1. FREAKING ONE network wire.

WTF? I have 2 network wires coming out of every hole in the wall; where did damn guy moved all the end of network cables? After checking everywhere in the office and in all broom closets: nothing!  It's time to call the big guy. 

(calling, explaining, guy is freaking out, on his way in the new office...)

By the time he got there I figured out what happened: wiring guy wired 1 single wire from server room into the first hole. 1 wire from 1st hole into the second hole, from second hole into the 3rd... you get the picture. Electrical wiring 101. ALL OF THEM!

Dis gonna be good.

What are you going to do to fix it? Me? Fix it? I need to have 60 wires in the server room and I have 1 usable. How do you want me to fix it? Its not a fix; its a whole job! Call the damn witing guy. He is not taking calls. Got paid cash. Umm. What are the options? 

About 60 network wires total. Finished walls with soundproof stuff in there. I'm damn sure I'm not doing it myself. Are you nuts? Must call two of my other techs guys. Its going to be 300% market fee and its a good price trust me on short notice. Sure you can make some calls. 40 minutes later I got the job. I'm sure the price he got made him realize I'm not trying to screw him over.

Our security policies say it is not authorized to have a program update a production database without attaching a name to the update so naturally I assume the program has details about who is logged into the system. Nope. As I'm talking about this with the person on the phone, the person next to me is in security controls and gets involved. She states what we are doing is not allowed and I need to notify someone.  
So I go over to the team lead and detail the problem and how what we are doing is not allowed and goes against our standards. Lead immediately goes into CYA mode. He says the inserts are not done by an unknown ID but are done through a DB insert triggered by the proforma so it is legal. I state again, updating database records without capturing an ID is against our corporate rules.  
If I go to corporate about this, the team will know who brought it up. It's my most important team and takes up the majority of my time. The team can choose to drop me if they want and do training through India. It's not the best option, but it is an option.  
Security and Controls wants me to create an issue about this. The application team wants me to stay out of it.  
I'm going to raise the issue further up the application teams tree first but I do not expect anything to happen there either. Me and the head guy don't always see eye to eye because I bring up issues like this that he wants to ignore.

“Aye, that’s right! There’s this guy on vacation, and I just went to lunch, and now I can’t place or receive orders - and I need the account unlocked!”

*Irrational humans who speak inconsistently and without following any sort of lines. My favourite.*

“All right, Sir – let’s see if I can help you! Can you give me your user-ID, please?”

“**Mine**?”

“Yes, Sir, yours.”

“Um, all right, but…”

*He starts giving me letters, but then, he mumbles something, and then changes his mind, and changes the letters. He gives me his user-ID. I look it up. I confirm his name and his phone number. I check the status of his account. It’s not locked out, as far as I can see.*

“Excuse me, Sir, but is it a password reset you need? Because as far as I can see…”

“No, I just want an account unlocked, with the old password!”

“Sir, as I said – if you cannot get into your account, most likely your password has simply expired. Your account is not locked out.”

“No, but it’s not for *me*, though!”

“It’s not for you?”

“*It’s not for me!”* 

*It’s not for him.*

“So… Whom is it for..?”

“It’s for the guy on vacation!”

*Of course. Of course it’s for the guy on vacation. Who else would need his account unlocked..?*

“So – just to confirm your issue, Sir – you want me to unlock *someone else’s* account for you; someone who isn’t there to verify that you’re allowed access to his account?”

“Hey! Don’t *put it* like that!”

*I ponder for a second how else I could have possibly put it, but give up once I realize for the gazillonth time that the Users from The Abyss have no logic supporting their actions…*

“All right, then, Sir… Would you please give me your employment status? Are you the Manager? Account operator or Administrator? Any position that would indicate *permission* to access another user’s account?”

“I can give you his name and ID!”

*He’s flustered. He’s going to blow. Not now, but it will happen. I wait for an explosion from The Abyss.*

“That’s all very good, Sir, and we’ll get to it if we get that far, but I need to know your position at the company.”

“Look – I can give you all his details, and I’m not the one who locked him out of his account! I told you, I’ve got fire up my arse and I need to do this, *now*!”

“Calm down, Sir, and would you please confirm your status at the company?”

“I’m, uh… I am, eerh…”

*I can see his account. I can see his position. He doesn’t have the access needed. I just want to hear him try. He pants.*

“Look, hey, just unlock the account, so that the entire company doesn’t *collapse* because we can’t handle the orders coming in! I’m ***basically*** the manager anyway!”

“Excuse me, Sir – you’re *basically* the manager..?”

*I’m almost impressed. No one’s pulled that one before.*

“Yeah, yeah, I’m *basically* the manager now, because the manager and everyone else above me is on vacation!”

*I mute to chuckle. I’ll remember that when my boss is on vacation – I’ll just tell everyone I’m ‘basically’ the manager…*

“I am very sorry, Sir, but…”

“Look – can you just..? Just unlock it for me, all right?! It wasn’t *me* who did this *stupid* shite anyway – it was this other bloke!” 

*There’s another bloke involved in this. Of course there is another bloke.*

“Someone else besides you had access to this user’s account?”

“Well, yeah!”

*He says it like it’s the most natural thing in the world; like I’m the one breaching protocol here.*

“We were using this person’s account, because he’s the only one with permission to place and receive orders, and then I went to lunch, and that other arsehole *idiot* – sorry for cussing – tried to bloody login *five* bloody times – sorry again – with the wrong *pass-bleedin’-word*, and now we can’t get in and place or confirm orders!! I went away, and the other guy tries to login, and he doesn’t succeed – and what does he do then? One sure as *fuck* doesn’t try *five* bloody times with the password that *didn’t work in the first place!!”*

*Oh, the humanity... At this point, I’d be well within my rights to tell him to sober up and talk to me as an adult human male – but I’m not petty like that. I’m petty in a much worse way.*

“No, that does sound awful, but this is very much against the rules – unless you had some sort of employment status that indicated your right to access the accounts of other users in cases of emergencies…”

*He sighs. He breathes deeply.*

“Can you just *look* at the account for me, please?”

*I scratch my itching scull. I check the account. Ah… *This bloke* is the manager, and nowhere – to my infinite, reversed surprise – does it say that the user I’m speaking to has any granted, acceptable access to his accounts or devices.*

“So, Sir… Sir?”

*He pants.*

“Sir..?”

“Yes? Will you please unlock the account for me??”

*I hear others in the background now. They are yelling. Some argue what the original password actually was. Some ask why the account isn’t unlocked yet. The dude I’m talking to goes bananas.*

“NO, *GARY* – THE PASSWORD WAS *NOT* ‘ZEBRA500’, AND I’M TRYING TO TALK TO A BLOKE IN IT TO UNLOCK IT *RIGHT NOW*!!”

*Oh, the urgency… I try to imagine in my mind a place of work where the entire company just goes under because **one guy** went on vacation. I don’t envy these people one bit… I do, however, have a job to do myself, and I cannot risk this sort of security breach. Even if I would want to help them, they are doing exactly ***everything*** wrong right now, and my calls are monitored.*

“Um, excuse me, Sir..?”

*Also, he called me a 'bloke'.*

“Yes?” 

*He speaks between his teeth.*

“Sir, according to my records here and according to *any* sort of common security sense, I *cannot* unlock the account for you, and I will *definitely* have to do a password reset – but to do that, I need to speak to the user to whom the account belongs.”

*He sighs. Deeply, painfully.*

“Are you *sure*?”

“I am sorry, but the security guidelines are very clear on this. His account has been locked out, multiple people know his password – or some form of it, it seems - and he is not there to verify any of this. If I had a way to contact him, or if he could contact me…”

“But he’s on vacation!”

“Without his phone?”

“Without his *work*-phone!”

“And none of you have access to the ordering system?”

*He groans loudly.*

“The only other guy who has permission… He’s gone.”

“Gone, Sir?”

“Yeah, he’s *gone*. Not here.”

“All right… Because I really cannot unlock the account for him if he’s neither here nor *aware* of it…”

*He stomps his foot; I can feel the ground shaking from The Dark Abyss. He sighs.*

“Alright… Alright! *Let* the entire company go under! I’ll try and see if I can get a hold of him some way… Maybe he’s on Facebook – who knows..? God dammit! I know it’s not your fault, but God dammit! God dammit, *Gary*!”

“I wish you good luck, Sir.”

“Yeah-yeah – thanks for… Well, for listening to this shite, I guess… Good bye.”

“Good bye!”

*He hangs up.*

*Oh, such problems… And to think – on the day when he was basically the manager…*

308,Do you know anything about phones?,"Working on fixing computers and supporting people as IT means that we end up spending a lot of time sitting down or indoors. I find that computers tend not to like the outside, what with the corrosive liquid falling from the sky and the giant ball of bleaching UV radiation.

To combat the stuck-in/long sitting feeling I've been doing after work walks. This helps the mental side of being stuck in while it is sunny outside, get fresh air, etc. The town I walk around is large enough that you won't know most people living there but small enough that you are expected to smile and say Hi when passing others.

So there I am enjoying the sunshine, the sight breeze and the intermittent shade of the trees when I pass another walker. This is not that unusual as you tend to pass others returning home from the bus stop, walking their dogs or just going to the shops.

309,Tales from the olden times,"A long time ago, when Windows NT 4.0 was the new kid on the block, I spent some a few years with the job description of ""The IT Department"" for a company being introduced to the wonders of technology. Here’s two short tales from dealing with one especially bone-headed manager.

I was rolling out the first batch of computers to the warehouse management team. The warehouse manager walks up while I’m unloading some horrible beige Compaq on his desk and picks up the mouse:  
Manager: Ah so this is my new mole… I‘m very good at using them, you know.  
Me (muttering): I see your knowledge of taxonomy matches your knowledge of management.  
Manager: What was that?  
Me: I said ""Yes, that’s your new mole"".

The same manager about 12 months later asks me to fix a problem with his email. A quick change of settings in Outlook and a restart… Yes, send pending emails now... Yes empty deleted items folder… Restart...  Job done. But then I get a call 5 minutes later.  
Manager: You deleted all of my emails!  
Me: I didn’t delete anything, I just fixed your problem.  
Manager: The Deleted Items folder is empty! That’s where I keep them all - get them back at once!
I had two options here. Option 1 would mean a lot of messing with last night’s tape backup, but I figured option 2 would be more productive here:  
Me: Well I think we learned today not to keep important documents in a folder called Deleted Items.  

It turns out that he’d figured out that pressing the delete key moved his mail to the deleted items folder, and realised how convenient it was to be able to move selected emails easily into another folder. This lead him to believe that this must be a productivity tool for storing priority emails – despite pressing the DELETE key to move the mail to DELETED ITEMS, this was obviously Microsoft’s way for storing important emails.

310,I'll just print the secure form,"Another tale from the service desk I manage.

Not sure if stupid or using initiative or a bit of both!

Our new starter, access requests, permission changes and account forms are all done via a Microsoft app on our intranet site. Easy to fill out takes less than 5 minutes mostly drop down boxes and a few tick ones apart from name, job, date of birthday and a notes field.

This form submits and goes into our queue to be updated and managed. Anyway this morning I get handed a print out of the form from someone who sits near the service desk explaining she was rattled and annoyed when she brought it up last night after hours as it wouldn't work.  

Basically a lady trying to arrange a new starter got so frustrated it wouldn't submit so she's sending us a paper copy. Firstly we have in big red letters on the form it can only be done electronically for audit purposes and security. 

Anyway on closer investigation the user has filled in her own name as the new starter and the manager then put yesterdays date as the DOB and literally not ticked any tick boxes... there's a big bold one at the end which is basically yes I accept terms and understand this form must be done properly.

No surprises nothing new but a simple one to start your days off. Bare in mind our organisation is very funny about names and details being printed on paper and this has been handed around to several people already!",False,77,12,muzzsjm,talesfromtechsupport
311,The Ritual,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

**$Selben** - Previous Tier 1 tech support now an IT contractor - a bit more into his career.

 

**$User** - Company employee, calling in for support!

 

**$Soda** - Entrepreneur and IT Consultant and indirectly $Selben’s boss. Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany. Also had a never-ending supply of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!

 

**$Tech** - The last remaining helpdesk tech.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

The office was dimly lit with flickering fluorescent lighting on their last legs as $Selben entered the office and sat at his desk one morning. Putting on his headset he looked up to see four ~~mysterious robed figures~~ technicians all stand in unison and walk out the door ~~drawing twisted blades~~ reaching for cigarettes as they left. During the ten minutes his machine took to load, $Soda arrived, waving as he passed by to his own cubicle.

 

Recently all the helpdesk technicians, including all the IT managers, had quit, except for one low level tech who had only been there a month. $Selben and $Soda were brought in on temporary contracts to help until the company got staffing back up to snuff. The other temporary techs were normally internal software devs and were filling in until new people were hired. Unfortunately, this meant they didn’t know much more than $Selben and $Soda about company procedures for the helpdesk. Documentation at this facility was completely lackluster. Almost everything had been tribal knowledge, being passed from technician to technician, making it difficult to troubleshoot internal systems.

 

Immediately on making himself available for phone calls, $Selben’s phone rang and he leapt into action!

 

&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling $Company, this is $Selben. How can I help you?

 

&gt; $User: This is $User. Badge reader.

 

&gt; $Selben: Okay, let me just get a ticket started.

 

&gt; $User: Great thanks!

 

*Click*

 

&gt; $Selben: Hello?

 

The caller had hung up… $Selben began to fill in the ticket, but before he finished another call came in. He scribbled a note to himself to finish after the call. This user had a complex issue that took right up to his 20-minute call goal but managed to finish it at the last moment. He glanced at his note from the previous call, but his phone rang again before he could touch it. This repeated over the next couple hours, including getting several calls from other users who only stated their name, followed by “Badge reader,” before hanging up.

 

Getting annoyed by the abrupt calls with no information, he put himself on extended call completion so that he would stop getting calls temporarily and walked over to $Soda’s desk. As he approached he noted the other techs had gone on their fourth smoke break of the day, so it was just the two of them.

 

&gt; $Selben: Hey $Soda.

 

$Soda sighed and put himself on extended call completion.

 

&gt; $Soda: What’s up bud?

 

&gt; $Selben: Have you been getting weird calls about…

 

$Soda completed the statement for him.

 

&gt; $Soda: Badge readers?

 

&gt; $Selben: Yes!

 

&gt; $Soda: Indeed, it’s very odd. I was trying to find documentation for it, but there’s nothing. Let’s check with the other guys when they’re back.

 

Feeling satisfied there was at least a plan, $Selben headed back to his seat. Before he made it, a random user from the office caught him ~~with a snare and dragged him kicking and screaming from his cubicle~~ and asked he look at something on their computer. It took nearly 30 minutes. The user had managed to unplug and attempt to plug back in their VGA cable upside down. After some pin unbending due to no extra cables in the supply closet, $Selben got it working again ~~and was able to escape with his life~~ and returned to his desk to find chaos unfolding.

 

Two of the four techs were having a yelling match with a company VP, while the other two and $Soda were frantically taking calls. The call queue had blown up—it seemed none of the badge readers were functioning. $Soda finished his call and somehow got everyone to calm down.

 

&gt; $Soda: Okay $Tech, what did you do in the past when the badge readers stopped working?

 

He quickly got heated again.

 

&gt; $Tech: I don’t know! I was never involved, I just created the tickets that they called.

 

&gt; $Soda: Okay, don't worry, just think. Walk me through a call, would you transfer it or do something else?

 

&gt; $Tech: They would call, give their name, and then hang up. I’d then go and look them up to create a ticket and would ask them to call back if they still needed help. They never would. Eventually I would just close the ticket.

 

&gt; $Soda: Wait wait… Where would you look them up?’

 

&gt; $Tech: I opened the badge reader app, logged in and searched for the user to make sure they were there. They always were. Then I’d create a ticket and close the app.

 

&gt; $Soda: Show me…

 

After only a minute of $Tech showing him what his process was, $Soda stood up beaming and called out to the $VP.

 

&gt; $Soda: Hey $VP, if I can fix this issue permanently, will you buy us all gyros from the corner food truck?

 

&gt; $VP: Of course! No one else has been able to fix it since we got the readers years ago!

 

$Soda opened the badge administrator application and logged in. Quickly selecting all badge readers company wide, he went to their shared settings, and turned off…the sleep timer. He had realized searching for the user woke the badge reader up, causing it to work after the user called in.



An hour later, all the techs were happily eating their gyros.



Unfortunately, due to the length of time this issue had gone on, most users were still repeating the ritual of calling in, stating their name, “Badge Reader,” and hanging up, before even trying to use it. $Soda suggested making a prompt on the tech support phone line for badge readers that would go straight to voice mail and be automatically deleted after a set amount of time, and $Selben was asked to implement it. $Soda and $Selben received more gyros for this as well.",False,1483,75,Selben,talesfromtechsupport
312,Microwaves,"Hello all.  I'm Shooxjat, and I work at a school.  We have a one-to-one laptop program for grades 6-12 and let me tell you, I love students.  I also love weird issues.  This is good for my job, though the amount of ""weird"" issues I've had have been dropping steadily.  I don't know whether to attribute this to students getting better or me just getting used to it.  Anyway, on to this story!

$Me: Shooxjat, school IT

$Kid1: Student with a broken computer

I'm eating lunch one day in my office when I get a kid running into my office.

$Kid1: Mr. Shooxjat, my computer's in a microwave!

$Me: ...Huh?  Take it out of the microwave! (I'm trying to process the previous line. My mental error checking must have been deep.)

$Kid1: No, my computer's in a microwave!

$Me: Okay, so take it out of the microwave?

I'm ashamed to admit at this point I'm going to skip over some rather circular dialog, but this went around a few times more than I'm typing.

$Kid1: But you don't understand, my computer's in a microwave!

$Me: I think I do understand, and step one is to take it out of the microwave.

$Kid1: No, my computer's in a microwave!

$Me: Have you tried taking it out of the microwave?

$Kid1: Yes, my computer was in a microwave and someone turned it on!

Now, eagle-eyed readers of this post may notice the rather abrupt change/clarification of tense in the last line.  I certainly noticed it.  Also... it was in the microwave when the microwave was turned on?  This can't be good.

$Me: Okay, well, where is it?

At this point, $Kid1 takes the computer out of the bag he's got, and hands it to me.  The first thing I notice is that fine eldritch scent of burnt electronics.  That combination of burnt metal and burnt plastic that we all love so, so much.  I went through the song and dance, and confirmed that it was dead, gave the kid a spare and he left.  I later found out that $Kid1 and $Kid2 were arguing about something, and $Kid2 grabbed $Kid1's computer from him, and put it in a microwave and turned it on.  When asked why he did that, $Kid2 said ""I thought he was going to stop me, but he just stood there!""  We all were in shock when we heard this, much as I suspect $Kid1 must have been when his computer went into a microwave.  $Kid2's family had to pay to replace the microwave, and the deposit on labor for fixing the computer, which rather surprisingly to me came out to 0 dollars thanks to $Manufacturer counting it as ""accidental damage"".

313,&lt;bleeping&gt; Excel &lt;bleeping&gt; IT policies &lt;bleeping..........,"Our IT Department supports the installation but not the use of MS Office products. As such we generally turn around any support related issue back to the user community. However on occasion we will support when users encounter something unusual.

I get called into some of these for Excel. In this case first tier support gave up on the business manager as he was abusive and uncooperative. 

They ask for my help. I review the ticket. The manager has put multiple curse words into the ticket explaining how we've screwed up the network and now this spreadsheet which is critical to month end close is not working. In reviewing the ticket I discover it is not the manager with the issue but one of his accountants. So I send her an e-mail and after some back and forth I convince her to send me the spreadsheet so I can see what is happening.

I open the spreadsheet and instantly Excel tells me that there are links to other spreadsheets and do I want to update the data in this spreadsheet based on those links. Not having access to the drive mapping for this department etc I tell Excel no but this is my clue.

Excel allows you to link data across multiple spreadsheets. I go inside Excel to see all of the spreadsheets this spreadsheet links to and oh dear. Two spreadsheets on the users C drive (local to her machine) as well as another spreadsheet on their LAN.

I call the accountant and ask her more about her issues. She is trying to share this with other users in her department and they are getting the failed to update data from her C drive. Ahh we have found the issue. I then spend about fifteen minutes explaining to her how networks work and the difference between her C drive and a folder on the LAN which is shared with her coworkers. Plus I threw in an explanation of how to set up the security on the folder so only the people in her department can use this spreadsheet. At the end of this call I have walked her through setting this up and she has moved the files from her C drive to the network and tested. All is good. I closed the ticket.

Or not.

The manager reopened the ticket and adding even more expletives about IT, Networks, security etc and says this is not fixed to his satisfaction. So I call the user back and talk to her. They did not understand why all of their C drives were not shared across the department. Ahh. So now I give an explanation of why we set the PC's up the way we do and why it is a horrible idea to share everyone's C drive especially if you have anything private on your computer. Not to mention backups, drive failure etc. After some discussion she reluctantly comes around to understanding our method of setting up PC's and the drives etc. I ask her if she wants me to talk to the manager and she says no everything is fine. So I close the ticket again.

Or not.

Again more expletives etc from the manager. I call the user back one more time and she says everything is working and everyone in the department understands (except the manager). I tell her I am going to close the ticket and we will not respond to it being reopened. She agrees.

But the manager must get in the last word and as part of our process we send out a customer satisfaction survey which is  rated as low as possible across the board with you guessed it, more expletives in the comments. I reviewed this with the support manager and he agreed I did well above and beyond. 

I look up the local technical community college on-line and snap shot the classes around Excel and paste into an e-mail to the manager with a sweet message about education but then I thought why bother. This would be over his head anyway. Still... :)",False,150,21,JustAnOldITGuy,talesfromtechsupport
314,The curious case of the reverting hibernate settings,"Posted this elsewhere but thought it'd be fitting here as well. It's a short tale but it was an issue that had me stumped for a while

I had just set a user up with a brand new laptop, he seemed pleased with it and was sent on his merry way. After a week or so he reported that his sleep settings kept resetting back to the defaults. At first i just think hes doing something wrong, so i remote in and set the settings for him and showed him how to do it.

Days later he emails me saying that they reset again. I'm thinking what the fuck?! Next thing i do is walk him through getting to the BIOS and check if there are any settings about it there. He listed all the options and nothing was really relevant to the issue. I tell him I'mgoing to do some research on this and get back with him.

A few weeks go by and still i have found nothing on it for him, I pretty much have given up and got sidetracked by other issues and i forgot about it. At least until i was poking around their DC's group policies for a completely unrelated issue, and low and behold in the default domain policy there's a setting for power options! Fuck me sideways, it was a GPO this whole time!

I call him up and i told him i finally figured out his power options issue, after explaining it to him he had a laugh and as did i and proceeded to wipe that setting out of existence.",False,78,11,PM_ME_SPACE_PICS,talesfromtechsupport
315,"It's supported, until it's not","So. We're setting up a SmallLimp failover cluster - nothing special, and old-school two hosts with failover connected to iSCSI MPIO storage, SQL clustering inside the physical cluster. Completely supported by SmallLimp following their own guidance. This cluster is for one of the client's Big Important Clients.

For backups, the client has multiple Dingus devices. Dingus is a B2D2C appliance that at this location is covering approximately 30 servers instances. It works... acceptably.

Now, I've never built a SmallLimp cluster and had to back it up with Dingus, and Dingus KB doesn't list anything about SmallLimp clusters except when using them for virtualization, which is decidedly not this case. Google-fu doesn't bring up anything useful either, so it's off to the Dingus ticket system.

I explain the configuration - hosts DB1 and DB2 are physical, the CSVs are letters E-K inclusive, and the virtual name for the cluster is DB0. I flat out ask if there's going to be a conflict when backing up to capture DB1 and DB2's OS drive while backing up DB0, which will inerrantly point to the CSVs.

After much experimenting and emails back and forth (most of which were me correcting them that NO IT'S NOT A VIRTUALIZATION CLUSTER) I get the answer ""Yes, that'll work.""

Hurray, off to the races, release the built cluster to the client, who deals with their own DB installs and configurations.

Testing is great. Everything works on the internals, the backups, the failover (tested by physically pulling cables and/or killing needed services), all down the line. Client cuts over the production database on a weekend, and it's running full-tilt.

And the backups die. The direct-to-host C: drive backups spin along like clockwork, going to the virtual host DB0 fails every time.

Well, piss.

Loop in Dingus tech support, pasting the configuration into the ticket and explaining the situation. Immediately ^(Okay, 24 hours later) they come back taking about how to configure it for virtualization hosts.

~~Tear tech services a new one for their inability to read~~ Explain, again, that's not what we're doing. Sits in queue for two days before I get an email asking if they can close the ticket. Get irked, ask if they've actually done any work on the ticket. Things are getting a bit heated.

They check a few things ^(Dubious) and report back there's errors on three drives; we need to run CHKDSK /F on all of them, then run SFC /SCANNOW on those three disks.

Okay, we're into total bollocks territory. Did I mention this server is for Big Client's Client, with a 24x7x365 uptime contract?

Fortunately, we have a quarterly maintenance window of four glorious hours already scheduled. Unsurprisingly, chkdsk and sfc /scannow are both deliciously clear.

Report back to Dingus.

They tell me ""that configuration isn't supported"" and a link to the KB. Full stop.

**This aggression will not stand, man!**

Rope in my boss, who has a direct line to Dingus's CTO. Tell my boss about my desire to tear them a new one. He tells me, ""Go for it, also email CTO@Dingus and me, to loop everyone in.""

I escalate, then go back through the Dingus KB to see if I actually missed this.

No, I didn't. The origination date on the KB was the day ***after*** I got the unequivocal go-ahead from Dingus engineering.

I'm working with senior engineers now, after telling the CTO we're looking at moving this client - and their two devices - to something else if we can't resolve this garbage.

317,2 Lines...Can I Get a TL;DR?,"Today was a bit of a special day for the people I work with. Stupid questions and requests were the theme, but that's kind of my job these days (we're pretty short-staffed). Still, the impatience of one of our managers was just a bit too much.


Key Participants:


**$Me**: Disappointed Author


**$SV**: My direct supervisor


**$MG**: A second-level manager at my workplace


**$EA**: Executive Assistant


Rewind to yesterday, and I get an instant message from boss:


&gt;**$SV**: **$MG** will be coming over there in a bit to ask you to update a map. It shouldn't be a big deal.


This reality never materialized, and with us down about 20-25% of our staff, I wasn't about to go looking for extra work. It's been finding me plenty of late, thank you.


Now we're at today, and I overhear **$MG** talking to **$SV** about this map, wondering what came of it. **$MG** then comes over to ask me.


&gt;**$MG**: **$SV** asked you yesterday about updating our map, did you do that?


&gt;**$Me**: No, he told me that you would be coming to talk to me about it, but you never did.


&gt;**$MG**: Oh, I thought he was going to.


&gt;**$Me**, What do you need done? It should only take a couple of minutes.


&gt;**$MG**: We need to reassign one of the territories from one person to the other.


Side note: The map marks territories from some traveling employees. There are only four, meaning four colors. What was being asked is that I open Paint and use the fill bucket to change one are from one color to the other. We've had issues in the past where users don't make updates to master copies of documents (instead keeping their own, updated copies and leaving the master files out of date), so IT has basically decided we'll handle anything that acts as official work documentation to avoid these mishaps.


&gt;**$Me**: Oh, sure, that'll just take a second...done


&gt;**$MG**: Great, can you print me 5 copies for a meeting tomorrow and e-mail it to **$EA** to send to everyone here?


&gt;**$Me**: Yeah, let's go grab these off the color printer and make sure they came out OK


Yeah, I have a tendency to make sure color print outs come off OK, as our color printer can be difficult...which it was.


&gt;**$MG**: Looks good, thanks.


&gt;**$Me**, staring at the paper he's holding: Wait, why is that blue? It should be gray, but it's come out about the same blue as the other part. Let me get rid of those and try to fix it, it might be a bit.


I tried reprinting, and it just got worse. The gray went back to gray, but a red hue was spread across the pages. I decided to send off the e-mail before I forgot, then I would deal with the printer.


&gt;**$Me**, via e-mail: **$EA**, here is the map **$MG** requested. Don't let anyone print it for a while, the color printer is being difficult.


&gt;**$EA**, in an e-mail to all staff: Please see the attached update to the staff map. The only change is the reassignment of one territory. **$Me** advises that the color printer is being difficult right now, so please avoid printing color copies for a little bit while he tries to sort it out.


Not 2 minutes later, **$MG** has caught up to me as I head back to attempt number 3 on fixing this dumb thing.


&gt;**$MG**: Hey, how are those print outs coming?


&gt;**$Me**: I haven't figured out the printer, I told **$EA** to make sure no one uses it for a bit.


&gt;**$MG**: Oh, well, I didn't read it, I just sent a copy for myself to the printer.


&gt;**$Me**, to myself, dying inside: Are you kidding me? It's been, like, 20 seconds.


Management has now deemed e-mails with two lines of text (totaling 3 sentences) too much of a hassle to actually read. His print out didn't come out right either, so I had to toss it with the rest of them. It turned out the magenta cartridge was faulty and just kept smearing toner across pages.

318,“The students can see my hard drive!”,"My job primarily involves supporting a learning management system at a university. Yesterday, I opened a ticket with the following description: “I can’t open a syllabus file on my course page. Every time I do, it takes me to my hard drive.”

I go to her course, masquerade as her, download the file, and everything is working normally. I screencast the download and send it to her as evidence, figuring maybe she tried to access the file at a time that we were updating the LMS and something went wrong.

She responds to the ticket today, “I’m still having problems, please call me.” I double check everything is working and call. 

Me-M Her-H

M: Everything appears to be working on my end, could you describe the issue in more detail?

H: When I click on the link to my syllabus, it accesses my hard drive.

M: Uh do you mean when it takes you to the Save As dialog box? It’s supposed to do that.

H: No, it goes to my hard drive. Why don’t you come by and I’ll show you how it looks on my computer? (This is not how we operate, at all. We usually only give phone/online support, although faculty are welcome to visit our office.)

M: Why don’t you send me a screenshot of your issue... *I go on to explain how to take a screenshot, and she miraculously gets it right the first time and sends it.*

Yes ma’am. It’s working properly. You’re using Chrome so this is opening up the Save As dialog box so you can save the file.

H: But when I view this page as a student, it opens MY hard drive.

M: Yes, ma’am, because you’re using your computer.

H: But when a student opens it, they’ll be able to access my hard drive!

M: *Trying not to laugh* Ah no ma’am, the save as dialog box will only show the files on their personal computer or laptop. It will not show them yours. 

H: Also, if the file is already saved to my computer, why is it asking me to download the same file when I click the link?

M: It’s...it’s because you’re clicking a link to download a file. 

Over the next five minutes I explain to her how download links work and reiterate that her students cannot access her office computer’s hard drive. Despite my efforts, she mentions three more times, “But students can see my hard drive...” before she finally gives up and says, “Well, if you say so.”

319,Saving you from lots of trouble is annoying,"Hello, this is a short story that I remembered while reading another one in this sub.

I was relaxing with my family the other day, everybody was watching tv or chatting on the phone. When my brother tells me (while still browsing on the phone): 

B(rother): hey, I just got an email about somebody attempting to change my google password.

(I am the tech guy in the family so its usual for them to tell me their problems)

M(e): that’s odd, did you reveal your password somewhere

B: oh yeah, I may have (nonchalantly)

So it turns out he was shopping for some product online and he found a store that sold it for cheap, I advised it looked shady as fuck, but he went and tried it anyway.

M: it’s good that nothing happened, because they didn’t know your secret questions.

B: those things are so incredibly annoying, I don’t understand why they ask them

M: uhhh, they just saved your account?

B: still annoying, they should remove them

M: (brain explodes)

The kicker? Everybody else in the room agreed with him :/

I understand, security can be annoying and not everyone understands how much damage can be done with a compromised email account, but their attitude and responses surprised me, especially when they just saw an example of why these measures exist.

Oh and as a bonus: not 20 minutes later somebody else blocked their account after forgetting their security questions.

I love my family, they are usually quite smart, but there is just something about technology...

320,Too dumb to have a computer,"At a migration project I was a member of a few years back, I was assisting the company IT Help desk department with their tasks, while the project was still in it's infancy stages and my tasks as the logistics guy was not really needed yet.)

It is also important to note that this was mid-winter, where it's not any daylight until 9-10 in the morning.


One of my very first tickets I had to handle was something I had only heard stories about. Namely, the ""return your computer, you're too dumb to own one"" category. 

Now, the ticket itself was innocent enough: 

&gt; 07:30 AM: Computer dead, monitors dead, laptop is working. Need new computer. Please assist ASAP at Room 313, 3rd floor, building F.


Eager to show my skills, this being a new job and all, I assigned the ticket to me and got on my way, all over to the other side of the compound to building F. 


And I could. Not. find the room. It simply did not exist in the hallway in the 3rd floor. Error 404, room not found.

But as Lady Fortune would have it, I happened to stumble upon one of the janitors, who could tell me that the room was not on the 3rd floor, it was most likely room 213, which was on the 2nd floor. Sounded reasonable, it could be a simple typo.. Twice.

And then he mentions that he had just replaced a fuse on that floor and that the section of the floor that room was located at, had been without power the entire morning.


So.. We go and check. Yep, the room seems to be the correct one, username checks out, it's right there on one of the aforementioned monitors. That was supposedly dead. Connected to the supposedly dead computer.
And the laptop? Of course it would work, it was docked, but they had only keyboard and mouse connected to it and it was connected to the wifi, so it was working like a champ.


I had to ask the janitor once more if *all* the power in this section had been gone, which he confirmed. No power, which meant no lights, no running computers, nothing that would require a constant power supply to work, would be running.


It was a case that resolved itself, but you have to wonder: How can you, after having walked through the dark hallways, where the only source of lights would be the emergency escape lights, enter your office, be unable to turn on the lights, then find that you're unable to turn on your computer or monitors, use the laptop to report to the IT department.. That your computer is not working and that you need a replacement?

321,The Broken Password,"At a service desk at a big, big company sits little ol' me, taking business-to-business calls - and after jotting down some of the cases I've handled, a friend prompted me to post here, thinking I'd do a good job of it... So, here goes - The Story of the Broken Password! 


""Welcome to IT-Service Desk, how can I...""

""One of you did something to my password!""

*Interrupter. I love interrupters as much as I love bed bugs and pishmires...*

""Excuse me, Ms..?""

""Yes, hello! I had my password expire, so I called you guys, and one of your colleagues did something to it, and now it doesn't work!""

*Wrap my head around how she thinks her password is a physical constant that you can ""do things"" to...*

""Well... All right. Can I have your user-ID, please?""

""Is that my login? Because my login doesn't work!""

""Um, well, your user-ID - or username - won't be, um, *damaged*, and I need it to check who you are in our system and to reset your password.""

""That's what he said! 'Reset it', he said to me, and then after he did, my password didn't work!""

*Check her ID and verify her name. Her account has been locked out. Too many tries, most likely. I take her number and tell her I'll call back. I breathe deeply, reset the password to something easy and call her back.*

""Hi, it's UnintentionalAss, from IT, and I'm calling with your new password. Are you by your computer, so that we can make sure it works this time?""

""Yeah, I'm sitting here..."" *She doesn't sound happy. Not one bit.* ""...but I'm at the wrong screen!""

""At... The wrong screen..?""

""Yes. There's two screens on my computer, and it's much better to call IT-Service Desk when you're on the other screen!""

*Mute to take a deeep breath, so that I can wrap my head around how she thinks it will actually make any sort of difference which monitor she's on - and the fact that she refers to them as being 'on' her computer.*

""All right, then - you just have to click and hold your mouse pointer at the top of the CertainWebEnvironment-window and pull it across to the other monitor."" 

""Monitor..."" she mumbles.

""The other screen..."" 

“I know that!”

*I doubt that she knows that. I hear her click and pull and really make an effort to move her window, for some inexplicable reason only she knows.* 

""Shall we try again?""

""Yes, we can try.""

*I give her the password. It's a normal word. An easy word. Yet, she manages to do it wrong some way.*

""No, you see?? It didn't work this time either! One of you did something to my WebEnvironment!""

""Ma'am, I can assure you, one of us did not damage your WebEnvironment in any way, and my password should work. Would you be willing to try again, please?""

""Oh, I'll try again - but there's something wrong, I'm telling you!""

*I spell the password out to her, again, very slowly. Yet, there's still a problem somewhere - and if I could take a wild guess...*

""Ma'am, would you please make sure it says 'DOMAIN' and a backslash before your username?""

""Slash?""

""Backslash.""

""Which one is backslash?""

""Well, it's the slash that goes the other way, backwards, towards the name. It's right next to 'Shift' - the thicker upwards-pointing arrow.""

*She struggles. Oh, how she struggles, but it just won't work.*

""No, there's a backslash, but it doesn't work, because the password is wrong!""

*I start a remote session of WebEnvironment. I put in her username. I put in my normal, super easy password. It works just fine.*

""Ma'am, now I have started a remote session of WebEnvironment, and I used your credentials to login. It works just fine on my end, so I can't imagine why it wouldn't on yours.”

*She huffs, presumably getting an ulcer at the sound of all these unfamiliar words I try to use as diplomatically as possible. I have to try again.*

“Are you sitting at your work computer?""

""Yes, I'm at work!""

""Could you log into your computer with this password?""

""No!""

*I rub my temples, confused beyond reason.*

""Then... How are you logging onto WebEnvironment?""

""But that's what I can't do!""

""No, I mean: how are you on the computer if your System-password doesn't work?""

""I don't know, I just didn't log in! WebEnvironment is the first thing I log into!""

""All right...""

*I think. Man, do I think. I think until my scull hurts. Then, I take a wild guess, and I leap.*

""Ma'am, will you do me a favour, please? Will you check at the very left on your keyboard? There should be a sort of half-big button there, with the words 'Caps Lock' written on it.""

*She goes from angry to furious, because this one, she's heard before.*

""I HAVEN'T PRESSED CAPS LOCK! IT JUST ISN'T WORKING! I CALLED YOU TO HELP ME, NOT TO BE A JERK!""

*Suddenly, she's silent. Oh God, what a beautiful silence. I hear a click. She mumbles something. I hear, to my delight, a co-worker of hers chuckle from the distant Dark Abyss of Ignorance. I wait a few seconds. She types on her keyboard.*

""Ma'am..? Did you press Caps Lock?""

*She grunts. She grunts a beautifully shameful, annoyed grunt.*

""No, I didn't! I hadn't pressed it at all, but it works fine now! It fixed itself! Bye!""

*She abruptly and angrily hangs up. I shed a joyful tear. It's finally over...*

322,Routine network maintenance goes wrong,"So this was years ago, back in 2001, and I was working for a company that was riding the wave of capital, just before the dot.com crash.  I was tasked with going and checking all the data jacks under the cubicles and desks in a vacant part of the building that had been occupied, but we were making plans to expand back into.  Tedious work.  All of the cubicles had no chairs, as they had been been cannibalized to other parts of the building.  The only things remaining were the cubicles, the office chair mats, and the occasional piece of office equipment that had somehow been left behind.  So I get work, and start testing the ports.  I walk up to the desk, drop down on all fours, and crawl under it to connect the network scanner.  I'm a big guy, and I can get my work done, but after crawling under 20 or so desks, you start getting tired, and a little unobservant.  So I go walking up to my 24th or 25th desk of the day, and just like I've already done a hundred times, I drop down an all fours onto the chair mat.

Hi TFTS,  
I made a mistake. A big troubling mistake that cost me dearly both in time and my own sanity. I said yes...

##The Fallout

It was a Wednesday morning. Minding my own business I was doing my thing debugging something relatively uninteresting when $boss walks up to my desk:
&gt;You know $luesterklemme, you seem to like this IT stuff and since one of the guys caring for it left and the other doesn't seem to be too interested, maybe you should do it.

Dumbfounded I stared blankly in his general direction thinking of AT-commands.
&gt;Uhm, yes?

Thinking of ordering gadgets and keeping the engineering grunts happy (all power users, seemingly capable), maybe fiddling with an Exchange server, I didn't seem to grasp the momentousness of that reply.

&gt; Sure I can do it. What exactly is ""it"", anyway?

$boss lightens up.
&gt; Not much, really. Hardware for the developers, printers, whatever, maybe a bit of financial planning, keeping the servers running. Simple stuff...

Servers?  
Plural?  
I didn't even know we had one on premise. Let alone multiple. Ok that could be interesting.

&gt; Hm, I will need a bit to get an overview and come back to you when things need to be done.

$boss already on his way to the coffee machine:

&gt; Yeah, sure. Take your time. The guys who did it so far didn't spend much time with it either, so it should be no biggie.

Red flags waving in front of my eyes I finished my debugging and started my quest in the search of the office servers.  
Since it was an open plan office, there was not much room to hide away servers. The meeting rooms and the lab were devoid of anything remotely looking like a server, 
there were no maintenance rooms or even a server room to be searched but I was told somewhere hidden away in a far corner the ""storage room"" could hold the 
faibled thing I was looking for. The inclined reader may now picture a room so small and cramped that the door needed to be opened carefully not to disturb the 
carefully established equilibrium of papers and ancient archives. 
Upon entry a hellish blaze of dry heat flushed my face and somewhere beneath all the dead tree sheets and shelves a faint whirring noise could be heard. 


##The little server that could

As if Gandalf and his dwarven friends I stirred the lair of ~~Smaug the server and was stunned in awe and shock. That little server was there under heaps of stuff and did its thing uneventful and unnoticed for years. 
Fans whirring away it sat on the ground hooked up to an old UPS (lights blinking - battery dead) next to another small server hooked up to the same UPS. 
Connecting a monitor I was greeted with the all familiar log-in screen of Windows XP (or in this case Windows Server 2003) at that point out of support but that didn't matter since there was a backlog of 200-odd updates waiting for the next reboot. 
That thing did everything from file server, AD, print server, mail you name it and was out on the very last limb. The little Linux server next to it was of no concern since it was pretty much just experimental stuff but shutting it off would have hurt nonetheless.
So I scuttled back to my desk and worked on something different and tried to forget what I had just seen.

##Confrontation

The next day $boss came by
&gt; So what do you say? All fine whith the server?

&gt; If it was a horse I would drag it past the barn and shoot it. 
 
$boss stood there dumbfounded.

&gt; That sounds bad. Do we need to order parts? More RAM? HDD? We will need to see what we can do. Can you compile a list so we can talk about it? (Translation: Ignore it)

&gt; That won't help I'm afraid. That room is not suitable for a server or in fact for any electronics at all. There is just too much stuff crammed in there - everything flammable I might add. And I wouldn't be surprised if two hobbits came along with a ring and try to throw it in there. That server is past its time and the software won't get updates. UPS is quite possibly dead and it's a bad design from the beginning. So the only point on the list would be: Everything.

&gt; Be reasonable, we can't just buy a new server. Too much money and time. 

&gt; Ok then I'm on my way to the ""server room"" and test the UPS since I am in charge of the equitment now. You might want to have a look what happens when I pull the plug. Also you might want to write an E-mail to corporate before you can't anymore that the whole office is not getting any work done for the next couple of hours if we are lucky or weeks if the server dies with the UPS.

$boss with a slight hint of panic in his voice stammered something about net losses and working hours and went on his merry way and I started browsing what to get as a replacement server.

325,Your printer has gone mental,"FTP here so maybe dont murder me please?

I have been called to a client who said he had problems printing in A5 format.
The Printer is a multi-tray laserjet with A4-A6 support.
I come over and, sure enough, when I try to print something in A5, this thing prints it on paper from the A4 tray.
I change the system settings to multi-type paper and set tray 2 to A5 (because that's where the A5 paper is), yet nothing.
So I go into the printer config site and check everything up there. I make some changes, save them and... nothing. Printer resets to default.
I try again, different settings this time and the same thing happened again.

&gt; $me: ""That's odd.""

&gt; $client: ""what?""

&gt; $me: ""Your printer appears to suffer from short-term memory loss"".

&gt; $client: ""oh.""

So I try to update the firmware. This printer's manufacturer has provided a simple ""click here to update printer"" tool. I start it up, select the printer from the network. It updates the firmware and everything seems okay..

until it reboots. After which the printer starts randomly switching languages (no restart required!), loosing jobs, printing everything in A3 (which it does not support) and so on.

I print a test page and on it the monochrome printer says: ""Color: yes. Language: ///////""

At this point my coworker was here and after taking a look at the device and the test page, tells the client:

&gt; $coworker: ""Your printer appears to have a dissociative identity disorder. We need to replace him.""

So as of yesterday renovations for the building next to our office has finished and we were tasked with *JUST* moving computers and periphery from each employees temp office to the finished ones. Of course you and I know it's never just computers and periphery. Anyway, everyone got different desks, some were not put together, others were but they weren't optimal for any computer (no outlet holes to plug stuff in) and of course all day we were having to work around users wanting to arrange the room in such a way that they ignore outlets, ports and the like. Then they pitch a fit about cords running across the room. Then there was one guy in particular that had us arrange everything just so, routing all his cables through this 2x1 inch hole in the back of the desk. Basically it took forever and a day to get it wired. Then when we finished, he bitched about the printer cable running around the room (he insisted the printer be on the far side of the room away from him because it is loud) then he decided the tower needed to be on the outside portion of the desk so we had to undo everything and redo it around the desk.

I grab a notepad and pen and start taking down port numbers in every office and carrying a phone around to test them. All but maybe 3 work. I get to the 3rd floor, maybe 3 offices away and run into our unit director, he asks what we are doing, we tell him. He chuckles and says ""Didnt you see the e-mail? [Administrative support lady] sent one about the phones. No one has come out from [Main IT Unit] to turn the ports on."" I tell him no, when and to whom was this sent? He tells me it was sent around 1 (while I was moving computers and therefore unable to check email) and it was sent to the mailing list that included department directors, associate directors, certain other high up people that I am unsure what their job is  and the lead developers. NOT tech support. NOT computing coordinators. NOT anyone I would have bumped into today save for him.

329,They're under embargo!,"I don't know if TFTS is exactly the right place for this, but it feels like it...


Back in 2014, I was doing software development for a health insurance company. I was doing C# development and maintaining legacy ASP.NET WebForms code. This miffed me a bit, because prior to the interview, I was told I'd be writing new code, not maintaining old cruft. But, this was my first week-- I didn't want to rock the boat yet by complaining. 

Since this was a .NET shop, the first thing I do after installing Visual Studio is install ReSharper, a Visual Studio extension made by JetBrains. I use ReSharper religiously. So much so, I buy my own commercial license so I don't have to worry if my current company won't buy it.

Now, this part is important: JetBrains is based out of Prague, ~~now Czechia, then the Czech Republic~~ Czech Republic, *also* called Czechia. 

About 3 weeks into this gig, the VP of development comes at me, red in the face, literally yelling, ""WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU USING JETBRAINS?!?!""

I'm like.... the hell? I tell him that I'm using ReSharper, a widely used, industry accepted IDE extension.

He says, ""TAKE THAT SHIT OFF NOW OR I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL WALK YOU RIGHT FUCKING NOW.""

... Wow. So I open up Control Panel and uninstall it right in front of him. He says that he did me a favor coming over here, because IT would have walked me out immediately, and I wouldn't have a job.

Later the architect comes over and explains that we can't use products made in Czechoslovakia because it's a communist country and under embargo. It's 2014: I respond by saying that it's now the Czech Republic, they're democratic, and a member of the EU. He just says, ""Well, they are still under embargo. Look it up at the State Department.""

I figure out that the only way they knew I was using the software was because it phoned home to check for updates. So I mapped the update server's DNS name to localhost in my hosts file. Worked there 8 more months running ReSharper, had no issues.

On my last day, I decided to raise a stink. Right in front of the VP and architect, I straight up said disallowing ReSharper was a stupid, asinine policy. They got HOT and started talking about embargoes.

I interrupted them and said, ""oh hey. Wouldn't you know, I have two copies of the US embargo list that I just printed off from the State Department this morning. I don't see the Czech Republic on there anywhere. I'm gonna go say my goodbyes and head out now.""

331,When the Apocalypse scenario happens,"Hello there /r/tfts,

I'm writing this after having three Jager shots before even getting undressed, arriving home a little past midnight after what has been probably the only work day to leave me utterly senseless. Let's talk.

Today, 22:30. I (Director of IT, department of one guy) had just gotten off the phone with my boss (CTO). He's been 'assaulted' by a lot recently, from an entire building getting renovated meaning he just had to tell and help some poor blokes (me included), that we need to move a few tons of misc TV equipment by hand three floors down, then two up, between two buildings. Also about how our main antenna aircon is failing and we drop broadcast (note, this concerns a TV station/channel workplace) every once in a while. A lot more, but in short, tiles falling under him from everywhere, but nothing really came close to what i just had to tell him:

&gt; $Cosmitz: ""The entire production fileserver is unrecoverably dead.""


&gt; $bossCTO: ""...""

---------

Flashback time. We had an install of a massive system a while back, three or so years. That install [took away my best friend which i was working with](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3k8zhh/not_your_average_tfts/) at the time. It was a massive tape-to-digital as well as SD-to-HD conversion plus a Media Asset Management system which was followed by a glacial post-install support. 

That support ran for a stated three years or so, in short, everything had ended at the beginning of this month. That included all our broadcast servers, all our production equipment, all the licence support, and generally everything you would think as being mission-critical to a well-running media company. My boss and I have had a lot of discussions about this impending scenario. We knew we wouldn't get financed for a complete package for another two years, which ran up to 150.000 euros, and we started to hack it apart. Figure out backups, what we could live without if something just up and died, something that has been known to happen, especially to our company. In our discussions, we sliced it down to something trivial in price, but apparently it wasn't enough anyway and we didn't get anything. We've noticed more and more cutbacks everywhere, and we were told to 'deal with what we have'. Ours is a sort of a little crooked tentacle in a bigger mess of a megalithic organisation so sometimes, especially with the massive renovation project going on next door out of the same common 'wallet', we can sometimes get pushed aside as non-important.

I knew the corporate structure and economics of where i was employed, so i got to work.

I made a ton of documents showing procedures, workflows, ways stuff could work if X or Y becomes unrecoverable. Legit a few weeks of work. I had also made one for 'production server dies' and in it i wrote a few phrases akin to: 'It's not worth discussing what happens if the production server dies and we don't have any lifelines. If it drops dead, we'll each just go home and get piss drunk and hope the matter goes away in the morning by pure unicorn magic'.

--------

Technically, today was 22 days past the support cut-off date. Practically, it was something nearer to 45ish days on this particular equipment due to our reseller skimping out on some details. It didn't matter for the people i had emailed today for support.

The matter started out with a damaged RAID array, but without any faulty drives reported. After troubleshooting what is an ultra-closed system where the only thing i could really fiddle with was their webgui backend which didn't feature any user-initated rebuilds, i decided to give it a restart with the consensus of the CTO hoping to see some statistics from the RAID controller as it booted up. It really wasn't a big deal. Except when the machine didn't start again. Filled with kernel panic errors of varying casues depending on which restart you were on, no backup disks or even a possibility of using such since, again, an ultra-closed system... i just had to make the call.

&gt; $Cosmitz: ""The entire production fileserver is unrecoverably dead.""


&gt; $bossCTO: ""...""

&gt; $Cosmitz: ""The data should be fine, that's not a problem, however this isn't something they can just remote in and fix even IF they wanted to, and even if we somehow managed to summon up a few thousand euros just to pay for a one year support plan just exactly for this one machine, that'd still imply flying someone out most likely for a few days of work, plus a whole new machine under-arm which we may need to pay extra for.""

&gt; $bossCTO: ""What does this mean realistically for us?""

&gt; $Cosmitz: ""No production at all, everyone can go on vacation for as much as it matters. There are no heroics here to do, no medals to win or statues to get built if we could pull this out of our asses, since we can't. MCR (main control room) will just have to deal with whatever material they already have on the smaller storage machine, just to keep us from dropping to black.""

&gt; $bossCTO: ""I see. Be seeing you tomorrow in the morning and we'll figure what we can do.""

&gt; $Cosmitz: ""Unless we pay these guys, ASAP, that's the situation, and even then... we'll have more downtime than anyone high up is comfortable with.""

We both closed the call without saying goodbye. We both knew it. We were in the Apocalypse scenario.

---------

That was roughly an hour and a half ago, before the shots and my tapping this out here more to get it out of my system.

So yeah, this story ain't over yet but i'm reasonably certain things may happen as a result to this. Including our entire station just getting the axe instead of having to deal with the economic investment from up-high, especially right now in a very unfavorable climate for the organisation. We can squeeze this for a month or so, maybe i can perform some necromancy on older equipment and jockstrap it together, but the moment we need to roll out any sort of heavier production past just the daily news, which will be a feat on its own, we're done.

Here's hoping some unicorns are feeling glittery tonight.

I explained to her that if she changed her password on her laptop at some point, and the keychain wasn't updated, then it wasn't updated with the password she was entering.

334,Apparently you can get Network Connectivity out of thin air.,"Well here I am once again with another tech support story from the call center of insanity. In this case the support came from inside the center instead of over the phone. Let's introduce our cast of characters

$Me: A Strapping used-to-be young lad running short of leash and shorter of patience

$TempLead: The poor but awesome colleague that is at the same level as our hero, but as our 'fearless leader' is on vacation is responsible for all of us and anything we've been dealing with.


To set the stage a little, After July 4th it almost felt like the signal fire for the masses that are being supported by the small queue of a few good men. The phones began to light up the next day, and every day since only proceeded to light up further and faster as many tech issues, both old and tired, and new and confusing began to pop up. Our band of heroes continued to fight valiantly by the day however by the third week it has become exhausting, and unfortunately the latest volley of calls came with an unexpected problem. 

As our Hero came in for the week, drunk with the liquor of a calm weekend and feeling calm and happy he would only take a moment to look at the battlefield board. Already the signs were showing of another long day and fights and issues with numbers reaching high and flashing colors of red indicating the urgency. 

With massive strength of will our quickly started to brew a cup of his finest caffeinated brew and began to arm himself with his systems getting ready to tackle the day once again, but suddenly tragedy struck banishing the wistful dream he was having bringing the cold hard reality that he was a phone jock in a call center to view. Try as he might, he could not connect his system to the network.

As our Hero questioned what was occurring, thinking it might be something small and simple he tried running the basics. Unplugging and replugging the network, checking the IP, rebooting the system. All for naught. Confusion caught on as suddenly the ruling party came and provided info for the woes

$TempLead: Swap the cables around. The network isn't working in one port and swapping seems to help a little letting us connect to the network we need to support.

Yes, instead of the outage coming from outside the walls, we were now in the midst of our own outage, and it was plain to see that if this did not get a workaround soon we would be even more hobbled to the volley of issues soon to hit.

Quickly our hero started to look into this. Trying releasing IP's and flushing DNS with no results. When our hero started to pull up a few things to generate errors, he noticed suddenly that for some odd reason sites with HTTPS would not work, but those that did not contain it would come up.

Curious indeed.

He quickly reported this to to $Templead who puzzled at this as well. Suddenly inspiration struck. He saw something while the system was bouncing connections in the ip release. It made no sense, but maybe something with no sense can work in this place of chaos.

Quickly going back to his system he remembered seeing a wifi signal for a brief moment, and disconnected his network. He waited with baited breath for a minute, and then suddenly it connected and bells rang glorifying in network connectivity. There was a hidden wifi, never told to the basement dwellers, that was also part of the network and it worked. Quickly he tested and found everything working, and spread the word crying out happiness and hope to all. Except for the one person who was on a tower system with no wifi. They decided to use a longer cord to plug him into another working port in another cube.

He announced his triumph to the $TempLead, who groaned his frustrations at the Emperor wondering why we were trying to fix out network issues instead of fixing calls. Still the $Hero felt the buzz of actually doing real tech work, and started to feel inclined he might need a job change.

A few hours later the workaround is still being used, but it was found the DNS had been corrupted to the wrong location. Fixes have been made, but still the network continues to fail.

TL;DR: Network goes halfway down while working with another company who's network is having issues. Apparently systems all have a wifi configuration we were never notified about that works, which helped when everything started to break on the other company's side

335,Sometimes printers DO break computers,"An [earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/910cmc/plug_things_inprinters_dont_break_computers/) reminded me of something I ran into back a few years before I was a paid IT whipping boy.

Back in the mid '90s my dad bought a new PC for home business work.  Since I was already pretty experienced with Wintel hardware, he handed it over to me when it arrived to set everything up.  Things were running smoothly, but they went horribly wrong when I plugged the printer in to install the drivers.  The screen went black, everything stopped responding, and nothing happened when I hit the power button.  I didn't smell any magic smoke but that machine was hopelessly dead.  I didn't think I did anything wrong, though I was still a bit freaked out.  I told my dad about it, and ended up calling the company's tech support.  The guy I talked to was cool about things, but we were stumped.  After some back and forth, they wanted us to pack the machine up and send it back.

After hanging up, I had a sudden thought that I thought I'd investigate.  This computer was still in the AT hardware era where the peripherals (serial and parallel) use ribbon cables bolted to the case's backplane, rather than built into the board.  I removed the screws and confirmed my suspicion.  The internal parallel cable had a non-molded plastic shield that was easy to remove and expose the pins.  There was a defective solder joint that was bridging two of the pins.  So apparently with nothing plugged in, the bridge was harmless but attaching the printer destroyed the motherboard.

The damage was already done, but I was able to fix the connector.  I called support back and explained exactly what I'd found.  I'm not sure the guy was pleased with me tinkering around inside, but I was able to get him to just send a replacement motherboard so I could swap it out.  The operation was a success, the computer had many good years of life, and the printer was no longer homicidal.  I have a suspicion that if I'd sent the PC back, they would have just replaced the board and sent it back, and it would self-destruct again if I'd tried to plug the printer again without identifying the problem.

Lesson learned:  Whenever I encountered peripheral ribbon cables I made a habit of always checking them for defective solder joints.",False,735,63,ExtraStrengthFukitol,talesfromtechsupport

339,And they probably thought they were doing it right...,"**Some background:** I work in a laboratory that runs blood tests for veterinary patients. There are very few tasks in the lab that I haven't done at some point, but these days I mostly work with computers. I maintain our databases, develop new features for the front-end client, and basically do everything from low-level tech support for my coworkers to writing my own LIS software.

One of my biggest projects lately has been the creation of an online submission form. The most time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone step in our whole operation has always been data entry; there's probably a correlation with the fact that anyone to whom we assign the task seems to hate it, but that's another rant. My point is that over the past year or so, I designed and implemented a system that we hoped would take the place of our old paper form, and by having our clients type their own responses, it would save us at least a couple of hours per day. I had little web experience prior to this project, but I designed it all myself, from the web form to the server backend to the integration with our database front-end client. I have a guy in our IT department who makes the changes to the official website, since I don't have the necessary permissions for that. 

The way the system works is that the user enters the information on their clinic, the patient, the test(s) they want, and any other data they wish to provide in order to get more accurate interpretation from our experts. The form is designed to anticipate the most common mistakes our clients could make, and after dealing with them for 8 years, I've come to anticipate their moves pretty well.  
Once they submit the form (by clicking the ""Submit"" button), a confirmation page appears. It shows a barcode at the top, along with instructions to print it out and put it in the box with their sample (a copy is emailed to them at the address they provided, just in case they close the window without printing it). When we receive the sample in the mail, we scan the barcode and the information is populated in our database. This eliminates the need to have someone spend several minutes typing in the (often just barely legible) handwritten information from the paper form (which, I should add, our clients often seem to misinterpret).

So that's the general idea of it. We've been using it for a few weeks now, and as more of our clients make the transition to the online form, it does save us a lot of time and headaches. But a few days ago, I came upon a submission that caught me off guard, though it probably shouldn't have.

**Here's where it gets interesting:** Someone had gone to our website to print out a copy of our old submission form. This time, however, they found the ""online"" submission form. They apparently reasoned that the ""online"" aspect referred to how they acquired a copy, because they proceeded to *print out a copy* of the web page, *write in their responses with a pen*, and stick that in the box with their sample. So of course they not only defeated the purpose of the online form (since we had to manually enter the data anyway), they actually did it in such a way as to circumvent several of the questions that only appear based on the user's responses.

I had to send an email to the  guy in IT that handles the website; we decided to add some CSS so that when someone tries to print it out, **it will only print a short list of instructions on how the form is to be properly used**. While there's a brief instruction section at the top of the form, our clients (with few exceptions) have never been great about reading those. 

Because as we all know, if users think they know what they're doing, they won't ever read the instructions.

**EDIT: Another odd one from the next day...**

I took a phone call from a tech who was trying to get to our old submission form, but when they clicked on the link, it took them to our new online form. They called to find out how to get to the old one so they could print it out.

I explained to them that we were phasing out the old one and gave a quick run down on how to use the new one.

A day or two later, I opened a package that was clearly sent through our online form (obvious because they had sent it using a FedEx label generated by the feature I had set up on the confirmation page of our form). I opened it up thinking that I would scan the barcode and be done with it, but no...

Inside, I found a copy of our old submission form along with the sample. Not sure what was going on, I used the FedEx tracking number to find the record of the submitted data and the barcode that should have been in the box (because of course I set it up so that all of this was available). 

When I pulled up the data they had submitted, it filled in all of the expected information, but in the patient history section (the part that usually requires the most work for the person doing the transcription, and therefore has the most room for error), it just said, ""See paper form included with sample.""

As far as I could tell, they probably filled out the form, needed a shipping label, and then called us. They went online and filled out the form, but they didn't feel like typing out everything they had just written down. So they made us do it instead. ",False,999,76,scienceboyroy,talesfromtechsupport

I ponder for a few moments as I picture what apocolyptic conditions at this store could have spawned this trouble ticket. And, how they would have the light status if the whole damn store exploded.

I see they provided an alternate phone # which must be someone's cell phone. The phone line must be down too.

Me: Hello, I'm ifix with ISP, investigating your service down, just have a couple questions.

C: Haha, yeah.

Me: so it says here, that your store exploded. 

C: Yeah sort of.

Me: Okay, can you clarify, are you still at the store?

C. Ya I'm here.

Me: Okay, so how much of the store is left?

C. Laughs uncontrollably and has to hold the phone away until he regains composure. ""Ya our water heater exploded and it set the whole telephone room on fire. The fire department just put it out.""

Me: Laugh uncontrollably and have to hold the phone away until I regain composure. Okay, I don't think we can do anything about that at the moment.

Customer calls in, heavy accent, so English isn't their native tongue. They need a software suite installed on their machine. No problem - I just need the inventory number off the computer so I can point the license at the right machine.

I ask her to give me the tag number (large silver sticker with a barcode). She asks where it's located. This depends on the machine - could be the back, could be the top, could be on the bottom if it's a laptop. Best way to figure that out is to see what kind of machine it is.

""I don't know - it's a computer.""

""It's a computer.""

""It's white?"" Yes she ended with a question mark. After telling her where to look, she still can't find the tag. Not on the back, nowhere else. I agree to come over.

""The basement""

Okay, at least that's next door. I go over. I go past the student consultant desk for their college and find 112. Nobody home. A girl from the tech desk runs out - I've found 112 adjacent. Why she told me 112 I have no idea. She shows me the computer. It's not white. Sort of the exact opposite. Black, if you will. A desktop from Texas with a name that ends in ""plex"".

342,"Yes, it IS as simple as *plugging it in*","So I work for a medium-small Federal agency that has a lot of roles, but mine specifically involves search and rescue. My day-to-day work involves supervising various operations from the comfort of a cold windowless room, but I also have a lot of information systems responsibilities at the local level, including project and program management.

My agency upgraded to Windows 10 about 6 months before this story begins. When that happened, my office went from users having four monitors (three at the desk and one on a giant ""wall of knowledge"") to two monitors- both on the desk. 

The initial reason for this was that we'd had non-standard graphics cards before: ATI FireMV something or other that had no drivers or generic driver support for Windows 10. Now we were left to whatever the onboard would enable us to have, which according to our local support was a grand total of two. 

I was pretty hands off for this whole process; between classes, other IT projects I was running, and college on the side, I just assumed our local support was fine and that obvious things were being checked.

As it becomes apparent that we can't get the old ones to ever work, one of my sort-of supervisors finds a newer GPU that's listed as approved hardware and requests one for installation. It doesn't work. To this day, nobody's sure why it doesn't work. That was a dead end. 

At this point, everyone just wants 3 monitors. Which nobody has even gotten that far.

Finally I have some free time to start pushing this with our configuration board and after talking to our local support about options we could only imagine, I got a weird itch in the back of my head. 

I walked around behind my workstation, took a look at the rats nest of cords (something like 2 display port, 2 VGA, and 2 DVI-D cords tangled together), figure out what's going where, and plug one in. I have three monitors.

Six months of work between our local support, our configuration board, and some IT minded workers and nobody had simply *plugged the dang monitor in.*

I think part of it was the heavy focus on four for so long that nobody just tried for three, but a lot of it was everyone overcomplicating the issue. ",False,575,41,arrrrik,talesfromtechsupport

For some context in education, local education that is departments like to go to conferences or get cold called on new and improved software to increase grades, graduation rates, or whatever. In turn they like to ram through a purchase without consultation then shove it off, usually to IT to make work.

***Backstory:*** This department in charge of increasing school work as it relates to graduation was approached by some company offering software that would be loaded on-prem but accessible through a portal both internally and externally. It promised alternate course work to meet minimum graduation work but in a more user interactive and one-on-one with small groups. Mind you this all happened about three years prior to this incident.

**Cast: $Me = Me, $DH = department head, $SG = server guy, $ITDir = IT Director**

Every two to three years the county would audit all purchases both for themselves, police/fire and school. Our year came up and the auditor shows up to comb through everything, the usual you both 500 computer where are they, you got this piece of equipment, blah blah, you bought this $100,000 software where is it loaded. Wait, what?

Auditor bring this back to the IT director, he in turns calls the server guys and tech in to figure out who bought what and where it went.

&gt;$DH - Yes, but it was IT who was supposed to set this up for us.  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - We only setup software we know about, if it was bought by another department without alerting IT we wouldn't know  
&gt;  
&gt;$DH - You should, IT maintains software, not us

This goes back and forth a little bit on who is responsible for what and when. Fast forwarding.

&gt;$ITDir - Here's what we will do. Send over all documents and contacts along with software links etc. and we will see what needs to be done to get this working  
&gt;  
&gt;$DH - School board wants it done before the end of the month.  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - Not going to happen, something like this that needs both an internal portal and external portal plus a client loaded on XYZ hundred number of computers will take several months providing we don't need to purchase any additional software/hardware.

Several days after this occurs the $ITDir pulls us back in to get the list of what needs to be done. We go through all the docs and info to find out it requires a IIS or Linux Web Server, SQL/mySQL and gigs of module downloads(extra cost of course) loaded on a content server all both internal and public facing.

It takes us about 4 - 4 1/2 months to get this ready and another several weeks of SCCM pushes to the several hundred machines for the client.

This is my first time posting a story here, so if I've made any mistakes, please be gentle! For this story, I will be $Argo and the lovely chap that I'll be talking to will be Mr. Not-An-Admin ($MNAA)

For a bit of background, I work on the support desk for an online SaaS system used by organisation HR. As such, this software will often contain sensitive information of staff members stored in its database. Our support desk only offers assistance to people who are confirmed as admins. Cue this ticket coming in:

$MNAA

&gt;Hi support  
&gt;  
&gt;My name is Mr. Not-An-Admin and I've recently taken over from Mr. Admin for \[CompanyName\].   
&gt;  
&gt;Please give my account full administrator permissions as I don't have them right now  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks, Mr. Not-An-Admin

The odd thing about this email is it actually came through from Mr. Admin's email account, but they pointed out straight away that they weren't Mr. Admin. Because of this, I knew I'd have to direct him to one of his in-organisation administrators, as having us give admin privileges to any random person who asked for it would be a GDPR nightmare.

$Argo

&gt;Hi $MNAA,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for getting in contact. Unfortunately, due to our policies on data handling, I am not allowed to change your permissions without explicit permission from one of your active administrators.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have reviewed your system and I can see that you currently have 3 active administrators, including the one who has left the company. Either of the 2 remaining admins should be able to get you sorted out with those permissions.  
&gt;  
&gt;If they are having any trouble setting your permissions, please ask them to get in touch and we will be happy to guide them.

All good, right? Wrong. Not even 10 minutes later.

$MNAA

&gt;Hi $Argo,  
&gt;  
&gt;I think you've misunderstood. I've taken over from Mr. Admin. I need you to give me the admin permissions. Please action ASAP  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Not-An-Admin

Once again, I go back to the client.

$Argo

&gt;Hi $MNAA  
&gt;  
&gt;I did understand the request, $MNAA, however it is not something that I can action. As you are only a regular user, I cannot change your permissions to an administrator. This is part of the data protection policies we have outlined internally. As mention previously, please speak to one of the 2 remaining, active administrators.

I really wish I could say this was the end of it, but it wasn't. Cue this follow-up email (again within 10 minutes)

$MNAA

&gt;$Argo.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is most unhelpful. If you cannot do it, please give me the password to an admin account that can and I will do it myself.

That's right. I'd told him I can't change his permissions because it would be a breach of data protection. Now he's coming back asking for an EVEN BIGGER breach of data protection. Needless to say, I was blown away by this request. To be honest, the passwords are encrypted, hashed and salted to Hell and back, so I couldn't give that out even if I wanted to. 

$Argo

&gt;Hi $MNAA,  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm afraid I can't do that. Providing you with the password for an account that has admin permissions would be a serious breach of our data protection policies.   
&gt;  
&gt;Please speak to one of your administrators personally. I have already established that your account is not an administrator and therefore I cannot offer further support.   
&gt;  
&gt;Apologies for the inconvenience,  
&gt;  
&gt;$Argo

FINALLY, he seems to get it. Although he does take one final shot at me in his final email.

$MNAA

&gt;$Argo.  
&gt;  
&gt;You have been most unhelpful. I will sort it myself.

Ticket closed. 

Sometimes I have to question the thought process that goes through these peoples' heads. Would they seriously expect me to turn on major system application permissions for some random Joe Bloggs who emails in asking for these additional permissions? 

**EDIT**: Thanks everyone for all the feedback! I honestly didn't expect this to start so many conversations. In response to those of you who suggested I follow up with their security officers, while I didn't do that and instead delegated the job of calling the client company regarding it to their account manager, I followed it up with the awesome chap who manages their account today and apparently he was meant to be an administrator and the admin who told him to email support thought using the admin email account to do this would be clearance enough.

All three of the times, I've asked her via email if she can show us the process they're using to get the problem she's seeing and have gotten zero response. Two of the times I tried to call and she was ""in a meeting but I'll leave her a message"". Again, zero response.

This last time, we get an email from our main contact over there asking why it hasn't been fixed yet. My response was exactly:

***We've logged in to her machine three times at this point and have been unable to reproduce it. We've asked \[owner\] if she could show us the problem happening but haven't gotten any kind of response about it.***

***When can we schedule time with \[owner\] for her to show us the problem in action since we can't seem to get it to do it?***

Again, radio silence. The next day, our operations manager comes into the bullpen and tells us that \[contact\] had emailed him (and followed with a phone call) complaining that my response was very rude and I had a ""not my fault attitude"".

Here's her email:

***I need to draw your attention to this email.

***\[owner\] is the owner of this company and has an incredibly full work schedule.

346,You smelled it?,"Long time reader, first time poster.

I work at a construction firm, and I'm the IT guy on-site. Most of the time, my job consists of watching Windows updates roll by on new systems that I'm setting up for users, with the occasional question from a co-worker on how to use the internet and so-on. Most of our issues are pretty tame, and simply come down to user error or user knowledge level. I don't get to diagnose much, but love diagnostics, especially on hardware.

$User: My computer made a click sound and suddenly shut off.

$Me: Let's go check it out.

We took a walk down to his desk, and the first thing I did was reach down to press the power button. I had an internal motherboard light on, could see that from the fan grill on the computer. That meant the computer had power. After pressing the power button, nothing happened.

The next thing I did was very strange to $User.

I unplugged everything from the back, picked the PC up, and smelled the power supply. I got a big ol' whif of that magic smoke we all know and love.

$Me: You need a power supply.

$User: You determined that from smelling it?

$Me: yep. I'll have you back up and running in ten minutes.

Then I went to the basement, grabbed a power supply out of some old stock, smacked that bad boy in, and the user had only spent 15 minutes total out of commission. I felt glad that my PC diagnostics and hardware knowledge finally came in handy. I even tore down the old power supply to show $User what went wrong (a mosfet and a couple resistors got too toasty).

348,A printer. It had to be a printer.,"I got a ticket near the end of the day, asking to install a printer on a computer. The branch in question was in a different time zone (I'm in  US-Pacific [GMT-07] and the computer was in US-Eastern [GMT-04]). I figured I wouldn't worry about it; after all, I had other tickets to work on that were much higher priority.

The next day I come into work and immediately get a message from one of my East Coast coworkers, telling me that this branch is calling and asking how the printer is coming. I told him to tell them I would call them a bit later. I do a couple of easy jobs and then begrudgingly call the branch. I listen to the phone tree that they have (which requires two button presses instead of one in order to speak with someone) and finally get in contact with a person... only to have the call disconnect.

I call back and ask for the person who called in the ticket and then followed up, who had apparently gone to lunch. I informed the person that I was just going to install the printer and it would be good to go. This would be fine... up until she mentioned she needed scanning functionality.

Now I wasn't sure if the driver we have in AD is set up with the scan functionality, so I said okay, but that meant I would have to get the driver from the website. The connection to our branches are about 1Mbps, so even downloading Java updates (60-ish MB) take about 5-10 minutes on a good day. The file for this printer was about 700MB (thanks HP). So I went and did other stuff while that downloaded.

I come back after it finished and started the install process. Right away it asks to re-seat the USB cable. So I call the branch. The call disconnects. I call again. It disconnects. I call one more time, and finally get the person who called the ticket in. I instruct him to re-seat the cable. He does. The driver starts doing its thing. I tell him I'll call back if I run into any issues and we hang up.

The driver goes through the install process for about 20 minutes, stops at 99%, then fails. I want to restart the computer, just in case there's a conflict somewhere,  but that would require calling the store again, so I put it off.

About an hour later I get a message from another East Coast coworker, telling me the branch is calling about the printer again. I was in the middle of another call and  said I would call back later. I do. It disconnects. I call again, and get the person who called the ticket in again. I tell him I want to restart the computer, but wasn't sure if it was okay. He checks with the people using it, who says it's okay, so I reboot. I hang up.

Once the computer comes back up I start the install process again. It asks to re-seat  the cable. Fuck. I don't want to call the store again, so I open notepad and say ""Please take out the printer's USB connection from the back of the computer.""

**Three. Fucking. People.** Saw it. They moved the window and one even tried to close it, but they didn't re-seat the cable. I opened another window, telling them to call me at my number. They didn't. I called them. Got disconnected. I called them again, finally got someone, told them to re-seat the printer cable again. They do, thank god.

I say thank you and hang up. Continue the installer. It stops at 99% again and fails. I reboot the computer; screw it, I'm just going to install the driver from Active Directory. Check Devices and Printers. It's installed successfully. Hallelujah!

I get the printer set up for the various programs they use and print a test page. I call them one last time; their phone system sounding like they were connected via an underwater line connected by tin cans. I get someone.

This isn't a story about how I solved a problem. This is a story about two men who grew up before civilian computers were a thing and only late in their lives started using them regularly.

First is my father. He's 60, for the next two months anyways, and he just... doesn't really find his way. I stopped explaining tabbed browsing to him because no matter what he will always open a window, type in the full address into the search bar, open the top link, and closes the browser to open it again for his next request. He'll always download sketchy software for his musical career that changes his home page to some sketchy ripoff search engine, and complain because his computer won't work... he also *never* reboots. If I borrow his laptop I just open it and Windows jumps into my face. He and my mom are complaining when I borrow their laptops and download *anything* at all because that 12MB Pdf file sure slows down your performance when it's sleeping there on your 600GB HDD... the more likely explanation is that your box is ten years old and overheats if you look at it funny. He once wondered why he couldn't access his work email from home (they never set up an environment for that) and both my parents insist on using webmail after I set up Thunderbird for both of them and explained it thoroughly.

An entirely different type is my grand-uncle (my maternal grandmother's brother). He's pushing 90 and didn't really use his machine until 4 years ago. For his 80th birthday we had broadband installed at his house (also an investment in the future, should he ever need a nurse a relative could move in with him without creating much stress for him). I explained Youtube and search engines to him, installed Thunderbird, explained that - and he actually uses it! He was a very quick learner too. And mind you, over the first two weeks I had to teach him double and right clicking.

I just found my observation interesting, but I guess it's easy to explain. My grand-uncle was first exposed to computers when access had already become incredibly easy. Everything is self-explanatory. My parents, and especially my dad, OTOH, had their first real contact in the late eighties/early nineties, that weird phase when computers became a consumer product but they hadn't wuite found their way yet.

Well, $Client has a bad habit of having three men being the ones to call in about issues or make tickets. These three men don’t like to talk to each other.

Since these three men all have ridiculously generic names, I’m calling them The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as they have been dubbed, in order of easiest to most difficult to work with.

The Father was the one to originally report the issue. I communicated with him on his ticket the whole way through, and thought that was that.

The Son called in about twenty minutes after we brought them back up demanding to know why there was downtime. We explained that The Father had reported the issue originally, and since it was critical, we had worked with him to get the issue fixed ASAP. He grumbles about how he wasn’t informed and that we need to reopen the ticket and CC him on an email to The Father so he has a record of what happened.

An hour after that, The Holy Spirit falls in. He’s notoriously short tempered and bad at explaining himself and tends to act condescending. None of this changed when he called in asking why no had informed him that there would be downtime. We told him there had been a case opened by the Father. He got angry that no one had CCed him on the email chain and demanded we send HIM an email off the case with all the details. 

Oh, and he also followed up with a bunch of bitching about how we need to be letting him and the rest of the organization know when there’s scheduled fixes.

Background: Among other things, I manage the email lists for our company ~2000 users, giving people the correct access/basic instruction as needed. I'm more of the back-end guy sitting in the IT dungeon, so I don't go off to people's desks very much, we have other guys on site to do that.


Anyways I've had a ticket sitting in my hopper since the beginning of this month in the ""Waiting for user to reply"" state. So I haven't touched it.


Today I decide to clean out some of my tickets and I see this one.

The ticket is requesting help to use the email list software. Understandable, it can be a bit of a learning curve sometimes.

My last comment on the ticket was 
&gt;Me: ""Here is a link for a guide on how to manage your email list. Let me know if you have any other questions or need more help. 
&gt;
&gt;link.to.internal.support.guide.com""

This support article gives the basic how-to's for administering an email list, fairly basic.

Since the ticket was over 2 weeks ago with no reply, I assume all is well for the user. So I close the ticket:
&gt;Me: ""I see you haven't replied Angry Lady (AL), so I assume you were able to figure things out. I will close this ticket now.""

And you'd think that would be it. But no, this is TFTS. 

A few hours later I receive an email with the following

&gt;Sergeant: You will NOT talk like that while I'm on the phone. Sit down and shut up.

This person is by far the most computer illiterate person I have ever come across in a professional environment.  I work in a law firm where, you'd assume that being in school for so many years, lawyers would have at least *some* basic computer knowledge.  Nope.  Nope nope nope.

This particular person wanted to swap their PC for a laptop (aka status symbol), which is fine, it's a personal choice, not a good one but whatever.  Ordered the hardware, got it configured up and shot an email to, let's call her Bambi.

&gt;**Email:**
""Hey Bambi, I've got your new laptop all ready to go, can you please let me know when a good time to install it would be?  To help avoid any work flow interruptions let me know when you'll be away from your desk for about 30 minutes.""

&gt;**Bambi:**  ""Ok, I'll try not to be busy then.""

Whatever, fine, we have a time, huzzah!  I gather up the hardware and waddle on over at 3 to see her fully immersed in like five word documents and some other research (I know, right, bet you didn't see that coming).  I asked her to please save and close her work so I can get down to business.  Immediately after asking her that she just pushed the power button on the computer.  Didn't save or close anything just ::boop:: power button.  Suppressing my rage I said,

&gt;**Me:**  ""Oh...please make sure you click the Windows button and then shut down.""

&gt;**Bambi:**  ""The what?  This is how I always shut down.""

&gt;**Me:**  ""Ah well, in the future, please don't do that.""

&gt;**Bambi:**  ""What is this force log off pop-up I always see, also I'm losing a lot of my work because it's not saving.""

&gt;**Me:**  ""It's because you pushed the power button and didn't save and close your work.""  (Sometimes I find it hard to say things without asking myself, ""Do I really have to say this out loud to another adult?"")

&gt;**Bambi:**  ""Well at the last place I worked it automatically saved everything I did.""

&gt;**Me:**  ::screaming in my head::  ""NO.  NO IT DIDN'T.""  ::out loud::  ""Oh, well, here you have to tell the computer you want to save.""

&gt;**Me:**  ""We don't have any cable boxes or anything, also if it's not business related I can't really spend time on that.  I only handle and install firm owned equipment.""

&gt;**Me:**  ""Well, no, it's not.  IT stands for Information Technology, which involves computers and data.""  (I for real said that, I'm not embellishing for the story)

Ticket comes in and the customer says she can't create a user profile, as the username is already taken, and she wants to know who's it it.

I write up a SQL query to give to her to make sure the username actually exists, and asks that her DB team runs it:

&gt;Cust: ""Oh we don't have a DB team. Can I do it?""

&gt;Me: ""Er, sure, if you have experience with SQL then by all means, I'm not in a position to tell you no.""

She returns an error and it was obvious she ran it in the wrong DB, and doesn't have experience with SQL, so I added a line to make sure it runs in the correct DB. She then sends a screenshot of the user, with his ID, termination date etc. as if looking for the next step.

I didn't know what else she wanted really, I figured the agent ID should be enough so I created another query to return the user's name. This is the conversation that followed:

&gt;Cust: ""And if it's the same name as the person I'm trying to import?""

**I started questioning what I know because the answer seems so obvious I start to believe I've forgotten something.* *

&gt;Me: ""Did you hire this person previously, or did you hire someone with the same name before?""

&gt;Cust, not even a minute later: ""This was a re-hire.""


So, she re-hired someone, created a new profile for them, with the same username, and when told the username was already in use, raised a ticket to find out who it belonged to......


She didn't even need to create a profile, she just needed to re-activate the old one:

&gt;Me: ""If this is a re-hire, then you can just reactivate their account by deleting the end date in their profile.""

&gt;Cust: ""It's already empty.""

She then sends a screenshot of the new account she was trying to import, not the original account.

Most of our users get to use 3-4 software solutions on a day-to-day basis, so when some of them calls, they will typically behave like this:

I got a heartfelt email from a lady whos dad passed away a long time ago. She recently discovered that there are some digital files of some black/white video taken many years ago that has her dad. She got the videos and was distraught that they wouldn't play. That was when she reached out to me and ask if I could recover the videos. 

I have very little experience in recovering corrupted video files, but I told her I'd give it a shot. Today, I got a thumb drive in my office that was wrapped in several layers of foam and all encased in a yellow envelope with the word ""FRAGILE"" written on it all over. Took a while, but I finally unwrapped it and it was the thumb drive.

 Plugged it in and checked it out and figured out that the problem was that the video files were a format that Windows Media Player can't read. I opened it in VLC and they all worked fine. 

I called her to let her know the videos are perfectly fine and that I'll be giving it back to her with a program that can run the videos the way they were when she sent it (VLC installation file) and with copies that will run the video on WMP. She was ecstatic.

 Right now, I've got all the videos rendering to mp4 in Adobe Media Encoder. Pretty soon, I'll give the thumb drive back to her and she'll finally get to see her dad again after all these years. 

She also said that she can't wait to show it to her family so they can see their brother, uncle, etc. again too.

The root cause of 99% of the calls I take are user error. To be fair, many of them are due to the user having to only perform a particular task maybe once every quarter or so. Why the instructions available for such processes are not read is anybody’s guess, but a good bit of my day is spent telling people “No, click that button and THEN that button.”

I received an email this morning that can best be described as a substantial amount of work disguised as a service call.

&gt;*We’ve got to move these materials from one plant to another, but I’m getting errors. Please let me know when these materials are moved.*

&gt;*Regards,*

I immediately noted that the error was not in any way described. Big German ERP System^TM has loads of error messages which are all coded for ease of reference. I replied, first of all, asking why I would be doing this task rather than just fixing the error that $LazyUser claims he is getting, and for him to give me the actual error, because you don't go to the doctor and not tell him or her why you're there.

I really try to refrain from copying direct managers on replies, but when people are trying to pass off work on people who have no business doing it, I think the manager needs to be aware that either the user is getting away with something or they cannot bring themselves to tell their manager that maybe they need help. Either way, it needs to be addressed.

376,Without operating system no working PC,"This is the first story I ever share and will propably be the last.  
I am working at a small company and I am not working for tech support I am a developer. But I am responsible for the sockets and for the moving and connecting of the devices.  
So I have a basic understanding how everything should be connected and what to check if some device is not working as intended.  
We have a seperate Laptop to scan all USB-drive that are from extern. The Laptop has all Anti Malware software on it and is pretty easy to use.  
There are 2 coworker who usually do the checking of these USB drives. But on that special day both were on vacation.  
So another coworker(C) of mine has to scan a USB drive for malware, because he needs the data on this drive today. To her luck there is a pretty good instruction on how to use this Laptop.  
The instruction is made for someone who has totaly NO tech-affinity. Here is what the instruction looked like(loosly translated from german):  
    The Laptop should be running. If not, power the laptop on. Check if the Laptop is plugged into a socket and the socket is on.  
    The LAN cable should be connected to the Laptop. If not connect it to the Laptop.  
    On the Desktop there is a file: Update Malware signatures. double click on that file.  
    Wait for the update to complete(it can take up to 30 min)  
    Open the Malware Scanner. {picture of the file}  
    Select your USB-drive and start the Scan.  
    That is it.  
So coworker just printed the Instruction and went to scan the USB drive for malware. After 40 minutes she comes back, and says the Laptop is not working as intended.  
I never worked with the Malware Scanner Laptop, but I still go with her to take a look at it.  
The Laptop is running, I can see the desktop but I can not access any folder or start anything.  
So I try to turn it off by holding the button for 3 seconds. The turning on did not went as good, the Screen showed the usual boot up screen for a second, but then the laptop turned off again.  
I wasted 30 minutes troubleshooting. I just want to give up, so I take the USB Drive that is lying next to the laptop to give it my coworker and tell her it is not working and she should write support (support can take from 30 minutes up to 3 days to come).  
But suprise suprise that is not her USB that she wanted to scan. That USB-drive was in the Laptop when she came, so she pulled that USB-Drive out and pluged her own in that slot. When she came to ask my help she had taken her USB-Drive with her.  
So in the end I learned that this USB-Drive that is always connected to the laptop has the main partition of the operating system on it. It is not labled and it looks just like the USB-Drives we give out to our externs.  
I labled the USB-Stick with ""Operating System"" and added to the instruction following line:

377,Absolute Certainty,"A national charity organization was moving out of our building and into a new building they had renovated.  They had asked me to assist with their technology needs with the move.  At the time, I was swamped and couldn't take on the project, so I referred them to an MSP I frequently work with.

Instead of going with my recommendations, they decided to go with a different MSP - one I would never recommend to anyone.  I will call them TMSP (Terrible MSP).

Fast forward.  Charity org is now in their new building.  They have everything setup for the most part, but are having a few issues with their new network that TMSP installed.  The printer company is there and for some reason they cannot get the scanner to email scans.  I was asked to investigate. I stated that TMSP and printer people needed to talk and that most-likely the issue lies within the firewall config.  Shortly thereafter, I get CC'd on an email chain from TMSP tech.  He states, and I quote, ""I can say with absolute certainty that we are not blocking ports 25 or 587 on the firewall/internet connection"".  Hmmm...

The director of the charity org is unsatisfied and wants me to figure it out.

Because I didn't have anything to do with the design or implementation of their network, I needed some information.  They had a new Watchguard firewall installed and some Ruckus APs.  I requested all of the necessary admin information for these devices from the director of the charity org.  She went back and forth with terrible MSP for a week before they begrudgingly provided the information to her (I should add that charity org is not paying a monthly service fee to TMSP to manage this device and they wholly own it).

I was at charity org on Monday and looked into why their scanner couldn't email scans.  I tried a few solutions from the device and nothing was working.  I decided to look in to the firewall.  I'm not a Watchguard guy and haven't had to look at a config for one in the last ten years, so I was a little nervous that I wouldn't be able to figure it out.  It took me all of five minutes to log in to the firewall and see that TMSP had created specific policies allowing outbound traffic on specific ports.  Ports 25 and 587 were not listed.  I created a simple policy allowing port 587 traffic and now the scanner can send emails.

378,It only took 15 years,"Warning, long post


So, my father in law is a lovely guy. Came from not a lot, worked extremely hard, and has become successful. This means that he has the money to buy nice tech toys, though he isn't so great at actually using them. I am not in IT, but am the de facto tier 0 tech support for these adventures.  


The problem is that he is a very bright guy. He's a family physician, but rather than make his money by charging high prices to rich people, his office is in the ghetto, his prices are the lowest in the island, and he works long hours, churning through huge numbers of incredibly loyal patients. He's nearly 70, and still works 6 days a week, starting at the crack of dawn. This means that he doesn't have the time to spend figuring technology out. He is prone to what I call quantum thinking; his brain processes all options simultaneously, so explaining stuff to him, and understanding what he has to say can be... difficult. I love him dearly, and we get on well socially, but he and I do not always work well together. I'm much more prone to systematically going through things and explaining them. He just thinks things should work. 


My first introduction to his love-hate relationship with technology came with the palm pilot, so that tells you how long we've been doing this dance. He decides he wants this new thing, even if he's not sure why. So, because it brings him joy, we get it for him, and spend Christmas putting all his contacts in, and setting it up. He is very pleased. 



He doesn't use it. 


Some weeks later, he picks it up, but the battery has died, and all his data is gone. He thinks batteries should last for months, not days, and, cursing, throws it back in the drawer, never to be used again.  


This is the start of a pattern repeats itself almost annually. Various Nokias, BlackBerries and others came and went. Each year he gets excited for the next new thing, and despite gentle reminders that he has no use for them, he insists that this gadget will be the game changer. He is a good guy, and gets really excited by all this, so we happily indulge him.


He does at least use the laptops that I set up for him, but it's never straightforward. He randomly assigns passwords for accounts, then promptly forgets them. I resorted to telling him to write them down; he's a doctor, so no-one can read them anyway. Not even him. Even if he could find the scrap of paper in amongst his stuffed filing cabinets.. 


Getting him to back stuff up doesn't work, so rather than lose all his reports, I set up Dropbox folders, and tell him to save them there. There are thousands of files, strewn in every corner of the computer. He'll spend a few months saving things in my docs, then switch to downloads, then the desktop, or wherever. To open a file, he opens word, selects the last doc, then saves a new copy. I've tried explaining the difference between programmes and folders, and how folders nest in one another, but I just can't get him to slow down sufficiently to listen to what I'm saying. Setting up templates didn't work either. I've had my wife try and explain, enlisted various techy family members, but no. IT support for him is a never ending cycle of firefighting.


Recently though, we had a breakthrough. This Christmas, he decides that the iPhone 10 would be the answer to all his problems. Dutifully, we got one for him (thank God his birthday is on boxing Day, and we can give joint presents), and I went about setting it up. After years of wrestling with stupid fucking iTunes for Windows for him, I wanted to get him on Spotify, so we can make playlists for his office etc. But when you live on a tiny irrelevant island, setting up spotify is not straightforward (for example, Google play has no payment processing here, so I can't even download apps with a paid component). Anyway, after a lot of jiggling around, we give him his functioning phone, expecting never to see it again. 


But then, something strange happened. He actually used it. He is sending WhatsApp messages, skyping his mother overseas, and actually taking the thing with him when he leaves the house! It's been a few months now, and it is still going. I am blown away by this. 


I just finished persuading him to get fibre installed so he can watch Netflix. He is  of course very excited by, and grateful for, this. And for the first time, I'm excited too. I really don't want to have to go back to torrenting all his favourite shows, and taking them down there on a memory stick that he will promptly lose…


Wish me luck.

380,A gaming laptop for a client,"A woman calls my shop, says she bought a laptop for her son so he can play his favorite game, and make videos recording himself play like his favorite youtubers. Working together, her and her son managed to get Steam installed but failed to install his favorite game. After several simple questions back and forth she revealed the laptop to be a Macbook Air.


Pause for sigh.


I calmly explain to her that Apple computers aren't gaming computers, and many games simply cannot be installed on them. She asked what her options were, and I told her the most cost effective solution would be to throw together a basic PC with a half-decent GPU, and it would be a great gaming computer for his favorite game. The kid demands to have a laptop instead of a desktop, so together we decided that returning the macbook and getting a similarly priced non-apple laptop will be more than enough for his not-very-demanding game. She thanks me for my assistance.


A week goes by and she shows up at my shop with her son (who I now realize is barely 10 years old) in tow. She places a Macbook Air on my counter, and explains that she tried to take the macbook back and get something for gaming, but her son had an otherworldly tantrum and absolutely demanded to keep the macbook. She spent days reading and tinkering and to her credit, installed bootcamp and had Windows 10 running natively, but now she is out of her element and can't figure out how to install programs in a Windows environment. I accept the job and install Steam and Ultimate Custom Night. (i know, i know..)


Another week goes by and she comes back with a laundry list of complaints. The game, and any other game he tries, run poorly. Screen recording programs don't work properly.

382,I'm supposed to know what now?,"Background: I'm the IT manager (read: only IT guy) at a certain multi-specialty medical practice. Very stressful, but I love the owners and most of the docs. Plus I've known the owners since I was a kid, and they specifically invited me to do the job once I proved I knew what I was doing and they realized they needed a full time IT guy.

Characters:

$me: well if this ain't me, I should be in a hospital, not working at one.

$doc: a doc who, while generally a nice person, is also a perfectionist that runs their own department with an iron fist

$HRlady: the lady that does all our recruiting and is usually swamped because of our high turnover

In a similar vein to a story I read here a few months ago, this morning I received a series of messages from one of the physicians in the medical center I work in regarding the fact that their new girl manning the front desk in their department hasn't had her account set up and thus can't work. New girl also can't get to her desk because she couldn't open the door. This second part was apparently my problem because I'm apparently responsible for getting the staff their door codes (I'm not, and never have been. We have a guy who does that as one of the many hats he wears. He's been doing that for a couple of years now, though everyone in the building thinks I do it, despite it being clearly stated multiple times that I don't.).

About 30 seconds prior to the wave of texts, I also got a call from one of the office managers warning me what was coming, as she'd just gotten off the phone with the understandably pissed off doctor. Turns out the girl couldn't open the door because she couldn't figure out that it was a sliding door, though to be fair, it was her first day, and we have exactly 2 sliding doors in the whole building.

Now, I'm generally somewhat swamped, being the only IT and all, so I figured ""Oh shit...I forgot there's a new girl coming in."" I check my ticketing system, and there's indeed a ticket for a new account. Usually, I create these during the day, or if marked urgent, early in the AM from my house. Except that the note inside is for a totally different person, assigned to a totally different department. So I call the doc.

$me: ""hey $doc. So I never got a ticket with your new girl's name, or when she's starting. Any idea why?""

$doc: ""BLAH BLAH BLAH $HRlady. BLAH BLAH SPOKE TO YOU YESTERDAY. I BLAH SPOKE TO YOU ON BLAH. BLAH BLAH BLAH NOT DONE."" (I feel I should mention $doc is a relation of one of the owners, and has also known me since I was a kid. In fact, I've been their patient, so they yelled but didn't curse. They're generally very nice and courteous to me, and the $doc in our conversations stands for %doc's first name, not doctor.)

$me: ""Indeed, HR did speak to me yesterday. And did mention a new girl. But not for your department. And you asked me to go introduce myself to your new trainees when I came to make sure your department didn't need anything from me that I didn't know about, not that you were hiring them.""

$doc: ""NO. I JUST SPOKE TO HR. THEY SAY THEY SENT YOU THE TICKET. YOU KNEW ABOUT IT. DO THIS NOW. WE ARE GONNA BE BEHIND THE WHOLE DAY NOW. AHHHH.""

$me: ""Ok, yeah. I'll take care of it.""

I hang up, and check the ticketing system again. Confirm everything's been working fine for the last 72 hours. Call HR.

$me: ""$HRlady, did you send me a ticket for the new girl last night?""

$HRlady: ""Yeah. I got done with her around 5ish, right before you left. Told you to set her up for tommorow.""

$me: ""Yeah I remember that convo, and that ticket, but that was for $otherdepartment, not $doc's department, no?.""

$HRlady: ""Wait, what? Hold up."" *10 seconds later* ""Oh...shit. I sent only the one, not two. Ok, here's her name. I'm sending the documentation now. Get it done.""

$me: ""Ok, sure. It needs to be done stat according to $doc."" *create the account, show the girl how to log in and such*

10 minutes later, I get a call from $doc

$doc: *really contritely* ""mf9769? I just want to apologize for yelling at you. Didn't realize it wasn't your fault, and we had a crazy morning. Sorry. I spoke to $HRlady and clarified everything.""

$me: ""Shit happens, $doc. Just remember, if it's not in the system, I don't know about it, ok?""

$doc: ""Yeah. Sorry.""

383,I want to edit on Excel these receipts I printed.,"LTL, FTP. My dad runs a small business and I'm home from college due to summer vacations (not in the US) so my dad has me close to help him with work. 

This morning he asked me to make a receipt for him on Excel, so he could just tap some numbers and get the total with taxes automatically. No problem, just make some tables and add simple formulas.

I showed him later that day the receipt. He was happy at first, until he told me that he had already printed a bunch of those at a nearby store. What he wanted was to be able to edit the receipts on Excel then print them on the paper he already had, meaning that the values on Excel would have to fit on the preprint. I was annoyed as first that I hadn't understood what he wanted the first time but I told him that that should be easy with the original file. No need to deal with measurements or such.

Of course, he didn't have it, he wanted me to make the receipt anew and for it to fit on his papers. There went my afternoon measuring cells and trying to make them match with those bloody receipts.

384,Grocery store IT short stories,"Moar IT stories!

I formerly worked for a small company that provides tech support to other companies.  These stories are all about 1 particular client, a local small chain of grocerry stores here.  Nice company, but most of their issues can be summed up to:

Story 1

Client: ""Thing is broken; please fix""
Us: ""Okay, we $$$ to buy a new X""
Client: ""Oh, nevermind then.""

Perhaps best example, near the end of me working with them, I checked our reports to find the oldest, must replace computers, and IDed 2 desktops, both 5 years old, and 1 of them making a worrying noise (I think it was a fan).  The client verbally and enthusiastically agreed to replace them soon.  That computer with the worrying noise died a week later, but the client only replaced that and not the other computer I showed them. /facepalm

------

Story 2

The cheapness issue also extended to billing.  They paid $X amount each month per computer (although our boss did all kinds of excepts, grumble).  At the time, we had shitty remote management software, so I kept a spreadsheet of each computer, by name and location (even room).  I tell the client they this many computers and they argued that, no, they had fewer commputers.  SO I showed them the spreadsheet to see how I came to my total and finally they agreed.  The next month they did the same thing.  It took half a year before they stopped complaining they had fewer computers (or at least that I heard).

------

Story 3

A non-cheapness issue! This is a network setup that is a bit difficult to explain: client has several locations along 1 city block, but they all operate off the ISP from the main building, which uses 2 way attennae to send internet to the other locations on the same block (the other sites farther away do have their own internet).  Apparently these are meant to be used to send data a mile away, not half a city block, but the sub-locations get much slower speeds that the main location, even though we did about as much as we could to improve speeds.

Did I mention the marketing dept was on one of the sub-locations?  Well they were, and if you dont know, marketing uses HUGE raw files for pictures and videos.  They frequently complained it would take a long time to download or upload those files from the server.  However, they also always had Spotify running.  No amount of explaining that Spotify was gravely impacting their network speeds would get them to stop using it; eventually the marketing dept moved to a new location with their own internet and the new dept that moved in had no network speed complaints.

-----

Story 4 

The main location has (had? I don't believe they would spend money to replace it) this OLD camera system.  It crashed often, but it was an easy fix: reseat the HDD.  The problem is that the ""room"" it was in is above the bathroom.  This requires obtained a ladder (easy enough), climbing the ladder into this spider-infested nook, then while Im doing my repairs (hunched over, btw), someone has to take the ladder away cuz it's blocking the path.  After I am done, I have to wait until I can flag down an employee to bring me back the ladder, which can take a few minutes (there may or may not be some footage of me making faces into a camera while waiting).  *Fuck that.*

So we tried to get the manufacturer to repair the system, however since it was an old system, out of any kind of warranty, and not even in production anymore, it would take like 3 weeks and some $3,000 to fix.  Client refused.  However we were able to convice the client to get a replacement HDD for the system and thankfully that cut down me having to climb up into the spider-nook from once a month to once a year.

------

Story 5

Client at the time had their own email servers (I think they were the last to move over to something like Office365), which frequently had issues, included space.  Client had a media out-reach program promoting their store as a top 500.  They even included that article and award as part of their email signatures.  However, client failed to mention that to us.  The ensuing flood of email filled the servers resulted in email outage for a few hours.

------

Story 6

Naming conventions.  So, this client likes to have everyone's email address be their first name.  Yeah, that frequently became an issue, so the ""policy"" was if that name was already taken, the user's email is their first name and last initial, no space or break.  This first became an issue when a new hire ""Chris T"" would have had the email christ@company.com.  

Amazingly, that didnt change the policy, but the next time a new hire, ""Joe L"" would be joel@company.com, and they realized it would be confusing for people to think he was Joel.

Before that policy change, 1 guy with a common name chose to have an animal for his email (eg, dolphin@company.com).

------

Story 7

Not really an IT story, but good enough for an ending.  Even though I had my own laptop, I frequently used their desktops, even to write emails.  Client also has a small bee farm on the roof of the main location, and since no AC, they open the windows when it is hot.  Also, I am highly alergic to bee stings.  

On this day, I was on one of their desktops, writing an email to the client basically about what I did that day, when a bees lands on my desk, near the keyboard.  I internally flip the fuck out, yet my arms remained calm.  I knew I had to get the email out, but rather than leave and retype it at home (seriously, end of day, dont wanna work!), I stopped what I was writting mid email and instead wrote

**""Oh shit bees! Im out""**

4. Then call tech support to get help.

387,The Tale of the Battery Packages,"First time posting here, and boy do I have some fun ones in my back pocket, but I'll save those for another time.  For now, we're going to discuss the reason I finally decided to post.

Come on in folks, and sit down for the saga of the Battery Packages.

Some background:  I'm a ""Tech Generalist"" (my job title is ""Technician"", which I was, once...) who works for an independent religious school somewhere in the United States.  My school is named after a saint, as a fair few of them tend to be.  This is important later.

One day, my school gets three packages of batteries from $Manufacturer, totaling 120 batteries.  This piques my interest since while we do have $Manufacturer's laptops at our school, we didn't order any batteries and we don't have any set of 120 computers in any case.  So I email the rep, asking WTF? Their reply was ""Here's the email of the lady who ordered them.  Are they not a part of your organization?""  Her email address had a different domain than ours, and it belongs to a rather similarly named (same saint) school in $OtherState, though it's probably only a couple hours worth of driving from our location.  So I point this out.  A few days later, another message.  ""Oh, they're a different school than you.  Can you send the packages to them if I give you prepaid labels?""  Being a nice enough person, I say sure - it gives the interns experience with mailing and packages.  So we get the labels, I check them for accuracy (they are), and the interns drop them off at the pack and ship place, and since it's prepaid that's all they need to do.  Today, I get... three boxes of batteries with a $OtherState address on the shipping label.  WTF?  


Edit: It looks like not all the old labels were blacked out (like they usually are on incoming packages - this must have been because of the odd nature of the packages to begin with) when I had my interns attach the new ones.  \*Sigh\* I feel dumb now.

388,I need ALL the information,"So, this is my first post so I'm sorry for the formatting, also, I'm not a native english speaker, so there will be some ortography/grammar errors.



My work it’s a jack of all trades, it involves project management, system analysis, implementation, software testing, a little (almost inexistent) software development, and tech support of all the systems that I implement, one of them is responsible to integrate three other systems, this story it’s related with the development team of one of these I’ll call it **CCS** from customer care system.



One day I was in a 5 hrs travel to make an implementation in one of our call centers, the problem was, that I had some integration tests scheduled with the CCS team, so, we had to postpone them, next day, I was supporting remotely



**CCS Guy**: *Your system it’s not working.*

**Me**: *Have you erased the browser’s cache?*

**CCS Guy**: *Yes, still not working.*

**Me**: *Ok then it must be another thing please try again open the browser's console and tell me what error returns.*



Well, I’m going to do a parenthesis here, the test that we were doing consisted in sending data to a third system, which it’s sent via webservices, we have two of them but for test purposes I’ve only configured one, so it was sending an OK message and one with an error which was correct. End of parenthesis.



**CCS Guy**: *It’s sending an error from the webservice*

**Me**: *That error it’s correct, that’s not the problem, can you send me all the text in the console so I can find the error*

**CCS Guy**: *Ok, sending* Then he proceeded to send me a photo of the console showing the aforementioned error

**Me**: *Nope, that’s the same error you mentioned, I need ALL the text in the console* 

**CCS Guy**: *Ok* He sent me a photo of the error that my system was showing (the same message)

**Me**: *No, as I said before, that error it’s normal I NEED ALL THE TEXT your console it’s showing* 



After a frustrating half hour with this, the scheduled time for the tests was over so I asked them to send me the data of the browser’s console and the logs located in X folder in their PC so I could analyze it and help them with the error, and I received an email from them with the same photos they already sent me. After that, I found a configuration made by me that was the problem and solved it.



But that’s not all, before my correction, the CCS team leader went to complain with my director of me not being in the tests (remember, I was 5 hours of distance), well, he had the right to do it and there were nobody else to help him, so I’m not going to blame him for doing it, but, I don’t know what he said but whatever it was, instead of saying something like “Hey, Ecurat is not helping us please assign us someone who can”, he told something my director understood that I had done modifications in production environment (totally not true), so I spent the rest of the day explaining to him that the configurations were in a development environment.



Later my director scolded the CSS team leader, so I hope he thinks twice before going to complain something with him (or at least think twice what’s going to say).



TL;DR – I couldn’t go to do some tests with another team, the system I do support fails (my fault), guy can’t understand that I need ALL the information he could collect, his leader complains about me, my director misunderstand him and believes I’m making configurations where I should not, I explain that he’s wrong and the leader gots scolded.

I remote in and find she is accessing our webmail instead of using Outlook. (Which she has both emails setup on).  Company A’s webmail is blue and company b is yellow.  It’s a wonderful aaaaha moment for me, as I’ve never paid much attention before.

M: It looks like you’re accessing the webmail for company A, which the credentials you’re entering are incorrect.  

C: I’m entering the correct ones.  See watch.

M: I’m afraid you’re using the credentials for company b, which won’t work.  Try again using company a’s credentials, the same ones you’ve used to log in to the PC with.

C: Oh it worked!

M: Great!!! You do know you’re setup on Outlook with both and an icon is placed on your desktop.

C:Yes I just prefer this way better.

She was sure it was a practical joke at her expense. Our supervisor ended up opening her browsing history and showing her by going to the site how easy it was to just pickup the adware.

I have at least some level of involvement in probably 80% of our projects, so if someone is stuck I’m probably a good person to ask. 

One of those projects is deploying new networking gear to every office, gear whose name rhymes with “her hockey.” This gear is generally pretty plug-and-play, but once in a while an oddity occurs as it did one day to $RegionalTechFieldManager (henceforth aliased as $RTFM).

$RTFM: hey $huta, I just finished installing $herHockey at this new office, but one of the PCs is still getting the old IP scheme. It’s definitely set dynamically, and I’ve renewed the IP and flushed DNS and still nothing. This doesn’t seem possible. What do?

$huta: hm. Well usually that means there’s still a DHCP server on the network somewhere. What’s the gateway?

$RTFM: it’s bla.bla.bla.115, which also makes no sense. It should be bla.bla.bla.1!

$huta: well check the $herHockey dashboard, and see what device has that IP. Most likely there’s a rogue router somewhere. 

$RTFM: huh... that IP is for the $BittneyPowes stamp machine. That's impossible, it’s not a router!

$huta: well, try logging into the Web interface to see what’s up. 

$RTFM: oh my... oh, geez. It appears this $BittneyPowes device has a server mode, presumably so you can connect it via Ethernet directly to a PC to add more money. I guess someone enabled it, forgot about it, and connected it to the network. I’m disabling it now. Thanks $huta!

394,"First post, and I can’t think of a good title","I work in tech support for a company that involves me talking to everyone from vendors to shops to ITs to huge corporate companies, depending on the need. While our product is kind of a niche and we don’t have a large support team, I’m cross-trained in about 12 different applications, so my calls/emails/chats can vary greatly on a case-by-case basis. 

Today, a shop chatted in saying they had sent an order to the wrong vendor and needed to resend it to the correct one. S will be for the shop, M will be for me. 

S: “I sent this order to the wrong vendor and need to resend it to “x vendor instead”. 

M: “Sure, are you on your “orders” tab, and do you see that order listed? If you just sent it, it should be right at the top.”

S: “No, it’s not there.”

M: “Did you delete the order after you sent it to the wrong vendor?”

S: “No, I didn’t delete it, I just sent it to the wrong one.”

M: “Are you sure? If you just sent it, it would be at the top of the list and you could open it back up and resend it, but if you deleted it, it’s gone unless you re-do the order in your “outside system” and pull it back into the website.” 

(Our system has a small program which is locally installed, that exports files into a website, if the order has been deleted it can’t pull that file back in because it registers it as having been obviously “sent before”.)

S: “I can’t re-do it, because it’s been “locked” in my system. I did remove “x” as a vendor though, and now the order is gone, can’t you resend it for me?”

(They can re-do them even if they’ve been locked, it’s a simple matter of copying the info and starting a new file and pasting it all in there.)

M: “Are you sure you didn’t delete the full order, not the vendor? Because it sounds like you deleted the order you sent to the wrong vendor.”

S: “No I did not delete the order, can’t you just login and look at my account?”

I login to their account and confirm that they did delete the order, as the vendor was still showing up in their vendor list. 

M: “The vendor is still showing up in your vendor list, and the order is missing from your orders tab, so you did delete the full order.”

S: *immediately disconnects*

Usually, these shops give me pushback and swear up and down that they never deleted the order. In the two years I’ve been doing this, the system has never found a way to delete orders. If anything, orders have gotten stuck and you can’t delete them at times.  

I know this wasn’t the most funny or entertaining story, but aside from thinking of when I got verbally berated by an IT with a chip on their shoulder, or having someone yell at me because a server went down and they wanted me to turn it back on, this was the one that came to mind.

TLDR: Bored person has fun. 

At my prior employer, after we had been bought out a couple of times, the great minds that be decided that every server needed to follow new naming conventions instead of the whimsical names that devs like to give things. *nix boxen get a U for Unix, P for Production, and then a 3-digit number. Our two primary processing servers became UP104 and UP106.

I'm one of the smart-asses in the company and had already posted signs on the bathroom stalls for ""Employee Breakroom"" (the small crapper) and ""Executive Breakroom"" (the handicap crapper - that sign mysteriously disappeared after a week or two). Well, having a label maker handy, I decided that the urinals needed to be named - UP104 and UP106.

10 years later, after we'd all been laid off and another company was occupying our former stomping grounds, I heard from a guy who worked there and knew the history, that they would call building maintenance and tell them that UP104 wasn't flushing right (or whatever the issue was).

So, I work for a webhosting company that supports, for the most part, small and medium sized businesses. As such, we get a lot of people that are kind of new to the whole web developing thing, and while that's usually awesome sometimes it's just silly. Example.   


A woman calls in saying she's received a notification on her account that Internet Explorer does not work very well with our software, and because she's using it, she needs to switch to Chrome or Firefox. So, she admits she's quite computer illiterate and doesn't know how to download and install chrome.   


I send her an email with the download link, and tell her to follow the instructions. Apparently I was not clear enough after telling her to click on the downloaded file. (Admittedly I said ""Yep, now you just click on it!"" in regards to running the installation)  


She tells me she did everything, and we decide to try logging in. She forgets her password. We go through resetting it. She forgets it again. She then logs in.   


""I'm still getting the same message"" and she reads it exactly as it appears - Now, I'm pretty sure she's still on IE at this point. I try to start a screen share session, but the software is busted on my PC at the moment because of an issue with logins to it that was supposed to have been resolved a week prior. Problem for another day, I shrug it off and decide at this point I've gotta teach this lady how to do a screenshot.   
This process takes about 20 minutes , but she seems to figure it out with some guidance.

I explain pressing CTRL + V to paste the prtscn picture into her email. 

I then receive an email that just says ""V""

Ok, round two. This time, I get a picture of her email box. Deciding this isn't working, I tell her ""I think you might still be in Internet Explorer.. did you double click the file you downloaded earlier and install it?""

400,Windows 10 upgrade woes,"So we're currently doing a rollout of Windows 10 since Windows 7 is reaching its end of life. We normally schedule a time convenient for the user as it can take half a day since it's mostly done with SCCM through a network cable, even with a gigabit backbone as the upgrade process actually involves reimaging the device with Windows 10 and any required drivers, depending on whether it's a laptop or desktop.  

But we can't just go upgrading people's machines without backing up their stuff first, so my supervisor had a nifty little script he's been using for the past ten years to back up everything under the user's profile folder, as well as non-system files that may get saved outside of their user profile folder i.e. under the C drive but not inside C:\Users\Username. Anything that got saved outside the user's folder depended on the file extension, so that for example a whole bunch of .ini files from some random program wouldn't get unneccesarily copied.  

Most people don't have an issue outside of not being sure where some of their files were at first, but so far there's been two rather outstanding cases.  

The first one was a guy who had MS Access databases saved outside of his user profile folder, under C:\ and the backup script unfortunately didn't pick it up since out of the several hundred people in the offices at this particular location, only him and one other guy were known to have Access databases stored outside their profile folder, and so my supervisor's script didn't account for MS Access 2007 database files (.accdb), only pre-2007 databases (.mdb files). It sucked for everyone but after taking a look at the backup on the external HDD we save it to, and concluding that the files were lost, we got into a little argument, now I've never been good with confrontations but one thing I distinctly remember was his manager sitting next to him telling us that 'we don't back up our data, you guys do,' (we only routinely back up stuff on the servers) and when I asked him what if something happens between these backups, he replied that he didn't back up his data because nothing has happened to it yet. I was considering asking if he buys insurance before or after his house gets broken into but again, I'm not good with confrontations and so I just told him that we only back up data on our servers, and that we'd see if we can get the data off the drive.  

He and his manager kept rather quiet though when they and I, my coworker, supervisor, supervisor's manager all got into a little office to talk about this incident...strangely not mentioning how we back up their data and not the users...my supervisor was having a go at them saying that they shouldn't save stuff on the C drive and that he'd been using that backup script for the past ten years without issues, as well as pointing out how nobody else at this location had database files stored outside their user profile folder. We eventually came to a compromise, my supervisor's manager (he's more manager rather than IT oriented) saying that we should probably slow things down a bit so that this sort of thing wouldn't happen again and that was that. The user sometimes makes light remarks about the thing but I just roll my eyes remembering what his manager said about backups...sheesh.  
_______________________
And as for the second story...well this particular manager was saving his stuff normally, and after his laptop got upgraded he realised the contents of his Documents folder were missing. We got an email from him last week saying that he had missing files under my Documents and was wondering if we could retrieve them. The strange thing is that my coworker had upgraded his laptop *months* ago and he only emailed us last week about there being nothing in the Documents folder. My coworker was absolutely perplexed as to how this could be the case (his prior job was call center work, not so much software and hardware support with desktops and laptops) and told me what was happening. So I popped in the external HDD into my computer to take a look at his profile folder, see that there's absolutely nothing under Documents, save for Outlook's folder and one or two other automatically generated folders. This was pretty weird, since his Desktop folder was full of stuff. But then I saw it. A shortcut.  

But not just any shortcut, it was a shortcut to My Documents. I right clicked on it and checked out the properties...ooooooh boy. The shortcut's target was to C:\Users\\**Public**\My Documents, but the guy had no clue...all this time and for god knows how long, he was saving to the Public profile folder which didn't get copied over for obvious reasons. I don't even know how but that shortcut was there alright. Maybe one of the guys at the other offices set it up since the guy does move around a bit but he seemed accepting of it as we didn't hear back from him after my coworker talked to him over the phone recently.  

Other than those two though, people seem ok with the upgrade, some of them grumble about Windows 10 though as they understandably disliked Win 10 to begin with but it's what upper management wants so what can we do.",False,77,26,edbods,talesfromtechsupport

Now, by our norm, this was a *monumental* list of terminations. We're normally supposed to follow a procedure where we individually remove email group access, disable accounts and move their active directory profiles to designated disabled users folders, etc. so this would amount to a lot of hours on one ticket. Another engineer and I were quite hesitant to touch this without confirming with $XYZ-ITDirector if he was sure he wants to do it. We called him and he confirmed.

Regardless of how unusual and destructive the request seemed, the other engineer and I got to work disabling accounts en masse upon getting the go ahead. 4pm rolled around and we had gotten about 35-40&amp;#37; into the list, so we went home for the day, to continue on Monday.

Little did we know until this morning, is that there was a call at around 4:30pm from none other than $XYZ-ITDirector, saying that there were several names on the list that shouldn't have been there, and that we were going to need to restore those profiles. The on-call engineers updated us on the situation after having had to take ownership of the ticket over the weekend. 

Apparently, we had given a script to $XYZ-ITDirector that reports back with a list of users that haven't logged in via RDS in a given period of time; in this case, 90 days. He'd likely thought nothing of just terminating those users; just some upkeep, right? Well, as it turns out, lots of employees login via active directory without necessarily going in through RDS, meaning that we were disabling users that were actively working for $XYZ, just not through RDS. What's worse is that $XYZ has active directory sync with O365, meaning they had their email access suddenly revoked after the terminations too.

So one of our backup engineers is running a restore on their domain controller. I'd love to be a fly in the wall in the meeting room where $MSP's account manager for $XYZ has to explain to $XYZ why all of this is going to be billable because $XYZ-ITDirector thought it'd be a good idea to wipe 150+ profiles without doing even a little bit of looking into it first.

TL;DR: IT director of a client company decides to get us to terminate 150ish users that haven't logged in specifically via RDS in 90 days, doesn't entertain the idea that users may not necessarily get in through RDS. Chaos ensues.",False,94,8,Nardrummer,talesfromtechsupport

I swing out fire it up, to see if it might be a quick onsite fix, no such luck, hangs after bios bit never displays windows. Ok might be hdd or any of the other classic culprits (cough cough viruses).

So I take the tower back to the shop, hook it up, hit the power button and it fires up windows like a champ!

Weird but not that weird, so I shut it down and check/reseat all the cable connections and fire it up. It works perfectly.

So as not to have to come back out again I also run a full HDD and  then a mem test over night.

I come back in the am to see the mem well over 5 passes and no errors, so I load the tower back up, take it back and get it setup, hit the power button and the same issue occurs. 

WTF?!? I must have started and shut it down 10 times while it was in the shop with no issue what so ever!

So I apologize and take it back to the shop again and it works great.

412,"No thanks, I don't want the credit","First time posting here, and I'm on mobile, so sorry for lack of formatting.

I'm a software dev in a department of a dozen. 
We are split up into multiple app teams. One team is Support and they just do tier 2 stuff. There are two of them. (Tier 1 is someone in a call center with some reference articles and scripts about frequent easy (user training) issues.)
I'm on an app team and the expert on this app. I've written tons of documentation, though, to help everyone from QA to new devs to Support.

An important point here is that Support is made up of two devs. (The Support assignment rotates every 6 months or so, though not through everyone.)

S will be the support gal in this story.
NT comes up later. He is a non-technical person on our T2 team. He is supposed to handle user training issues.
user is the user.

S sends me an email asking me to look at an incident. Within 1 minute of starting to read it is obvious this is a user training issue. The user sees items on a dashboard that he feels shouldn't be there. They are there because nobody in the company took action on them (they aren't Approved). That is the designed behavior. If he wants them to disappear, he has to take action. There is a slight snag, but we'll get to that. 

S forwarded me the issue assuming the application was misbehaving and asks me to look at it. The user has included a list of 17 items he didn't want to see anymore. S is a dev. She had full access to everything. Within minutes she could have looked up the database query that populates the dashboard and verified the WHERE conditions against the data for one of the items, but she did none of this. And damn, this is becoming her pattern, not even spending a minute on something before escalating to me.

Stage 1 is realizing the items in the dashboard is valid.

The user stated that he wanted to Archive the items, but that action is only possible on items that have worked their way through the company and are in a Approved/Complete status. These pets, however, should be Rejected. He can't Archive because that action can only be taken on a screen that shows Approved items.

S DID know that Archive is only available in the Approved screen but doesn't know why the 17 items aren't showing up there but on the not-approved dashboard. Cue banging head on desk. S didn't think it was because they WEREN'T Approved?

So user and S need reminding on what Approved means and what Reject is.

Stage 2 is that I realized that these items couldn't be Rejected easily even if the user wanted to because someone had soft deleted parent data (clusterf*ck; this had to be a direct db edit since the app requires all child items resolved before soft deleting parents; I'm gong to blame Support for this too, but I'll check the logs later). So he'd have to search for them on a separate screen with an option checked to show soft deletes. [I realize at this point the app sounds like a labyrinth. It's because I'm complicating it by simplifying it to protect anonymity.] I don't fault user or S for this. I type up detailed instructions on how to Reject these items with annotated screenshots (4 steps).

I send these steps and screenshots in the body of an email to S. I copy the text only and paste it into work notes in our incident system.

2 hours later I get an IM from NT (non technical guy on T2 team) asking me what the steps to fix this are. Me: ?
NT is at the user's desk and the user received a msg from S saying to follow my fix steps.

It turned out that S didn't notice that I put the steps into the work notes (not visible to end users). Also, S didn't seem to care that those steps left out the screenshots I so carefully prepared. I also notice S didn't close the ticket and had assigned it to me!

Instead of dealing with S again, I make a PDF with the steps and screenshots and attach it to the ticket, visible to the user. I message NT the all clear.

I ask S about it and she said she didn't realize it was work notes (didn't mention lack of screenshots). She said she assigned the ticket to me so I get the credit but didn't close out because she wanted to hear back from the user. (Correct procedure is close the ticket with resolution steps or notification that issue is fixed, users have three days to reopen.)

I take a quick look through the ticket log. I notice she and the other support person often ask for more info from the user before continuing to troubleshoot then just close the ticket after a few days. They don't seem to realize that they are asking these questions IN THE INTERNAL WORK NOTES even though work notes are ORANGE. The two text input boxes for notes and internal work notes are vertically stacked on the page, but the work notes box IS ORANGE with a bold red statement that says ""not visible to the user."" I point this out to her and it blows her mind. These try have been on support for a month. Flying spaghetti monster help us.

I tell her to reassign it back to her because I don't want the credit.

413,He even stole my girlfriend man!,"So this from a few years back when I was working in a very large company's tech support department. We mostly worked with small - medium sized business owners and administrators who used our cloud based products.

So this was twords the end of my time in this place so by this time I was very good at my job and would often get cases that had gone through a few other agents. This was one of those cases. 

My main speciality was migrations and this was a migration cases but 1 of the previous agents was an email agent so they dealt with a person who had no real tech skills beyond that of an average user for at least a week.

The case:
The customer wanted to migrate all of their data to a new account because of a bad end to a business relationship. The customer said the partner had took all the company stocks, vans, cars, he even stole his girlfriend. He wasn't going to steal his data. No way. Our technical manager at the time even provided a little meme with this large gentleman in a tinfoil hat with a small cat, also wearing a hat. (https://imgur.com/a/9hhoQhd)

Our company had a pretty strict policy on not doing migrations for customers. There was a time when we did but it was stopped when we'd have customers taking up a migration agent for over 6 hours. We might be tech support but we're not that kind. We come free with the product so it's not like having a dedicated tech support service that just remotes in and does it.  

So get the case and then give the customer a call, trying to hold in the laughter at the pic in the case reassignment doc.

Explain our usual crap about data protection and calls being recorded or whatever it was and begin to ask the customer some questions to get some more context. He interrupts me and says something along the lines of.

&gt;No! This is how it's going to go down. You're going to remote into my computer now and migrate my account from this domain to another.

It was a few years ago so my memory is a little hazey. I explained first that I couldn't do that but I was happy to email him detailed instructions and if anything went wrong I can troubleshoot using the system logs. I then went on to explain that the migration was a waste of time and an unnecessary risk on his customer data as we can easily secure the account to a point where the only way we could give them the account would be if they got ownership of the actual domain. Customer wasn't having it. They just wanted me to do the migration but as I already explained, that wasn't happening.

So I then go on to tell them what migration options they should use and ask them to set verbose mode in case anything does go wrong so I have a little more context. Customer was very unhappy at this point and was pretty emotional. Didn't sound that genuine tho as I remember being a little creeped out.

Kept saying no to the customers repeated attempts to get me to do the completely unnecessary migration. Eventually they got angry enough to hang up. I went on to send an email with detailed instructions on how to do the migration with screenshots of everything and the exact servers he had to use. I made it incredibly easy.

Check back the following day and the customer has rang in again, to the wrong department, again, so the case has been transferred twice to two different agents. Not my problem any more!

I use to love and hate cases like this. Often times you get a customer who's just gone through a few of our more useless agents who wouldn't have a technical background so when they get to someone who does they're very happy and that makes everything a lot easier. Other times you're just getting difficult people who won't listen. 

TL;DR Customer wanted to migrate all data for company email and internal databases to a new account because his old business partner had left. This was completely unnecessary because security. Several years of data in a small/medium company so there was quite a lot and there's always a risk you'll corrupt some of your data.

416,The most ridiculous website we have ever built,"I know this is a long story, but there's so much ridiculousness to it that I'd be thrilled if even one person knew of the trials and tribulations I went through over the last 10 years for this very unusual company. The silliest of all of these stories is actually at the bottom of this post, because that was toward the end of my employment there, so feel free to skip down if you only want to know about the most ridiculous website.

I used to work for a membership organisation. The members joined pretty much as a box ticking exercise for the companies they worked for, so they were very much inactive and uninterested in the services (mostly events and publications) of the membership they were paying for.

I think it was this unideal relationship with the members that contributed to the unusual culture in this company. The business managers were incredibly irate and all interactions with them seemed to be fueled by blame culture.

# The first website

It was my first web development role, and within the first week, I had two business managers tell my boss that he hired the wrong person because I hadn't heard of a particular local accessibility company -- right in front of me.

In the first year, I worked with a local CMS company to build my company's new website. I remember one day my boss, a few business managers and I went to the offices of this CMS company to change the spec for the umpteenth time. During this meeting, my boss became so furious with one of our business managers that he was screaming at him while bright red in the face right in the presence of this other company.

In that first year I often traveled to the CMS company to work with them. It wasn't really necessary to be in their offices so often, but it was so enjoyable to be in their presence, and to learn from them in comparison to the usual hostile environment of my workplace, and they were happy to have me there.

On the day that the website went live, I was sat down in a meeting room with all of the business managers, who spent the whole day describing everything wrong with the new website, and that I had made a huge mistake. They refused to use the CMS until it was as each of them wanted, and we had run out of funding for the website, so it wasn't possible to pay the CMS company to make so many huge changes to their core product. So I spent the next few years primarily juggling two tasks: populating content on the website the CMS company and I had built at the requests of the business managers, and building a new website to replace the other in Drupal, which would be capable of everything the managers requested.

# The second website

It was a huge learning experience. I took the needs of the business managers on board, but also looked at the website statistics to see which pages people were visiting, and found that in all 2,000 or so extremely lengthy and difficult to read pages of our website, most of them were never looked at by people, and those that were looked at weren't for long enough to actually read the content. I raised concerns that the content was extremely difficult to digest, riddled with spelling and grammatical errors and weren't being read. The business managers acknowledged that the content which was not their own responsibility was problematic, but each in turn, stated that their own content is correct and didn't need correcting, removing or rewriting.

They concluded that all content should be moved across to the new website as is and will be edited afterwards.

I took a long time to build such a huge and complicated website on my own, but after years of work I eventually got there and released the new-new website, packed full of oddly specific features suited for the business managers and riddled with thousands of pages of unreadable content.

The business managers had once again agreed that I made a huge mistake, the website was wrong, and they refused to use the CMS until I corrected those mistakes.

# A second developer

Around this time my boss had retired and his responsibilities had been handed down to me. At this point I was managing the entire IT infrastructure on my own and so the decision was made to hire a second developer who would work for me, and that should be enough to manage and build upon the infrastructure of the ever-changing requirements of the business managers.

This was really interesting from my perspective. I had no interest what-so-ever in managing people, and other than the CMS company that I worked with previously, I had never spoken or worked with anyone interested in programming or development. It was intimidating to go from being the guy who knew the most, to hiring someone who was smarter and faster than me.

Oddly, my lack of enthusiasm for managing him lead to a really great working relationship. We worked side-by-side and learned together on projects. This is not the traditional manager/staff relationship that I had come to know from others in the company, which were based on power and manipulation.

Within his first month we were asked to demo an idea for the direction of a new project to the business managers. They wanted a CRM that was capable of strange functionality which no out-of-the-box CRM offered. During this meeting we were slaughtered. I had warned the other developer of how the business managers can be, but even I was surprised at just how ruthless they were in berating our suggestions and ideas. The poor bastard didn't know what hit him. He came out of that meeting saying something along the lines of ""They made me feel as though I don't know what I'm doing, but they don't themselves have the understanding to know if I do or not"".

We were told to abandon that CRM project by the CEO after 6 months or so.

# Why are the links blue?

I had been there for years at this point. The toxicity of this culture had slowly grown over time, and like a frog in boiling water, I didn't really notice. I had grown accustomed to the culture, and accidentally absorbed and accepted that any technical decision or idea I had would be questioned and scrutinised relentlessly, and it had become my role to justify to the business managers why. It was also my role to justify to the business managers why their technical decisions and ideas should not happen.

As an example, I have been pulled into various meetings about the colour of the hyperlinks on the main website. ""Why are the links blue? They used to be green. Unless you have a reasonable explanation as to why the hyperlinks are blue, you'll need to change them back to green"". As it happened, I had a reasonable explanation as to why I changed the hyperlinks from green -- for accessibility purposes - it would have been difficult for people with red-green colourblindness to tell the difference between hyperlinks and various page elements which used the corporate red. But this wasn't reason enough for me to have chosen blue without their say so, and so emails were exchanged about shades of blue.

# The third website

After my first boss had retired, I was most often reporting directly to the CEO, but every now and again the organisation would be restructured and I would have a different boss. I think I had a change of boss every year or so, but around year 5, my new boss shook things up. He decided that we should build a new main website! I say ""main website"" because I have missed out that we built a lot of microsites in this time, but the flagship, with its thousands of pages not being read was to be replaced yet again.

My new boss stated that design-by-committee is a terrible idea, but it's exactly what we're going to do! I don't know if he was just crazy or if he wanted to let the business managers design by committee in order to show them that they can't do it that way, but that's what we did, safe in the knowledge that we shouldn't be doing it.

Every single week ended with a full day in a hot meeting room with all of the business managers. We would keep them up-to-date on the details of our progress, and they would change the spec accordingly. We started over with the content too. We went from 2,000 pages of lengthy content down to less than 100. I mean it all still read like a terms of use agreement but hey, progress! Also, because Drupal, and various other CMSs were ""too complicated to use"", we built our own CMS.

It took us about a year to make it and when we finally launched the new-new-new website which was built and designed exactly to the (eventually) agreed spec of the business managers, they once again refused to use it. This time, they couldn't use the excuse that it wasn't what they wanted, but instead kept insisting that they didn't have the time to update the content themselves. My boss, frustrated with how quickly the CEO decided to enforce that we would once again be populating the content on the website using the CMS we built ourselves, decided to quit.

# The most ridiculous website we have ever built

Earlier I mentioned that we made a lot of microsites in this time too. Event sites and such. One of the business managers was responsible for putting out four reports each year - since the organisation began, these had always been PDF files, and according to his input on the spec of the core website, we had built a publications library of sorts. It allowed him (or us!) to very simply add PDF reports as they were released each quarter.

He decided that this next publication would be different. He believed the content to be growing and dynamic, and that we actually need a website for the publication. As you would imagine, by this point, we had become very good at quickly building new websites, and we had the foresight to build the new-new-new website to be service based. We used OAuth to allow membership access restrictions to be used by any microsite we build in future. We agreed that we could do it: we'll build him a website with an easy-to-use CMS for populating content. A few weeks into the project, he arranged a meeting with us to change the spec. This was par for the course now, and we sat down to hear the new requirements.

He described that the structure of this publication website was so intricate that the only way he was willing to write the content was in a mindmap, using some unheard of mindmap software. He proceeded to show us that he had created a mindmap with hundreds branches and nodes. The text in the nodes represent the titles of the pages, and the branches represent their hierarchy within the navigation. He coloured some of the nodes blue (A very controversial colour I have come to know). ""The blue pages should only be visible to members who live in the following areas"" he said. ""And the red pages should be visible by any other member"". Green pages for all members, and the default off-white for any user to access. The actual content of the pages was written inside of a post-it note feature of the mindmap software which allowed basic WYSIWYG editing including inline images.

He went on ""Whenever I update this mindmap, I want to be able to upload it and the website will change accordingly"". This seemed far over spec for a single report. Most of our reports got 40 or so views ever. I looked around the mindmap software to see if it had an ""export as web pages"" option. It didn't. I asked if he had looked for a mindmap product which has such a feature and he refused. This was the solution he had chosen, it was now up to us to make it work. So we did.

We made a website that extracts the contents of a mindmap file, converts its node texts into page titles, its branches into navigation rules, its post-it notes into page content and uploaded images, and the colours of the nodes into user viewing permissions rules.

Very few ever went to the website. Those of who did, didn't navigate through the pages. Those who did, didn't actually read the content. The business manager didn't once ever upload the mindmap himself, he sent it to us. But at least he edited the Mindmap himself! Victory!

And as a cherry on top, he once sent the mindmap file inside a zipped folder -- inside a powerpoint presentation! I didn't even know that such a thing was possible, but having told him that we don't have Microsoft Office, and requesting that he just sends us the mindmap or zipped folder, he once again refused, we must buy Microsoft Office to extract the file.",False,590,67,asitcom,talesfromtechsupport

Cue me trying to reset it but getting an error saying the pw I am setting does not meet the pw standards. Now I have to look up the GP on the pw so I can reset it correctly. After another 30 seconds,


&gt;Ct: ""Are you going to be able to do this today?""

&gt;Me: ""Yes, it looks like your password complexity is set to at least 12 characters and--""

&gt;Ct: ""So did you reset it?""

&gt;Me: ""Just one moment.""


Cue me setting this convoluted pw with all the complexity reqs met and giving it to him over the phone. 


&gt;Ct: ""You can't make this password any easier to remember?"" 

&gt;Me: ""If you enter the password in once it will prompt you to enter your--""
 
&gt;Ct: ""I don't want to use this password can you change it?"" 

&gt;Me: ""It's only a temporary password. Please type it in once and you'll be prompted to enter your own.""


Cue him entering the password while I watch. It prompts him and he enters his own. It starts logging him into his desktop, 


&gt;Me: ""Looks like you're all set. I'll go ahead and get disconnected.""

&gt;Ct: ""Can you send that password in an email?"" 

&gt;Me: ""You mean the temporary pw?"" 

&gt;Ct: ""No, the pw I just entered."" 

&gt;Me: ""I can't see that password but if you have one in mind I can set it manually if you give it to me now.""


Cue me resetting his pw again and un-checking the 'change pw on next logon"" box. I also set the pw to never expire cause he seemed like someone who I would benefit from doing it(we don't usually allow this). I got disconnected after this was done. Mind you, this interaction took 6 minutes. I looked up his server pw on a locker website, connected to his machine and the server and navigated active directory to reset his pw twice. 1 hour later, Management tells me I received a complaint saying that I was too slow and didn't know what I was doing. Thankfully mgmt takes this with a grain of salt but, really dude?  I went back and checked his password to expire and set the maximum pw age to 30 instead of 90. It's not much but whatever, I hate getting negative feedback. 

TL;DR Guy doesn't like my 6 minute IT help with resetting his pw. I made it so his pw expires more often.

419,We'll forward you the resumes!,"Greetings, please excuse me for my lack of syntax words and so on


So I am stopping the support I did on a company, and we've agreed that I ll help them out into finding my replacement.

I set up the requirements and sent them a list (networking + website support + basic hardware knowledge and such) so that they would place an advertisement. 

I specifically asked them to put **my** email for CV's so I could do some picking as they arrive but put **their** phone as contact number because who wants to talk to people.

Weeks went by and I had only recieved 1 resume which was weird. Yesterday the sent me a letter asking If I have picked the best of CV's to which I replied that I have only recieved one.

They proceeded to sent my a **super long pdf of about 40 scanned resumes** with bad orientation, lightning and cropping.

So to get this straight:

They put their email adress as the recepient of the resumes, then they proceed to print each and every one of them and then rescan them all, manually, one by one in a continuous pdf document so they could email it to me.

420,Upgrade vs Change of Service,"I work for an cable service/ISP doing tech support. There are two departments who are supposed to set up ""trouble calls"", the local office and tech support. Billing can set up installs, but our install techs are generally contractors who just plug things in, and don't have the same account access as us or the field techs. If Billing wants to set up a trouble call, they're supposed to get them over to us to do the proper troubleshooting. This story shows us why. 

In this story, I will be VK and our customer will be OL (old lady). 

VK: Thank you for calling CableISP tech support, my name is Void, how may I assist you?

OL: Well my tech left an hour ago and told me he couldn't fix my problem. 

VK: I'm sorry about that. Let me get your account number and I'll take a look at what happened here.

*I pull up the work order tab. There is no open trouble call. There is an install marked complete. I check the notes on the install. The customer had called in about not receiving the music channels on her TV receiver, and the agent she spoke with told her she needed to upgrade to a different (more expensive) box in order to get them. (this is incorrect) The installer did his job and marked it done, but no notes about sending someone else to look into the music channel issue or any indication it was going to be handled.* 

VK: Ma'am, if you don't mind me verifying, the issue you called in about yesterday was an issue with your music channels, correct?

OL: Yes, and I don't understand that because the young man I spoke to yesterday said they would fix it. 

VK: I see... are those new boxes working?

OL: Yes ma'am, except for the music channels.

VK: Perfect, bear with me for a moment while I look something up.

*Pull up  a different part of the account. All her channels packages are listed and checked, except for music channels, which she's supposed to have. I set up a change of service to add the channels and have her to restart the boxes.*

OL: So I didn't need a new box?

VK: Technically no, if you want your old one back we could arrange that for you?

OL: Oh no, these work so much better.

*generic small talk and end of call words* 

TL;DR: CSR broke the rules and sent an installer to do a field tech's job. Found issue could be fixed by simple change of service, and the CSR basically forced a higher priced upgrade on a customer for nothing. Luckily customer likes the new boxes, so no harm, no foul for them. Could have turned out so much worse but did not. ",False,109,10,voidkitsune,talesfromtechsupport
421,You backed that file up yourself? Where?,"Hey TFTS!  This is a short tale that came into my life earlier this week that I thought I'd share as I reflected on the last couple week's events on this Friday night.

This story doesn't have a ton of payoff, was just a fun affirmation of the beauty of IT.  Read at your own risk!



**The Background**
I work as an enterprise storage and backup administrator for a national service provider with just under 50,000 objects.  That's physical servers, VMs, pieces of other standalone gear, and protected laptops that my team services.  As such, I work primary with managing arrays and tending to our backup infrastructure.

**The Prelude**
It's an average week of on-call for me.  We have specific duties for our on-call person outside of the normal flow including responding to our restore tickets and then any non-project requests for extending storage. Because of the size of the environment, these tickets stream in at a fairly regular pace to the tune or 6-8 per day most days of the week.

It's about 11:15 AM and I am just looking longingly at my phone, contemplating the great mysteries of what the cafeteria will be offering over lunch, when my laptop speaks up with a familiar harp strum alerting me to an incoming ticket.  With an all too practiced sigh and at great personal expense, I turn my chair quarter clockwise and bust open my Outlook client to claim and read the ticket.

*""Dear Backup team,  please extend the C disk on &lt;$serverName&gt; by 500gb and verify we have a good backup from last Friday.""*

This is a little bit of a problem because unless it's a VM it's unlikely there's free extense to just grow into.  But, some of our older builds have these ""Image"" drives on them that are 40gb and are not necessary, so maybe there's something to delete...

**The Rub**
So, I RDP in and fire up Tree to check out what is eating what.  It's a 250gb C drive so the fact this is full at all is surprising to me.  Maybe someone grossly misconfigured SSCM and this server has all the patches ever.  Maybe someone who had no idea what they were doing put a SQL database on C.  WHO KNOWS.

I drill down and the problem becomes obvious quickly.  There is a zip file called ""backup"" on the C:\Restore.

I browse to this location and open the zip.  There is a zip file called ""backup"" inside C:\Restore\backup.

I open the zip.  There is a zip file called ""backup"" inside C:\Restore\backup\backup.  This repeats a couple more times.

Right away I call the guy who submitted the ticket and I am just too eager to get his story that I am willing to delay the Southwest Patty Melt being offered downstairs.  So I ring him up, I rest my head on my hand while holding the phone with my other, and furrow my brow in increasing levels of curiosity.

Every week this gentleman selects his entire C:\ drive and ""sends to zip"", and then leaves that zip in C:\restore as his ""backup"".  He didn't even know that we used a product to protect his server, he just thought we fixed things when people had trouble on their own.

Every other week when his C fills up he'd go dump his copy and take another from scratch.  He finally just got sick of doing this and thought he should ask for more space so he could fit more backups.  He's been sitting around zipping a C:\ drive on an active server every Friday for the last two years...

422,"'Please don't use my name when you tell this story.""","Working for a University, a large portion of our users are people with doctorates who often forget that they aren’t experts in everything. On this fateful day I had interacted with many of these individuals and was admittedly not in the best mood. The players in this story are $ME and $TEACH, an instructor at the University who is several states away from the operating location of myself and my team. 


$TEACH had submitted a ticket the day before regarding her laptop, which could not connect to her home WiFi. She neglected to point out that her laptop could not connect to *any* WiFi, a detail I dragged out of her after my team couldn’t figure out what was wrong. I asked her to give me a call, and late that afternoon, she did just that. 


&gt;$ME: Hello! I understand you’re having trouble getting your laptop to connect to WiFi. I’d like to do some troubleshooting with you, but that would be easiest if I could connect to your computer and take a look. Do you have a desktop computer in your home with a wired internet connection?

&gt;$TEACH: I do! I’m not sure which cable is for the internet, though. 

&gt;$ME: That’s quite alright, could you go to the computer and take a look? 

*I explain what an Ethernet cable looks like to the best of my ability*

&gt;$TEACH: Oh, is it the one that looks kind of like a phone cable?

&gt;$ME: It is! Make sure you press down on the little tab before you remove it. 

&gt;$TEACH: Okay, I’ve plugged the cable into my laptop and it has a little loading symbol.

*A few moments later*

&gt;$TEACH: It says ‘unidentified network’, but I don’t have any internet. 

At this point I proceed to spend about 5 minutes walking the user through troubleshooting this error, most of which involves rapid Googling and reading her the steps because I rarely see this error on what I assume to be a functional network. 

&gt;$ME: Okay, so at this point I’m curious as to whether or not this issue is related to the cable you’re using. Could you connect the Ethernet cable back into the back of your desktop so we can see if it has the same problem?

*short pause*

&gt;$TEACH: (*I can hear the nervous laugh in her voice*) Before I say what I’m about to say, I need you to promise me you won’t tell anyone about this. Actually, I know you’re going to tell people, so maybe just don’t identify me when you do. 

&gt;$ME: Of course, what happened?

&gt;$TEACH: I was supposed to take the cable out of the computer and not the wall, wasn’t I?

&gt;$ME: (*struggling to suppress a laugh*) Yes, the Ethernet cable needs to be connected from your wall into your laptop.

&gt;$TEACH: I’m so embarrassed, I even helped a tech last week to set up a whole computer lab on the campus. Please just don’t tell use my name when you tell this story!

&gt;$ME: It’s an easy mistake to make, I should have mentioned it when we were switching cables around. My lips are sealed.


At this point she got connected to the internet, I remoted in and uninstalled/reinstalled the drivers for her network adapter, and all was well with the world. I’m glad she was a good sport, because I should have been much more capable of suppressing my laughter. She turned out to be pretty technologically capable and perfectly willing to accept help, which I can’t always say of her coworkers. All in all, it was a nice way to end my day.

This happened last year, when our Administrator hired herself a new secretary. At the time, we were busy writing up some new policies, and the way our admin generally does these things is that she finds something similar, rewords it, removes things, adds things and slaps our logo on top. Most times, what she gets are hard copies from some of our physicians private practices. Doctors...don't use email.


One day, soon after hiring a new secretary, $admin assigned her the task of writing up a several page document, of which she had a hard copy. The secretary had several days to get this done, and procrastinated until about an hour before $admin was supposed to come in to work. Secretary comes to me, hoping I could save her ass.

$me: I do, yes. But why?

425,Hunting for deleted voicemails,"Just going to start with FTP on here.

After reading this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8cjg9s/his_final_message_goodbye/), it prompted me to write my story of something similar that happened to me.

I worked as a level 2 tech for a while at a major cell phone provider. While there, we would get all the escalated calls that level 1 could not handle (restart of the phone didn't work, reinstalling apps didn't fix the problem, etc.). On this day I get a call from one of the level 1 tech sounding frantic.

$me = the one and only

$cust = customer

$tech = tech that seriously messed up

$lvl3 = third level tech I was pretty good friends with

 

&gt;$me = *generic greeting* this is $me

&gt;$tech = Hey $me, this is $tech from level 1. I think I screwed up.

&gt;$me = *not surprised* Ok. What can I do to help?

&gt;$tech = I have $cust on the other line. He said that he was having a problem listening to his voicemail and restarting the phone didn't help. I decided to reset his voicemail box to have him set it up again.

&gt;$me = Ok. I'm with you so far.

&gt;$tech = Well, all the voicemails got deleted. There were 3 voicemails in there that were very important to him and he wants to know if he can get them back.

&gt;$me = I doubt it. Once the mailbox is reset, it will clear everything out. Did you make him aware of that?

&gt;$tech = ...

&gt;$me = *sigh* Alright, let me see what I can do. Android or iPhone?

&gt;$tech = Android

I had worked on something similar before with another customer but the other customer had deleted the voicemails for work but had done it a few days prior and wanted them back. This one had been done the same day so there was a good chance they were not purged fully yet. I decide to call a third level tech I am good with. They have direct access to where I needed to go.

&gt;$me = hey $lvl3, can you check for some voicemails for me?

&gt;$lvl3 = When were they deleted?

&gt;$me = level one reset the mailbox about 15min ago. Here is the number for $cust

&gt;$lvl3 = ..., Ok I see them. I can't put them back into the mailbox though. Should I download them and send them out?

&gt;$me = *realizing that I have no idea what the $cust wants*, let me conference in $cust

At this time we decided to conference $cust in

&gt;$cust = Hello?

&gt;$me = Hello. This is $me and $lvl3 with *company* tech support. We have retrieved those voicemails that were deleted. Unfortunately we are unable to put them back into the mailbox. Would you like us to send them to you on a disk? there is a $90 char....

At this time he cries out

&gt;$cust = Oh thank god! I will pay anything to have them back! Please!!

&gt;$me = Ok sir. We can do that for you. $lvl3 can you download them and send them out?

&gt;$cust = can you send them as soon as possible?!?!

&gt;$me = I'm sure we can. It may incur an additional cost but you will have to talk with customer supp...

&gt;$cust = *pleading* I don't care, I will pay anything.

At this time he told us the story of why. The messages were the last 3 message he had from his late wife and daughter. There were across the country and ended up in a fatal accident. He was supposed to fly down to meet them 2 days after the accident. When he was trying to listen to the messages, something was going wrong with the phone so he called in to get help which started this whole thing. 

At this time I was speechless. $lvl3 stepped in.

&gt;$lvl3 = I am so sorry for your loss. Let us see how we can make this better for you. We will call you back in 10min with a follow up.

$lvl3 and I called customer support and explained the situation. We ended up getting the Ok to send the disk to him overnight free of charge because it was our fault he lost them. $cust was sobbing when we called him back with the great news and asked to speak to our respective managers. We did get the kudos call for it and the site directory personally thanked us and gave this huge email about how we went above and beyond but that could not compare to the feeling of happiness and relief that I got when he was able to hear that we are getting those voicemails to him.

426,Just a little to the left...,"This story starts innocently enough: I was given one of my first onsite calls for a laptop intermittently losing WiFi connection.

The site in question is located on the 3rd floor of an old factory building made mostly of dense brick and steel girders. There are a couple dozen other businesses here as well, all in close quarters.

I arrive to find the computer in question at a desk in one corner, and the wireless router about 50 feet in the opposite corner, on the other side of two half-walls.

I spent probably about a half hour total troubleshooting, eventually finding that in that *exact* spot, the 2.4GHz channel liked to drop below -90dB every ten seconds or so. I moved two steps to the left (other end of the user's desk) and the dropouts ceased. I tried removing/powering off a few possible interfering devices (a cordless phone, another nearby computer, the user's smartphone) and found no influence from any of these things... it would appear the interference was caused by something external, or the building itself.

&gt; $Me: I can't find the cause, but it seems there's some interference right where your laptop is. However, it seems to not be a problem at the other end of your desk. The simplest solution would be to move your laptop.

&gt; $User: I'm really happy with the spot it's in though. Could we possibly move the WiFi closer?

I had a look and determined it could be done, but would likely require a total rewire of their network hardware. I got in touch with my team lead and he instructed me to return to the office and let a senior tech handle it.

&gt; $Me: Looks like we could do that, but it's outside my scope of work. My boss would like to send a more senior tech out to handle that, so we'll get in touch with you and schedule something.

&gt; $User: Excellent. Could you also have a look at $OtherUser's computer? She can't print.

I then spend another half hour reinstalling the printer drivers for this machine, then I pack up and leave.


A few days later I'm walking down the hall and overhear $ASeniorTech speaking to $MySupervisor about the call:

&gt; $ASeniorTech: ...well now she's throwing a fit wondering why we needed to charge her an entire hour of onsite labor to tell her that.

&gt; $Me: Are you talking about $User from $Company?

&gt; $MySupervisor: Yeah, I was about to come see you about this. What exactly did you do there?

&gt; $Me: [Explains]

&gt; $ASeniorTech: Well I just got off the phone with her. I had a look at their network prints and quoted them for changing to a WAP in the center of the ceiling. She flipped and wanted to know why you needed an entire hour to figure the problem out.

&gt; $Me: I didn't, I had it figured out in a half hour.

&gt; $MySupervisor: Yeah, your time was justified. They're just not happy with the cost.

&gt; $Me: So are we going to install the WAP?

&gt; $ASeniorTech: No, she moved her laptop to the other end of her desk and it's working fine now.

&gt; $Me: ...you mean the first solution she turned down?

It's been a rough week, half my team was out of office for remote-site support and our ticketing system went down just because. The Director for IT support ordered a communications to be sent to all global employees to send in their emails instead of logging tickets, leaving me to sift through the rubbish heap and forward them to the proper action groups. 

The very first email came with the subject title, ""Keyboard needed - Leg broken"" and single line, ""please help"".

Normally, we would just drop an email to users asking that they collect the item at the service desk so as to save us the trouble of looking for them, but there was no way I was making someone with a broken leg come to me for my own convenience. So I grabbed a spare keyboard from storage and went hunting for this poor sap. I found her in the lower level, legs obscured from view and clacking away on a working keyboard.

428,Voltage to ground,"LTL, Not FTP, English is my only language, BBQ

TLDR: we fixed the problem. It was strange. 

I own a small IT company and one of my clients is a large dental surgery clinic. They have an xray machine that is used constantly - they take 50 to 100 shots a day, every weekday and when it goes down, they get unhappy. About a year ago, they xray company sends us a new PC and we start having issues, we finally resolved it by determining that the video card was in the wrong slot. The local xray guys and I have come to an agreement that we'll keep each other notified of any issues.

Queue up the latest troubles. Suddenly, at random times while taking an xray, the PC will bluescreen. I approach the problem as heat related first - keep the cabinet doors open, confirm the ventilation fan is working, add an extra fan to the case. No dice. Get the support guys on the phone (why can nobody get decent hold music?) and they decide to send out a new PC overnight. Get it all built and configured, transfer the data, crank it up for the first xray and... Bluescreen.

Support tells me that it's got to be power related - they're seeing 0.1 volts to ground. For those of you who don't know electrical, the ground is a safety that normally has no voltage at all. A tenth of a volt at household levels is barely going to tickle you, if you are even aware of it (phone lines carry 24v)(and yes, I know it's the amps that get you, but I'm not going into all the details). So we call in the electrician and he checks it all out.

The machine is on a dedicated circuit with a ups and a power conditioner. He can see the 0.1v to ground. He goes and isolates the wires in the panel more. He checks again. He's contemplating running a dedicated ground out of the building for this one circuit when he unplugs the ups. And the voltage to ground disappears. He plugs it back in, it returns. We throw an old ups on there and see no issues. Take some xrays, no bluescreen.

It wasn't until I looked closer at the bad ups to find the manufacture date, that I realized it was a power conditioner as well. We had two power conditioners daisy chained and one of them was failing. I told that office to give the electrician a bonus - he'd earned it. ",False,140,17,GreenEggPage,talesfromtechsupport
429,The case of the panicked NAS,"Yo guys,  


*Short reminder of who I am:*  
LTL, not so first time poster.   
Intern at two companies owned by the same man and solely responsible for the IT these days.  
Generally nothing going on but handling simple problems and looking forward to the next Friday company lunch.  


I got a super short tale that concluded 10 minutes ago.  
Yesterday we put in a ticket with our external IT desk to open FTP connections to our NAS.  
And after a short response asking if we wanted any IP filtering the ticket seemed abandoned (higher priority tickets maybe who knows?).  


Until about 2 hours after I put it in when the NAS suddenly becomes unavailable.  
No FTP, no SSH, no telnet (only internal for emergencies), absolutely nothing internal or external.   


I wobble over to the NAS in a panicked fit to find it's quietly started rebooting. Now this is a 10Tb NAS and it does some verification of the drives while booting so for the next 45 minutes nobody can upload anything. After it finished booting I grab the logs as I want to know who or what queued that reboot.   


Some of you might have guessed it but our external IT desk just rebooted a machine in production under active workload without notifying anyone. General protocol is that quick reboots are allowed but everyone should still be notified before doing so to give them a chance to finish / delay their file transfers.  


I still have to call them over this but thankfully nothing was lost and nobody was uploading anything large.

430,User is too busy to get the help he asked for,"Let me preface this by saying that this particular user is nothing sort of an astonishing stereotype. This is the guy that prints all of his emails so that he can read them. This is the guy that closes his outlook every time he wants it off the screen, and then complains when it has to reconnect to the mail server and takes a second to reopen, seemingly ignoring the hundreds of times I have explained what minimizing a window does.

Also this user is so inefficient at his job that he has to get here everyday a full hour before anyone else so that he can achieve a full day of work; he usually ends up staying later than anyone else as well. All this means that he not only thinks that he works harder than anyone else, he thinks that his methods are the best.

I work as a network admin/general tech help. It is a small company so there is just me to help everyone with their computer issues. 

So User x calls me to his desk this morning as soon as I sit down. He wants to know how to cancel jobs on his new printer when he only wants to print the first page of a document. I have explained to him many many times how to selectively print specific pages from a document, but he assures me that his way of just hitting quick print and running to the printer to press cancel before the rest of the pages print is easier for him. The way he needs to cancel prints on his printer is extremely simple, first press the cancel button, then when prompted on the printer screen with ""Cancel?"" press the ok button so the printer knows you actually want to cancel the print.

434,Tales Slapshots and service outages,"This tale is from a few years ago, before an injury took me out of the cage for long term.  Not really about tech support but trying to dodge work in a weird manner.



The past several days had truly and totally sucked and I was taking Friday off as comp time and was going to meet up with some buddies to play some pick up hockey around lunch time.



I get there about an hour before puck drop, because goalies take a while to get dressed and I wanted to stretch a bit anyhow.  While I'm about halfway dressed I get a call from an account manager demanding I get on a conference call to do something about a fiber cut that has several sites down.  Because of the nature of this network design, I can't do shit.  I attempt to get off this call, but there's nothing for it.  And screw it, i'm in dire need to see some shots this week.



So, muting my phone, I skate out to the bench and drop my phone as near the door, and skate to the net with my bluetooth headset on.  I can hear perfectly.  One of my friends who just got there took a few hard shots at me, and I heard the call just fine.  Tell my buddies to keep an eye on the phone and just go on with the day.



Game on!



So, for the next two hours, the sequence of events is ""Challenge shooter, make save, make save, reset after goal/rebound/stoppage in play, reset to resting position, listen to call, VH save, glove save etc etc.

435,"The support guy say why are you doing this, the system never fails... A month later what is that restore command again?","Years ago (1990's) before I officially joined IT I installed and maintained a real-time factory planning system that uses the UNIX variant called QNX. We used a cabinet to run four fast PCs which served as the server for this application. We used tape backup. 

\--Background info for people who grew up with the internet to know how we existed before Google etc. Skip if you want

 At this time in the dark ages we did not have CIO's and this is before Sarbanes Oxley so it was not unusual for tech savvy business people to do IT projects. Our IT staff at the time only supported the mainframe (token ring I believe) and the phone system. They grudgingly supported Macs running Apple-talk over a separate set of phone wires. Users were on their own with applications, there was no help desk. Rarely did they help with PC issues. The IT director from our corporate office 'helped' me implement the project. Mostly by hounding me mercilessly about missed deadlines. Since at that time my official job title was Planning Manager I had numerous other job duties plus a department of planners, clerks, factory, and master scheduler to manage. Needless to say I was already busy.

Oh and BTW this project also installed the first Ethernet network in our company. We had forty PCs and a 'server' rack of four fast PCs. We used dumb hubs which meant every PC saw every packet. :O

\--Background over

The IT director insisted I practice a restore from tape. This application did not use a database application. I know right? Instead it wrote everything out to text files and basically mimicked a database for all practical purposes. To do this it used a fairly impressive folder structure. Also at that time in the professional journals there were many horror stories about people who faithfully backed up there data and then disaster struck, and when they tried to restore, disaster struck again in numerous ways. The tapes were blank because the machine was broken, they installed the tape drive into a new machine only to find the software was not compatible with the new OS or worse they couldn't find the tape software and the vendor didn't have an old copy. You get the idea.

I read the QNX manual (RTFM) and found the commands. I read the application manual and figured out which directories to backup. I formatted and backed everything up to tape. (We set up a grandfather, father, son tape routine) Now I had to do a restore. Guess what, we did not have a test system or dev environment either so the only place to try anything was in production. So I called support. 

The support guy say why are you doing this, the system never fails...

After some cajoling, he gets the manual out and confirms my commands to do a restore to a parallel directory as well as a method to confirm the restore looked correct. So I go through all of this and document it for the Corp IT Director and he gets off my back. We have to do a practice restore monthly which I write a procedure for and practice.

About a month goes by.

\#Support calls #me.

\#Support - Hey, uh, did you get that tape restore to work?

\#me - Yes, it took a while but it worked, I am practicing it weekly for now and then I plan to back off to monthly. Why?

436,Can I have a new phone please?,"Hello All,

So this happened about a month ago. I am the Network Administrator/IT guy for our site and take care of the servers, computers, Phones. Anything IT related. About a month ago I get a message on the weekend from a user telling me how bad they feel for ruining their phone and asking for a new one. The message went in to detail about how they were sitting around the fire and it was in their shirt pocket and when they bent down, it fell in the fire. It still worked, unfortunately they didn't get it out in time and the screen melted a bit.

That's fine. I assured them that these things happen and it would be no problem. On Monday I preceeded with getting them a replacement and had them back and working by the end of the day. Problem solved.

Here's the kicker. I was walking in the hallway today and encountered the user on their way out for a cigarette. We started chatting and joking and they then asked very seriously, ""can I tell you something?"". I said sure.They proceeded to tell me the real story behind them burning their phone. They told me while at home they fell asleep in their den and their phone was on the night stand next to their coffee. I immediately interrupted with ""you spilled coffee on your phone and to cover it up you threw it in the fire"". They laughed and said no. They said that they woke up from the sleep and picked up their phone and their coffee and went to the kitchen and proceeded to put their coffee in the microwave and selected 30 seconds and hit start. When they turned around they wondered why they still had their coffee in their hand. Then the OH Shit moment. At this point it was probably in there for 10-15 seconds popping and sizzling. They opened it up and it was too late. They started freaking out and panicking about what they are going to tell their boss and me about how they managed to microwave their phone.

I ended the conversation with, ""I am glad you told me it accidentally fell in the fire because I would have been less inclined to give you a replacement if you are going to be microwaving your phones"".

At the end of the day shit happens but the amount of times I have to replace people's gear because of carelessness is sometimes frustrating. Oh well.

437,Sometimes users can be helpful.,"So I work for a company that sells printers to small/medium businesses. We also provide support for them. I am one of those people.

Today I get a call from one of their clients. Their scan to email functionality isn't working. 
I remote in, grumbling. Scan to email is my least favourite aspect of MFPs to diagnose, mainly because a good part of it is out of my hands.

I'll be [Me], and the user will be [U]

While I'm remoted in, I'm checking settings on the printers we page. Meanwhile, the User is poking around the same settings on the device herself, just looking. She found herself on the interface settings screen. 

&gt;U: What's ""Machine IPv4 address""?

&gt;Me: That's the address of the printer itself.

&gt;U: Oh. Should it be the same as the Gateway Address? 

&gt;Me:...no it should not. Good catch! 

I go to the appropriate page on the printers Web image monitor, and sure enough, the gateway address was the same as the copiers address. No wonder it wasn't working. I changed it to what it should be, and lo and behold, scans began arriving in mailboxes. 

I would've seen it eventually, but usually when I'm troubleshooting scan to email I'm checking out other settings, like making sure the SMTP field is filled correctly, that kind of thing. I'm glad she caught it, otherwise I'd have been barking up the wrong tree for a while.

438,"If it sounds impossible, it's probably exactly what happened","I’m a sysadmin for a company with ~1200 employees spread over a dozen states. Part of my job is to manage all our $fruits in our $mdm, but since that isn’t something that requires constant attention I don’t monitor it all that often. 

But yesterday, I went in there and discovered a critical certificate that allows $mdm to interface with $fruits had expired. No biggie I thought, I’ll just renew it. But then I discovered that you need to renew it *before* it expires— if your cert expires, you need to re-provision all $fruits manually. Wait what?! And because I’d conveniently used $mdm to disallow users from un-provisioning their devices, this meant all of our ~400 $fruits (spread over the aforementioned dozen states) would need to be factory reset. Huh, no way could this possibly be correct!! So I signed in to the $fruit portal that $mdm pointed me towards, which honestly I didn’t recognize, but I figured it had been so long since I set all this up that I’d probably just forgotten about it. Sure enough, there was no option to renew the certificate, only create a new one. So I did, and applied it, and to the surprise of no one, nothing worked. 

Well shit. 

With panic setting in, I started doing more digging. Turns out the certs should last a full year, but that would have meant mine expired prematurely, as I had set $mdm up originally and I haven’t been with the company a full year yet. So maybe it was a problem with $mdm...? but now, having replaced the cert, there was no real way to tell. I thought it might still be in my Downloads folder, but nope... there was the app-purchasing cert, still there from way back when I started, but no $fruit syncing cert. So, getting desperate, I phoned $fruit company and asked if there was *any possible way* they might still have the original cert, such that I might be able to renew it, since it shouldn't have actually expired yet. After an escalation, they said that if I couldn’t see the old cert on my $fruit account, it probably was not generated under that account. 

It was at this point I should have put two and two together. But instead I said “but that’s not possible! This is the only $fruit account I ever made for this company!” To get me off the phone, they promised to send me an email where I could provide some written details, and they’d escalate once again. Fine. So I hung up, and while waiting for the email, I called $mdm. 

$mdm wanted me to look at the change log, something I didn’t even know existed. We couldn’t find any record of me ever setting up the cert, going back to the time I joined the company. “But that’s impossible!” I said once again. “I set everything in $mdm up, the only other person who could have....”

And that’s when it dawned on me. 

This whole time, I had been trying to avoid involving the higher-ups in this, figuring that I had fucked up but I wanted to be *absolutely sure* this was irrecoverable before announcing that we’d need to manually reset 400 $fruits. But at that moment I realized, the only other person who knew enough, and had been there long enough, to have possibly done anything to $mdm was none other than my highly-technically-inclined $CIO. So, after 3 hours of frustration, panicking, and phone calls, I went to his office. 

“Hey, $CIO,” I said, “a critical $fruit cert expired today in $mdm. Would you happen to remember setting up such a cert about a year ago?

“Oh, yeah! I remember that. I can update it from my $fruit account right now.” A few clicks later and it was done. And amazingly, despite what the documentation said, everything continued working as it should have, with no re-provisioning necessary. 

TL;DR: the certificate being created before I started was ""impossible."" The certificate being created from a different account was also ""impossible."" Turns out, that's exactly what happened. Less panicking, more critical thinking needed!

A kid brought in his Mac which needed a significant amount of work that he can't afford.  So his generous dad gave him his old work computer to use.  He brought it in to have us wipe it for him and make it like new.  Well, this ""old"" computer is practically brand new and had an asset tag as well as encryption software for the local hospital on it.

Standard procedure is to remove asset tags when retiring equipment, so whenever we see one, we call the company to verify that it has in fact been retired, not just stolen.  I called the hospital help desk, and surprise, surprise this laptop is still active and is assigned to not just any doctor, but a department head.  As is typical when we recover these, someone from the IT dept showed up in our office 10 minutes later to take possession of it.

For those who don't know, losing equipment with protected health information on it is a serious issue.  Lucky for this doctor, it was encrypted, so isn't a reportable loss, but he's going to be in deep shit tomorrow when he gets to work.

So this morning my boss had a voicemail left from a client (They used to call his mobile as he was the only IT guy, now there's more of us and we have an office number that they've been told to call) I deal with most of the support calls so the clients are used to it either being me or my boss handling the issue. The voicemail was something along the lines of ""I'm having an issue with program x, could you remote in and take a look as I'm not sure u/MCManiac52 will be able to solve it"" As the call was made to my boss's mobile and not the office number (a ticket wasn't raised with us either) the issue is classed as low priority and handled when we're free. This all happened at about half 9 this morning.

Fast forward an hour or so and the client calls the office number this time, and fortunately my boss had just gone out. I answer the phone, and get everything I'm expecting to here;

C - Client

B - Boss

M - Me

C: Hi M is B there?

M: I'm afraid not he just went out, is there anything I can help with?

C: Well I'm having an issue with program x but I'm not sure if you'll be able to solve it as you don't have much experience with it.

M: Well I can definitely take a look, am I okay to remote in?

C: Sure.

So I remote into the client's machine and they show me what's going on, an error message pops up saying that they are already logged into a separate session and therefore can't access this part of the program. All I had to do was check the disconnected sessions of said program, sure enough there was one for the client, log it off, restart this session, and boom, everything is working as it should be. All of which took about 5 minutes.

Moral of the story, just because you have little experience with a certain program, doesn't mean you can't read an error message and work out the issue.

So i get to my grandma's and my son starts playing with the toys that she has there. She tells me about the issues saying that my cousin wasn't able to connect to the internet but she gets internet on her phone. I looked at her phone, yep using data.

I go grab the notepad of her passwords, she's getting up there in years, and log into the wifi and go to the management page. (I should mention now that she recently switched ISP). Yep, no internet connection detected. I change the AP login info and write it in the notepad so if things need changed my aunt could do it. I go and look at the AP and the modem and noticed they tech just hooked my grandma's computer directly to the modem and didn't connect the AP. Ask grandma if there was any other Ethernet cables the tech left. She said no. Gathering my son so i can go home and make an ethernet cable for her i spot the bright yellow cable my ISP gives out to customers. Grab it plug the modem to the AP and the computer to the AP.

INCIDENT: So I'm approached by one of my users this morning and she asks if I can set her home computer to access her work computer. I scratch my head, because I know I've issued a laptop to this user that gives her full access to everything she needs to do her work. I proceed to tell her, ""No, it isn't possible. I'm sorry."" To which she responds, ""You just flat out don't want to do it or do I need to ask (the CEO) for permission?"" 

I explain, ""It's just not a good security practice. I would have no way of controlling patch updates and other security features on your home machine because you are running a home version of the OS we use. We also have licensing agreements that say we'll install certain software we pay for on company computers only."" 

I then ask, ""What's the problem with your laptop?"" She then proceeds to tell me that she is tired of having to bring it into the office once a month for patch updates. I calmly explain that if she would leave the laptop on and running at home for a few hours a week, the patches would be pushed to the system and there would be no need for her to bring it in, as the only folks we ask to bring in their laptops are those that consistently fail to be patched automatically. 

She, of course, storms off after her request saying she's going to the CEO. Well. The CEO had my back. ""She (like everyone else) is subject to the way you administer the computers. There's no wiggle room,"" he told me. 

I don't know why, but the whole situation blows me away. If you don't like bringing in your PC every month, then do what I'm asking and leave it running a few hours a week. If not, is it really that much of an inconvenience to have to bring your laptop in and drop it off for less than an hour one time per month!?!

Okay, so this happened a couple hours ago and I thought it was worth sharing. Please excuse any formatting errors as I'm on mobile.

So a little background: I work as L1/L2 IT Support in a big company. My office in particular is mostly filled of accounting people, and there is one $Luser that is very energetic and while she can solve simple stuff herself, she sometimes also makes the issue worse before calling IT.

Today she walks into my office and the exchange is as follows:

$Luser: I popped a key out of my (laptop) keyboard.

$me: you did what?

$Luser: Yeah, the key was stuck so I took it off to clean it.

$me (internally): why would you even... - Okay, I'll be right there.

So I go to her desk, and there it was, she had disassembled the whole key, including the plastic thingy that allows it to move up and down. Turns out that something got under the key and the only thing that made sense was to disassemble the key entirely. Ugh! 

Luckily I have some experience putting this things together so I assembled it and nagged her about calling IT first.

448,Rural dial-up fun,"This is a tale from when I did tech support for a locally based ISP in the early 2000's when dial-up internet access was still a thing and could actually still be used to effectively surf the Internet.

I answered a call from a user having difficulty connecting to our service.  For those unfamiliar to dial-up, it requires a fairly clean connection, or else the connection slows or even drops completely.  After attempting several different things such as removing other devices from the phone line, entering connection strings, etc, we had no success.  In my frustration (and perhaps dedication to my employer) I decided to make a site visit.  My job didn't require it, but I just \*had\* to figure out what in the world was going on.

I drove the 50 miles to the customer's house, which I might add was well off the beaten path.  I had my trusty laptop with me and plugged it into a phone jack in the house.  After starting the dialing sequence and listening to the connection negotiation, I noticed an odd occurrence.  About once a second, the negotiation sounds would go silent and start over.  This is when I decided to disconnect everything and pick up a handset.

In the background of the dial tone, I could hear a clicking noise.  I pressed a button to silence the tones to hear more clearly and heard a distinctive \*tick\*...\*tick\*...\*tick\* going on, once a second.  That's when memories of my childhood growing up on the farm kicked in.  I asked if the customer had recently installed an electric fence.  They noted that they had.  We went outside and lo and behold... the electric fence box was located next to the phone line entrance.  I had them unplug it and we successfully connected!

After this experience, I added electric fences to my list of questions to be asked of customers having connection difficulties.  It ended up resolving more than one problem in my tenure.

TL;DR: I drove 50 miles to find out an electric fence was preventing a dial-up customer from connecting.",False,343,27,tblazertn,talesfromtechsupport

453,Flawless logic,"Hello TFTS, long time lurking and I was hoping to share a story someday.    
I got pretty excited when I got into a situation I knew was finally worth sharing, soooo FTP as well!  
Please forgive any formatting errors and be advised English is not my first language.


    Some context:  
I am, among other things, an ""IT coordinator"" in a small call center: meaning I have no formal training in IT but can google better than the next person and have an interest in the field.  
I'm used to fixing the small stuff (My coworkers are for the most part almost computer-illiterate. Not judging, just an empirical observation) and I am in charge of escalating to a local MSP in a clear and descriptive manner when I feel the issue is above my skillset. 


Early one morning, a visibly annoyed phone operator ($PO) came into my office with an issue she could not resolve:

&gt;**$PO**: Hello $Me, I'm sorry to bother you but my computer will not turn back on, there is no light when I press the power button.

&gt;**$me**: Hey, that's no trouble I'm here for that, I'll come check it out.

I left my almost pristine cup of coffee on my desk with deep regrets and followed her

Now I already knew this one was going to be weird: either a really simple fix or a pretty bad case of user error resulting in dead hardware.  
That feeling came from the fact she was nervously rubbing her hands together, sign of a sound mind in turmoil over a fuckup.  The word ""guilt"" was practically embossed on her forehead.

I got to her desk and found the really small form factor (something like 20cm x 20 x 5) desktop they use resting on a small rack under her table.  
I got down on my knees to check it and Immediately noticed something weird: it was upside down.

I Fiddle with it a bit and notice the power cable was slightly unplugged. *easy peasy*  
I make sure it's back in place, flip the small PC and press the power button. A reassuring green light winks at me.

&gt;**$me**: Well that should do it, it was just not plugged in properly. The weird thing is that it was upside down, did you do that? 

&gt;**$PO**: ... *watching her display intently*

&gt;**$me**: ... *at this point I thought I had broken her mind in some way*

I was standing behind her desk, so, slightly suprised by her silence and reaction, I got around it to face her monitor.  

&gt;**$me**: Huh?

The Windows loading screen was upside down.   
after 2-3 seconds of total silence with my head tilted sideways for some reason, an epiphany washed over me and I repressed what was the beginning of a very large grin.

&gt;**$me**: *Looking at her* Did you?...

I met her gaze.

Her eyes were begging me not to finish my sentence. They were silently praying to a higher power for forgiveness and, most of all: oblivion.  

I did not have the heart to confront her. The look on her face had confirmed my hunch and my body language was probably screaming ""oh I know"". That was enough.  

&gt;**$me**: I'll be right back, I have to check something.

&gt;**$PO**: *Kinda whispering* Thank you.
 
Turns out before ~~bothering~~ coming to see me, she had just finished cleaning her keyboard with a damp cloth while the computer was on.  
She had therefore managed to make her screen do a 180 by pure luck (or lack thereof).  
Taken aback, a thought so pure it must have hurt formed in her mind: by flipping her PC upside down (and accidentally disconnecting the power cable), it would surely make the screen flip back... right?

Nope, but A for creativity. 

I got back to my desktop, found out there's a combination of keys that allows you to rotate your screen, went to her desk to fix it and went on with my day with a big ol' smile on my face.

454,"""Can you come over?""","I had a request a few weeks ago to connect a few computers in our student center to a printer in that area temporarily for an event, then remove it afterwards. These computers wipe anything added after restarting, so this would be an extra step for something temporary.

I spoke with the director of the student center, who explained that members of the public are allowed to come in and use the computers but she doesn't want them printing because they're supposed to go to our campus library for that. Fair enough.

I call the event coordinator who put in the request and walk her through our options. I ask if Secure Print is an option for them, and it doesn't sound like something they want to rely on. She normally logs into the event laptops on her profile, then will be running around, so anybody who needed to print would need her ID badge. I offer her a compromise and tell her I can add the printer to bypass Secure Print onto those event laptops, and it will be on there for future events in the student center. This is the best option for her. We set up a time where she reserves the room she's needing and will do a dry-run of the event setup. I let her know I would like to try it remotely but will come over if need be.

She calls me this morning from the room and explains that it's giving them an error when logging in. There's two other staff members in there helping her. The error is normally when the computer has no network connection and can't login to the domain. I run them through general troubleshooting, like asking if there was another port they could try, checking for lights on the NIC, and restarting. She said there was only one port in that room, there were lights, and even restarting did not help. One of the staff just asked if I could come over there as ""It would make things easier for them."" I bring over a spare network switch I have with some cables as I know the event will require multiple laptops to be networked.

I get over there and I see almost immediately why it's not working. There were no lights on the NIC, and there were two network drops on the wall. It was plugged into one marked ""Phone"" instead of the one marked ""Data."" The cable still feels loose, so I replace it with one that's plugged in securely. After that, everything starts working.

462,The Importance of Electricity.,"Okay, this one is your run-of-the-mill story, but I just gotta share. 

Our outside sales staff use a VPN to be able to connect to the POS system via a putty connection, they just call it PuTTY because it's all they know.

I get a call from salesperson ($SP), who generally works from home, it goes something like this:

&gt; $me: Hello I.T.  
$SP: I can't access putty, is it down for everyone?  
$me: Not that I'm aware of.  Tell me, do you have regular internet access, is your email working?  
.. .. ..  
$SP: I guess I can't access the internet, and my email isn't working either.  
$me: are you connected to your WiFi? (I have long since taught $SP how to check her WiFi connections).  
$SP:  I don't see #WiFi coming up on the list.

I prepare for battle, going into troubleshooting mode for something I have no control over,  then the truth comes out before I had a chance to say anything else.

&gt;$SP:  Well, My power is out, would that effect my WiFi?  
$me: hnnggghh

463,Company-wide Outage = Everyone is down.,"Hi all. I work for a cable ISP serving small to mid-sized communities doing tech support. We offer Internet, Cable TV, and Phone services. Like all utility providers, we have outages. Usually they're just for one city, one neighborhood, or even just one street. But every once in a while, it breaks for everyone. We had this happen the day after a holiday.

Shortly before clocking in, my team noticed the queue jumping from 4 idle to 30 in queue. By the time we clocked in, it had shot up to 50 and an outage had been posted. Essentially the customer phone systems went down. All of them. Perfect. Most calls went smoothly, various versions of ""Oh, okay, it's not just me. I'll give it a while."" Others, however..

In this story, I will be VK, and the caller will be Outage Guy (OG)

VK: Thanks for calling $ISP. My name is VK, how my I assist you?

OG: Yeah, I can't use my phone this morning. 

VK: I understand. I apologize for the interruption to your service. Unfortunately we are experiencing an outage affecting the phone services of most $ISP subscribers. We are working on the issue and will have everything up and running again as soon as we can.

OG: ... So when are you sending the tech out?

VK: I'm sorry?

OG: You're sending a tech to my house. I told you my phone doesn't work, and I want a tech to fix it.

VK: Unfortunately this is not an issue with your equipment or the lines in or around your home. We would not be able to send technician to your home for this. 

OG: ... So you're not going to fix this?

VK: We are currently working on the issue. We will have your phone back in working order as soon as we can. 

OG: You're useless, you know that?  

\*click\*

Lather, rinse, repeat for the following 8 hours.


Edit:

I forgot the best part:
 In order to get to me, the caller had to hear a message that stated there was a company wide phone outage that was being worked on. ",False,694,72,voidkitsune,talesfromtechsupport
464,When someone cares a little too much about their call times,"I've been working support for a cable ISP for a few months. Recently I took a call from a customer who said that she'd gotten a particular agent two times and both times her call had dropped after a few minutes. Something clicked and I realized I'd heard the same story from a few other callers in the past few weeks, always about the same agent. She (the agent) had dutifully noted the call drops in the tickets. I got suspicious and did some digging in this agent's past tickets and found several dozen drops a month. Seeing as I average maybe one or two drops a week, this seemed excessive.

I pulled the accounts of those customers with dropped calls and noticed they all had our telephony phone service--basically a cable modem with analog phone ports. So I went back to the most recent, the one I'd talked to. Her modem had uptime that put its last reset right when that second call dropped. Yeah, you know where this is going.

So I grabbed an engineer who has access to the user logs on the switches and sure enough, this agent had issued reset commands twice on the caller that day. We pulled logs on a half dozen other dropped call tickets for that agent, and every one of them had their phone system reset mid-call.

I was told later they set up a trap call to see her do it. Every call she got, first thing she did was check to see if the call was coming from our telephony system. If it was, she'd go through the motions for a few minutes and then reset them modem to kill the call, all in the name of bringing down her handle time. She'd been doing it for at least six months.

I hope her job search goes well.",False,1385,121,ftbc,talesfromtechsupport
465,"Yes, changing the SSID will require you to update network settings.","I support educational multi-media kiosks installed in doctors office exam rooms. All files are stored locally so an internet connection isn't required for most features, but they do upload reporting data to our server, so it is needed for that and a few other things. Almost all of our customers just connect the kiosks to their wifi rather than running ethernet to their exam rooms.

A customer emailed me today after seeing zero usage on their kiosks for the second half of last week on a report. She wondered if our server was down then and that might have been the cause of the problem. I confirmed that we hadn't had any outages on the server, but noted that all of her kiosk went offline last Thursday morning all around the same time. I asked if they had any network changes about that time. 

Her response via email, ""We were having slow internet so our IT guy did something on the back end, but the idea was to just change the name and not the internet connection as he knew that he’d have to reprogram all the kiosks"". I have lots of questions about this strategy, but have learned that asking these types of questions of users isn't all that helpful to solving the problem.",False,123,6,samgam74,talesfromtechsupport
466,Can't you just mail it to me?,"I work help desk for a large public university, so oftentimes we get callers that ask about getting their transcripts. After a certain amount of time without logging in, a student or alum account gets deactivated, and after reactivation, it takes until about midnight for account information to sync with the student records server. This information includes things like transcripts. Transcripts are easiest to access through the official student portal, although there are other ways to get it, namely coming into the student records office.

The other day I ($me) had this user ($alum) give us a call:

**$alum:** ""Hi, I'd like to access my unofficial transcript. I keep trying to log in but it's telling me my login information doesn't match any active accounts.""

**$me:** ""Hey there! What's your username?""

**$alum:** *$username*

**$me:** ""As I suspected, looks like your account was deactivated since you haven't logged into your account for awhile. Let me just reactivate it for you, and you'll be able to access your unofficial transcript about 24 hours from now.""

**$user:** ""Can't you get it to me any sooner?""

Oh boy. I've had people like this before. They've procrastinated something too long and now they won't be able to get their transcript in time for their whatever.

**$me:** ""Well, the soonest it could possibly be on your account would be at midnight... if you need it sooner, our student records offices close in about 45 minutes and you would be able to go there and they could print out your unofficial transcript for you.""

**$user:** ""No, I live in $suburb-that's-less-than-5-miles-away, I can't possibly come in. I need it by midnight tonight, can't you just mail it to me?""

**$me:** ""Um, I'm not sure that we can email you your—""

**$user:** ""No. I don't want you to email it to me. I need it printed out and mailed to me. Can't you do that?""

**$me:** ""Uhhhh... I don't think the mail would get it to you in time. I'm going to transfer you to student records once I get you into your account.""

It's not my problem that you put this off for too long. It's your problem. There's even a very simple solution. If you don't have a car we even have this thing called public transit and it definitely goes to your suburb.

The mail system doesn't work like you think it does.",False,1668,135,Markothy,talesfromtechsupport
467,Sometimes it really is the simplest solution,"Get a new ticket in from the resident batship crazy lady in the lab downstairs, something about 'Frozen windows on Ubuntu'. Quick remote in and check of running processes and performance has nothing jumping out, so since her lab is on the way to the shops and it's lunchtime I decide to wander down there and have a look in person.

She has quite a few windows open, and yep they're frozen alright. Can't interact with any of the elements inside of them, can't close them or drag them around. So I shove her aside and get to work. I got this.

* Switch virtual TTY away and back, nothing
* Restart X - still nothing
* Restart lightdm service - no dice

These windows would just not go away.

Wait, am I being dense?

No

468,Insanity is sending the same mail over and over and awaiting a different response from the auto-responder,"This is fresh from the ~~oven~~Microsoft Outlook. It's been barely half an our since I read the mails.

First; preface... I'm Zztri, I'm a developer specialized in a few branches of the buzzword ""Smart Cities"". I'm also known as an undertaker - whenever I join a project this means it's dying and my job's to save the project if I can or at least lower the impact of failure.

Lately I became a consultant for an energy company for a GIS - geographical information systems - project. I did what I could for a  couple months but my kidneys acted up - kidney stones so my doctor asked me to take a few days off and enjoy some thermal spa.

Ten days before I started contacting every single person responsible with the project, telling them;

&gt;Because of health problems, I'll be unreachable from *last wednesday night* to *this monday morning*. Please contact me ASAP if anything urgent needs to be done. I won't be reachable at all during this period.

Wednesday night I set up the auto-responder simply reminding people the same thing and set out to the spa. As principle, my business phone was off and noone knows my personal phone #. I do not use social media at all, not even linkedin.

Anyway, I had a good time and I feel much better now. Today at 7am, I decided to check out my mail messages for the first time in four days. About 200+ mails in four days, including the weekend.

&gt;*Luser #1*: I can't login to the reporting system.

&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm at vacation, remember?

&gt;*Luser #1*: I just realized it needs me to be inside the office to login to the reporting system. There must be a way to check out the progress at home. **(Of course, genius, intranet applications can only be reached in the office network)**

&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?

&gt;*Luser #1*: I know you're on vacation but I'd like to check out reports outside the office. Can't you quickly fix something?

&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?

&gt;*Luser #1*: I spoke to CTO and he said you're unreachable until Monday morning. In case you read this, I need it earlier if you can.

&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?

......

&gt;*Luser #2*: I just got a great idea. We need templates for certain field infrastructures so our field agents will do less work. **(Oh good idea, something similar to the 'Templates' in the main menu, right in front of you?)**

&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?

&gt;*Luser #2*: *(This one's CC'ed to the CTO)* I know you're on vacation but this is urgent. I'd like to see you take immediate action.

&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?

&gt;*CTO*: Zztri is on vacation. Is there something wrong with the template system already implemented?

&gt;*Luser #2*: *(responding to both CTO and me)* What template system, noone trained me about the template system.

&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?

&gt;*CTO*: We were in the same training session when Zztri showed about it. It's also in the training material, video 'Field Operator Actions' starting at xx:yy:zz. Field operators are actively using the templates; for example I can see four different templates for transformer buildings in area N.

&gt;*Luser #2*: *(still responding to both CTO and me)* Oh I see. I'll check it out.

470,TFTS: Definition of Insanity,"[As $GoodSister pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/patches765/comments/8wt8t8/languages_and_cultural_immersion_part_1/), I've been a bit busy these past two weeks covering vacation shifts. I do take vacation, but I can't take it at the same time as certain individuals due to coverage. This time... $Tunes... 


Which is annoying on multiple levels. First, I miss $Tunes... we have wonderful, intellectual conversations on a variety of subjects. Second, it is kind of creepy being the only person on the floor for the last three nights. 


It is finally slow at the moment. Time to get some writing in.


**Holiday Coverage**


You know we had a holiday this week? I couldn't really tell looking at the maintenance calendar. Freaking hard moratorium and I was double booked... seriously? It was supposed to be ZERO. I was looking forward to writing.


To make matters worse, my entire department was supposed to receive a holiday lunch. One of the perks for working a holiday. Except... the person in charge (fairly new) completely forgot our department existed. Ok... shoot... 


Except... I didn't bring a lunch... and I couldn't buy a lunch... because everything was closed due to... you know... A HOLIDAY. 


Basically, I was screwed. 


To make matters worse, one of the maintenances went REALLY bad. Not my fault, I swear!


I was granted permission to buy something... but would have to go downtown to do so. I would be away from my desk for about an hour... in the middle of working maintenances. Was not an option if I gave a damn about customers.


Missing one meal wasn't going to kill me. However, management WAS made aware of the screw-up. 


**Access Denied!**


We had some transport gear fail in the field. The maintenance was an emergency card replacement. Fairly routine. Shouldn't have been an issue. Except... the alarms didn't look right to me. Transport is handled by a different group. I have zero visiblity to the gear or their alarming systems, but I can read their ticket worklogs.


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


That isn't a card failure alarm. That is something else. It just felt wrong to me. I told $Optical what I felt.


&gt; **$Optical:** $Vendor said it is a failed card.


Some how transport was still working, but it was definitely sketchy. I agreed that it needed to be fixed. A critical alarm was not something to be scoffed at.


$Tech gets on site, and has problems accessing the building. He had a key card, but it wasn't working. One hour, fifteen minutes later, that finally gets straightened out. He now has access to the building. I should note, $Tech was an employee of the very same company that owned the building. A bit odd, but apparently there was a recent change made and not all techs were set up correctly. I'll just go with it.


He arrives at our cage. These at one time had card readers as well. Except, they were recently torn out and replaced with padlocks. $Tech was not informed of this recent change.


Who has the combination? There wasn't any record of locks being on site. Another hour wasted to track this down.


Finally, $Tech is able to view our equipment. And... $Vendor had him verify the critical alarms were active. THEN... they decided to have the card delivered. This was pre-ordered twelve hours ago. The courier was close by, but couldn't find a parking spot. He ended up just pulling in front of the building so $Tech can just grab it.


&gt; **$Patches:** Now, don't drop it.  


I don't think $Tech appreciated my joke. This card... would probably pay off my house. We aren't talking cheap gear here.


**Definition of Insanity**


Time to do my part. Most traffic we re-routed to other paths, and what remained were secondary. This should be quick and easy.


Per $Vendor's instructions, $Tech powers down the gear, inserts the card, and powers it back up. Except... nothing is working. We only had a singal alarm come in through the management port.


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Another power cycle.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Not good. Ok, due to the late start we were approaching the end of the maintenance window. Those secondary paths could not be kept down all night. $VIP-Group gets VERY cranky when they even have to go down for maintenance. They consider it an outage if they pass a certain threshold.


&gt; **$Patches:** We need to attempt a back out. We don't have time for additional testing.  


Due to the critical nature of $VIP-Group's data paths, no one except $Vendor argued with me. The original card (which was working before they toucehd it) was put back in and powered up.


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


The shelf was effectively hard down. It did not recover after the power cycle and $Vendor insisted the issue was the card.


&gt; **$Patches:** $Vendor, I want to clearly state... I find it statistically improbible that a brand new card would have the exact same error as the failed one.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Oh, it happens. Occassionally you get a card that is DOA. We try to test the refurbished ones before they go out, but sometimes these things happen.  


Now THAT was an interesting slip. He said it was refurbished. According to our contract, it was supposed to be new. Notes made for management's sake.  


&gt; **$Patches:** Have you looked at the back plane or shelf? The alarm in question is indicating something else is there.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Why? What are you seeing?  
&gt; **$Patches:** I don't have visibility to any of this equipment. That would be $Optical. I am just familiar with how things work.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Perhaps you should leave this to the people with experience.  


I wasn't going to fight it. After all, this wasn't my gear. I just felt they were looking at this wrong.  


Two hours later (poor $Tech, I suggested he take a nap, but he was afraid to)... another card arrives.  At this point, the maintenance has turned into an outage. 


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


&gt; **$Patches:** Ok... come on, there has to be something else wrong.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** It's rare, but two DOA cards can happen.  


Two hours later (once again, poor $Tech... he was struggling)... another card arrives. The outage got upgraded to higher visibilty.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


&gt; **$Patches:** Really? Come on... There has to be something else.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** I'm ordering a new card now.  


The irritation in my voice was definitely coming through. Some of my local support team expressed concern via IMs. Remember that holiday meal I didn't get? Yah... I was getting cranky, and it was starting to show.  


I handed off to the next shift (was really hoping to see it completed), and headed home. I was already way past end of shift (and my shift is 10 hours long). 


After grabbing food ($Wifie's Korean BBQ experiment), and sleep, it was time to go back to work. The very first thing I did was follow up on the disaster of a maintenance.


Another card... and one more after that... A total of SIX cards were tested.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Not a single one worked. Then, $Optical (not sure exactly who on that team, since I wasn't physically present) noticed that about five minutes before the alarm, the equipment experienced a power hit. There were storms in the area, so this wasn't completely unexpected, except... no one looked at history. (Something that I do on every ticket.)  


This equipment had an interesting glitch that occurred during power surges, such as when power is suddenly turned back on after a power outage. It drops its configs on the shelf.


And... wouldn't you know it? The default configs are looking for a card that hasn't been used in over five years. Which would give you an error similar to...  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Configs were restored from backup. Service came up immediately. Case closed.


**Take Two!**


The night after the holiday was once again filled with maintenances even though it was a hard moratorium. Go fig. Another one... was IDENTICAL... to the issue from the night before.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


&gt; **$Patches:** $Vendor, by chance are you the same individual who worked on a similar issue yesterday?  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Yes, that would be me. I am the on-call all this week.  
&gt; **$Patches:** Second question before I go back on mute. Will you be checking the shelf configs before ordering new cards tonight?  
&gt; **$Vendor:** I just realized who you are... yes... and... Huh... Did this site lose power?  


I was giggling at my desk. 


&gt; **$Optical:** Actually, the building was struck by lightning. Why do you ask?  


I completely broke down laughing.  


&gt; **$Vendor:** The configs are missing on the shelf.  


At this point, I had to excuse myself from the area and grab some coffee. Between lack of sleep and being slaphappy, I wasn't going to be much use on that call.


We had it fixed within the hour.


**Just When You Think It's Over...**


It's close to end of shift... almost there... and... FIBER CUT! God, damn it! 


The next shift wasn't in just yet. Let's ignore the part where there is supposed to be people scheduled one hour before I even leave. So, focusing  on customers, I worked the issue. Coordinated various groups, dispatch sent techs en route, breaks being identified, the usual.


Management, who were notified as part of the outage process, started asking very good questions.


&gt; **$Manager:** $Patches, why don't you hand this off to day shift?  
&gt; **$Patches:** They aren't in yet.  
&gt; **$Manager:** Wait, what? It's past eight.  
&gt; **$Patches:** I am very aware of that, sir.  


I am not sure who was more pissed. Myself or my manager. This was Friday. The office should have been filled. And no one was in to release me.  


I ended up getting out of here at a quarter to ten. I was not happy about it. Management was not happy about it. 


I still haven't received an explanation on what the heck happened there. It wouldn't be the first time a manager accidently gave an entire shift the day off. 


**Epilogue**


My buds from around the states checked with me the next night. They wanted to make sure I was feeling ok, because I just had two nasty nights in a row. I really appreciate that. I told them so. I also explained that I try to start each day off with a clean slate.

471,The promised feature," Another slow sunday at my curent workplace, so it is time to tell another story from back when I was working at \[huge European Cable Provider that shan't be named\].

The company just introduced an new reciever for cable tv/radio and the first few months after its release our team was the only team to support it. Most notable feature of the new receiver was the ability to output 4K, besides that it worked pretty much the same as the old ones.  

Anyways, a few weeks after the release, a wild call apeared!  

Me: This is $ISPsupport, What can i help you with?

 cu: I can't find my channel 

Me: What channel do you want to tune into? 

cu: $radiostation  

Me: No problem, just tune into chanel $chanelnumber  

CU: i cant find it 

Me: do you get some kind of error message?  

 CU: No, you misunderstand, i can't find the numbers on my remote. I'm blind.  

For for some reason the remote has a 2 by 6 layout for the number keys, instead of the old 3 by 4 he was used to. So i explained it towards the customer and had him finally change towards the radio station he wanted to hear. However, he was greeted by silence.  

Luckily the reciever had a bit of remote support, so i checked the channel number. Sadly, the error messages are only displayed to the customer and can not be read through the remote support. So I, without knowing what error message came up, applied a fix for the most common problem and hoped for the best. I told the customer to call again if the problem still occured, but this time he should get some help to tell us the Error code.   

As this was a pretty odd story, I shared it with my a colleagues. A day or two later, a colleague approached me during lunch break to tell me that the blind guy called again. He still wasn't able to listen to his favourite radio station, but this time he had brought someone to help read the messagees on screen. So my colleague was able to tell him that the problem was most likely a bad wifi connection interfering with the 'always online DRM system' (Yes, I know) the Box used. So he told him to use an ethernet cable. In theory this should have fixed the Problem.  

Well, theory being theory, of course new problems arose and over the next few days he called regulary with almost every error message in the book. Everytime we solved one, he got a new one.  The next time I had him on the phone I couldn't resist to ask, why the effin hell he got the new receiver, despite the old one never having any problems (his ticket history told me so).  Turns out a sales person told him the new receiver could be controlled by voice commands, wich was on the planned feature list. But it was to be implemented in about a year. So, while he was following the orders i gave, I hinted at our return policy as much as company guidelines allowed. So did many of my colleagues. After all, it wasn't his fault and he was a nice guy. 

 After about 2 weeks and dozens of calls, the calls  suddenly stopped . I never found out  if he was finally able to get the damn thing working or if he just gave up. But to this day I curse the sales rep for ripping him off. 

 **tl;dr**: blind guy got talked into getting the 4K cable receiver and is suddenly a beta tester, but only wanted a feature that would be implemented one year later. ",False,257,26,lupo_ger,talesfromtechsupport
472,It never ends. Even after leaving the desk,"Ok so I moved and got a new job at a big company (fortune 50). When I got the job it was a huge step up. I am now an engineer. I rarely take calls or do desk side support unless it is something weird or I have it scheduled. Yesterday, after a two hour architecture meeting I was walking back to my desk. The director for my division is wandering around my section (windows engineering). I ask him if he needs anything and he says he can't find anyone but I'll have to do (he reviewed my resume when I was hired and knows I did tech support). He says there is a Windows 10 problem with one of the executives. 

We head over to the executive team. They explain the issue (constant lockouts from their windows 10 PC).  I am not above desk visits for software I customize and support. I rushed over. They tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. I fix it in 2 minutes (cleared credential manager). They look at me and say that was really professional and very good support for an engineer. I find out later that desktop support was only given 2 minutes to respond to a ticket before he went looking for me and that they knew how to fix it the whole time but wanted to see if the team knew. I missed my next meeting to go over requirements for a rollout for their test. I thought I was done with this when moved to engineering. 

Disclaimer: the drinking game suggested below is  fictitious and in good fun. It is not to be attempted for obvious reasons. You will most likely have a bad time and/or die. Last check was 28 mentions of the offending word.

I sometimes get to see history of a ticket when I am looking at a new job. I received a call about a printer not working and saw this in the history, the important thing is that users can open tickets, and re-open tickets if the issue isn't actually fixed, it is meant to indicate bad tech's that just close tickets without doing anything but my mate had to explain what the story was with this as it was ""flagged"" for re-open. It should also be noted, that this is all the same user. Important note: the ticket system is all online through an internet facing page (not intranet, internet) as some tickets are raised by outside contractors and remote users. 

user: ticket open - printer not working every day

tech: ticket response - more information required, printer location and do mean the printer is broken and not working?

user: the printer is located downstairs in the warehouse, and it will print for the accountant and then everyone else but the next day it will not print until the accountant prints again

tech: thank you for the info, I am heading to that printer now. will update ticket with result soon

tech: ticket response/update with resolution.  found that accountant was plugging in the previously networked printer via USB to laptop which was then shared via windows network share. removed cable and networked printer to LAN cable. tested printer via LAN and all works ok. Ticket closed.

User: ticket re-open - printer not working every day. 

tech: this issue was already reported and fixed earlier today, can you confirm this is the same issue with the same printer in the warehouse?

user: yes, and it does not print any day that accountant is out.

user: yes, my workstation is having the issue. 

tech: is anyone else unable to print? it might just be an issue with your workstation. I will come down to your computer and see if it is a local problem or the workstation itself. as the printer has been tested as working on the network I will close this ticket and create a new one if your workstation still has an issue.

I have hundreds of stories I can share.",False,270,12,ITPharma,talesfromtechsupport
476,"If they won't come to me, I'll bring it to them.","This happened several years ago, but I just wandered over here and remembered this story. Some of the details are a little hazy, but I'll try to fill in.

I used to work in a helpdesk that serviced a couple thousand workers in a rather large, multistory office building. I haven't worked in IT for years since this place, and that's in part due to the clientele, one of which stars in this story. Due to the large ticket volume, our helpdesk was broken down into very specific groups, and I was one of maybe 5 people that mostly just took care of printer/MFD maintenance. Should be a relatively low-drama ticket queue, I thought when I started working there.

I had been there for over a year at the time of the ""incident"", and knew just about all of the ins and outs of the office. In this case, make sure all of the printers in high-traffic areas don't have any tickets out on them before going out for a long weekend. Having done that, my team and I head out on a Wednesday afternoon to enjoy some holiday that I can't remember. I'm sure I had a good weekend, as I usually did when I didn't have to show up to work for longer than 2 days.

I get back to work the following Monday and notice the helpdesk area (it's an ""open office"" workplace, we don't really have rooms) has scratches all across the tile floor. That's odd. I sit down at my desk and browse some vaguely tech-related news articles while my coffee kicks in before I face the ticket queue. I finish up and go check in with a coworker that usually picks up the big jobs first thing in the morning so that we can work them together and not have to lone-wolf it all day.

That's when I notice it. A big-ass Lexmark MFD with collating and stapling and large document and whatever else attachments, weighing in at probably 250+ lbs, sitting in front of his desk where it oughtn't be. With feet sitting neatly at the end of the floor scratches. 

He chuckles and pulls up the ticket to show me.

&gt;Department Head Such Andsuch (totally his real name, you can look him up! ^^/s ) had put in a ticket for a jam late Wednesday evening after most of the office had cleared out.

&gt;Mr. Andsuch updated the ticket Thursday morning to bump it to the top of the queue and marked it Urgent. I believe he even noted that there was another nearby, but slightly less convenient, printer that he would use until the issue could be resolved.

&gt;Updates it again Thursday afternoon, saying he called the office and received no answer. We put the on-call phone number in the voicemail for emergencies, and because he's a department head he has the (home) phone number for our department head as well. Neither of these phone numbers were called.

&gt;He updates it once more Friday afternoon, notifying ~~the ticket system~~ us that since nobody had handled his ticket, he was going to come upstairs and have us fix it personally.

There were no further ticket updates. Only evidence.

This poor guy pushed the printer down a long basement hallway, into an elevator, back down the vertically adjacent hallway and into our office, only to find it completely empty. Did I mention we remove the casters from our large printers to dissuade users from relocating them to ""better fit their needs""? The scratches along the floor extended the entire path he took, less a couple of carpet patches along the way, including into and out of the elevator that his bosses' bosses' boss takes to his/her office.

We laughed a bit more after having gone through the ticket history together. My coworker is more of a morning person than I am, plus he gets there an hour before me anyway, so he had already gone over the internals, cleared the jam, and replaced the maintenance kit for good measure. He was told to leave the offending paper and any parts with the unit in our office space for ""future reference"" by our department head.

I don't think much came of the situation other than a nice, probably long-winded, verbal redressing of Mr. Andsuch, and he probably still works there to this day. We had a good laugh and a good story for the new people, and it didn't really inconvenience us much to put back in place. Mostly because of the large flatbed cart we keep in our space a few feet from where he left the printer.",False,137,25,rumphy,talesfromtechsupport
477,No Good Deed Goes Unpunished,"Previous story from the silly datacenter in the middle of nowhere [here](https://redd.it/8w494i).  By request, I have one more to share from this place.  Will try to cut down the ramble (yes, this was longer), add more four-part harmony and feeling.

**Background** - My career so far has been a series of IT gopher positions, where I have learned near every subject in depth because no one else could or would.  My previous job had a large database oriented system... lets call it DB600.  Biz had bought this app to run on, but the system was an arcane and magical black box to all the muggles.  Once I came on as gopher, I got shown a dinky SQL prompt and was told ""make all the reports"".  So I learned SQL, and I did.  Lo, the gopher became the wizard, I pried many secrets from the arcane DB600, and I was even modifying the core app and writing simplish programs (lets call the language ""BFG"", it amuses me).

With all my ad-hoc learning though, I was pretty much a competent amatuer.  I longed to learn the ""right"" ways, from real pros.  Thus my pilgrimage to the datacenter, who had a DB600 that needed overseeing, and the holy mages of programming, who said ""Shaddup kid, you don't know anything, and we're too busy to babysit, so do what we tell you and dont touch our stuff.""

Le sigh.

**Here we go** - The operator gig on DB600 used a simple custom tool to process and log incoming backup and job requests, sending pop up messages to let us know what needed doing and telling users to get out.  It didn't control the entire system, just the part they wanted more order on.  Maybe a year or two in, said tool starts losing jobs here and there.  We'd get an incoming notice, acknowledge it, and then just find nothing available to run.  We work around it, or user resubmits.  Time goes on, problem gets worse.  Problem gets documented, system programmers take over.

Their response:  
- The problem is caused by duplicate records in the tool's history database. (er, how'd they manage that, but ok, yeah, sure)  
- To correct the issue, we need to purge out of date records from the history. (OK, keeping this year and last year, uh huh, got it)  
- Ops team is directed to use the tool to manually remove these records.  (*thud*)  

... The tool does have a function to view history, page by page, and remove entries, one by one.

My jaw dropped.  I checked my understanding with my $coworker, and his jaw dropped.  We asked for clarification, and got it.  They seriously wanted us to go through some 7-8 years of history and purge the history file line by line.

Being a dutiful sort, my $coworker started.  I helped streamline where we could, but at our best guess, with one person dedicated on it, we *might* get done in two weeks.

The more I saw him work it, the more the monotony, the repetitiveness,... the sheer *stupidity* crushed me.  *There was zero reason to do things this way in a database system*.  I absolutely knew that.  I hadn't heard of any crush project or programmers burning the midnight oil.  The only logic would be keep-our-tape-slingers-busy, or just plain spite.  And I got pissed about it.  More pissed I got, the more I indulged my unprofessional side and put my wizard hat back on.

Need more info.  
What database is this in?  
Check $coworker session locks.  He's using the same $TOOLDATA tool always uses.  
So there's not a ""history"" file, just one file. Tool must present a view for new jobs and a view for old jobs.  
What can I find out about this file?  
No access to that.... No, not useful.... Ah! Here's the file layout!  
Just the fields we see in the tool.  Submitted timestamp, job number, user details, release details...  
Job number is the index field?  8 digits long.  Even I know the system re-uses them eventually. Not a timestamp, or a combo?   
No wonder ""duplicates"" popped.  Bad design from the start.  
Still can't work the file though.  I need the data too.  
Start ""BFG"" tools... access denied, not surprised.  
Start data file utility... access denied.  
Start query manager... access denied. *sigh*  
Start SQL tools... access denied.  
Start dinky SQL prompt.... HELLO WORLD.  Careful now, step by step, don't screw up.  
SELECT * FROM $TOOLDATA;... its all there.  Only diff between old records and new records is release timestamp.  Scroll through a lot to make sure.  Can even see the recorded job numbers cycle back to 0000, two or three times since this record started.  
SELECT * FROM $TOOLDATA WHERE SUBMITDATE &lt; lastyear;...  review data rows again, slower, to make absolutely double-sure I caught only what fit the purge criteria.  
Hey, $coworker, stop that and back out of the tool a moment.  
Change SELECT * to DELETE.  Try not to flinch.  Hit enter.  
Start up tool.  Check history.    
I just saved us weeks of useless stupid busy work, by spending a little over an hour learning their setup.  
Document steps taken and inform.  

Supervisor calls me over later that day to issue me a formal written warning, approved by everyone upstream, for failure to follow instructions (absolutely true), and failure to use test environment to test my solution (true, but bullshirt, we werent even given logins for it).  $Coworker thanks me profusely.  Double-check two days later, yep, locked out of dinky SQL prompt.

478,Our mailserver has been hacked!!,"Related to my previous [tale from tech support ](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8srhto/sorry_was_that_server_important/) I was going through the email settings for 2 of my client systems. One was heavily reliant on EWS and as such was highly tested by the client before use, the other system used the exchange as an SMTP relay - solely for sending canned and SSRS reports to local users, as such SMTP relay beyond their domain was not allowed. 

I had gone through the code bases for both systems, and the backing SSRS setups for both systems to ensure the new mailbox was being used. The last step was to test my changes; the EWS reliant app worked perfectly well, reading mail and sending it. 

As the SMTP relay was blocked outside of the domain, I could only send it to our account mailbox, which was fine as it was an account set up solely for our Application to use. 

I tested each instance of our system, sending a sample report to our mailbox with the subject line ""Hello Friend"".  Each system worked, I reported to the client they were ready for testing and head off home for the weekend. 

Mid-day Monday a support ticket comes through with some high urgency from our client, we think our mailserver has been hacked. With my curiosity piqued I read the ticket. Something along the lines of - 

&gt;""our administration mailbox received an email *from itself* and the text of the email is somewhat concerning. It contains a singular line which says 'Hello Friend' - what is more worrying is that they seem to have been trying to collect data contained within $ReportIwasTesting"" 

So it turns out that $CNA had set up a rule in our mailbox that any mail sent to our exchange account was automatically forwarded to the business admin's inbox, not only that but the same identity was used for both accounts - so unless you looked at the mailto address you wouldn't see it was from our inbox. 

Suffice to say I found it hilarious having to explain to a very worried team that the mail was from me; and that ""Hello friend"" just how I talk.

479,The pen is mightier than the camera,"Hello TFTS. LTL; FTP, etc. Also, english is not my native language, so if I mess something up, feel free to point it to me and I'll correct my mistakes. TL;DR. at the end.

Let's start with a little background.  My last job was a mix of audiovisual, events and integration work and I covered a lot of ground between those. For this specific tale, let's just say I was employed by a company that was a subcontractor to a subcontractor to a big telecom company (Big Telecom) that sells comprehensive videoconference systems (from monitors to backend infrastructure). This is about one of the first installs we did. Since we were the ones that installed the devices in the VC room that today's story is about, we were the ones sent when something happened.

The setup in this room vas what we called a vanilla setup: two monitors, a camera placed between them and a codec hidden behind one of the monitors.  This setup implied that if you wanted to display someting on the TVs, you had to go through the codec. Note that.

Now to the actual story:

A user from the client company called their inhouse support, that then called Big Telecom, that called... well you see were this is going. There was something wrong with the camera. They said it wasn't moving or responding to commands sent with the system's remote.

I was assigned the job and as I read the problem description, I thought that somehow the little servos powering the camera had been disabled as they would do so when someone manually (as in with their hands) move it.

Turns out I was right.

What I didn't expect was to find a whiteboard marker *wedged* in the camera yoke, effectively blocking its movements. Some user decided that the camera pointing towards them while presenting content was annoying. Instead of using the remote that was in **plain view** on the conference table to have it pointing somewhere else, the used the next obvious solution. A whiteboard marker.

I restarted the codec and the servos where working again.  We still laugh about this one to this day.

Hope you enjoyed my story. I have a few more where that comes from.

Who also does not contact IT.,"So the EVP over sales recently got a new PC and had immediate issues with it. We, in the IT Support area, never knew about the issues. 

Today I get an email demanding my attention at a meeting in the main corporate headquarters 10 miles down the road from the IT facility. I drive over there and immediately walk into the meeting 10 minutes early.

All of the execs, VPs, higher ups, supervisors, and I believe one guy eating popcorn all showed up to watch me get roasted. 

The meeting started out very confrontational with everything directed at me about some issue I had no clue about and some VP who I never met who was pissed her issue was not resolved. Ill skip the preamble and go straight to the head desk. 

After proving beyond a shadow of a doubt, by calling the CIO directly and putting him on speakerphone, I took a look at the issue.

&gt; $Me = Algernop Krieger

&gt; $ME - So you are missing files since getting your new PC?  
&gt; $DVP - Yes. I thought one of the reasons we got citrix was to prevent these kinds of issues.  
&gt; $Me - I can go ahead and look at this to see where you files went. (30 seconds later) Umm... your citrix profile is completely empty. Is your username $DVP?  
&gt; $DVP - Yes, but you wont find anything in there as I don't use citrix. 

Freeze frame. Full stop. Queue the word music from ff7 after Meteor had been summoned. 

&gt; $Me - So you dont use citrix at all?  
&gt; $DVP - No. I hate it, its slow, it reduced my productivity, and generally is not a good experience to use.  
&gt; $ME - So why would your files be transferred over from one PC to another if you never used citrix?  
&gt; $DVP - Citrix makes backups of all files. You said so yourself in your email to me 3 years ago.  
&gt; $Me - Well I was not with *our company* three years ago but I do know the email you are talking about. That only counts for files inside citrix.  
&gt; $DVP - I do not understand what you mean.  

Several people around the room did not either. The more technically inclined did. Several eyes focused on me like a laser while several more started rolling. The guy eating popcorn was eating his popcorn at cartoonish levels now. 

&gt; $ME - *Does not even hide his exasperated sigh.* Imagine this. Say you did not have an office assigned to you.  
&gt; $DVP - I fail to see how...   
&gt; $ME - Just roll with it. Imagine that every day you had to go to a new desk. Also every day you carry around a box with you with all of your office supplies. Now what goes inside the box, stays in the box for you to use. What is outside the box, is lost when you change desks.

The local profile xfer went perfectly, I removed all old shortcuts that were to old 2010 office programs and cleaned up any duplicates she had on her PC. 

At the end $DVP questioned CIO on why this took 4 days to fix. The CIO said he send an email over to the server guys as soon as he got it.

481,We need to talk about taxes,"Hi everyone!  LTL FTP, the usual... 

Not too sure if this tale fits here, as it is technically not ""tech support"" I was providing, but was mostly explaining how tech actually works or not works... If you like this, I got tons more.

Disclaimer: I am not actually tech support, but handle all cloud computing topics for a startup, from the ETL processes to the DBs and writing up the queries other departments use to actually utilize the massive amount of data we collect. Technically I do this because nobody else can, my officially a ""Product Manager""

Bit of background of the company:

We market browser and mobile apps that are free, but allow users to spend money on premium services. our products are available all over the world and are used by a lot of people. Company has been around for some 8 years. I've been working here for over 7 years now and, apart from the CEO and one finance guy, have been with the company the longest.

This tale took place in late 2014. Since we are an EU based company and do all our business online we were dealing with some VAT (value added tax) changes that would come into effect January first 2015 for all EU members. Basically what the the changes entailed was that we could no longer slap the VAT of our home country on all our sales and report to our tax authority anymore. Instead we'd have to determine where someone lives based on a list of criteria (which were not specified), and pay the VAT of their home country instead.

Cue the actors for one of the most infuriating meetings I have ever had to attend:

**$Me**: take a guess          
**$HOF**: Our head of finance, generally clueless about technology though she worked in tech companies all her life          
**$PTL**: Pregnant Tax Lady, our tax adviser, probably 8 months pregnant at the time, thinks the internet is some kind mystical mumbo jumbo. Has worked with us for 3+ years at this point.          
**$DPG** Data Protection Guy, cued in via phone because I demanded him to listen in. Knows his stuff but makes things way too complicated most of the time. (getting paid per hours must be nice)


Discussions were already underway.
&gt; **$HOF**: So, we need those criteria to figure out which country people are from, which ones should we use **$PTL**?

&gt; **$PTL**: Easiest would be to use their address, that is more than enough.

&gt; **$Me**: Like IP address?

&gt; **$PTL**: No their physical address.

&gt; **$Me**, sighing internally: We don't have that in 99% of the cases, as we do not ship physical goods. Would the IP also work?

&gt; **$PTL**: What's an IP address?

... she has worked with us, an online company for 3+ years... I explain it in as simple terms as I can.

&gt; **$PTL**: Hmm, maybe, but is that accurate?

&gt; **$Me**: As long as nobody uses a VPN, fairly accurate yes.

... cue me trying to explain what a VPN is for some 10 minutes until DPG chimes in.

&gt; **$DPG**: I just checked and we cannot store the IP address for that matter.

... long discussion with me suggesting things that might actually work, always getting shut down by **$DPG** or **$PTL** for reasons beyond my comprehension. Meeting has been dragging on for close to 1.5 hours at this point.

&gt; **$Me**: Okay, what else we got... I could use the Random_kpi1, currency paid and cross reference that with the payment provider chosen. We also let people choose the ""server"" they want to connect to which technically represents a country. That makes the minimum of four criteria we need for this, right?

**$PTL** just looked at me for a moment, I was 99% certain she did not understand anything I had just said.

&gt; **$PTL**: Yes, that sounds good.

Some typing and mumbling can be heard from **$DPG**

&gt; **$DPG**: Sounds good to me, no data protection issues with that.

I give HOF a long look, wondering if she realized I was basically grasping for straws by now. The criteria I stated are basically anything from conclusive for determining where somebody lives. But hey, **$DPG** had shut down anything I came up with that would have been conclusive by saying we could not do that because of Data Protection laws.

I just want this to be over with and get to work on the actual problem by now, so people stop asking me when it will be done (yes, before the how is decided....)

&gt; **$HOF**: Great! Seems like we finally have a way to do this! Think you can write all of that up **$Me** and send it to **$PTL** and **$DPG** so we can get written confirmation that this is a valid process?

... She looked at me, and I realized she also had no clue what I just said.

&gt; **$Me**: Sure thing, you'll have it in an hour.

... Unable to believe just what happened I write out the email and send it off. Sure enough the next week I get confirmation. Mail gets forwarded to investors to show we are working on stuff. Investors gets interested in process. Big Auditing Girm gets hired to have a look at the processes we build. They take 2 weeks to go through all of it, interviewing me (telling them the data is fairly arbitrary and not really 100% accurate) and the analytics guys (telling them the same). 

Surprisingly, they got no complaints whatsoever. We get official letters signing off on the process and I begin implementation. 

This system has been in production since late 2014, with minor tweaks. It's accepted by all European tax bodies we report to and we have passed every financial audit thrown at us so far. The analytics guys and I still cannot believe that we actually got through all this given the nature of the data passed along.

482,Permanent Fixture,"Just want to say right off the bat, I'm not a Tech worker.

This happened a few years ago while I was still substitute teaching.  

One of the teachers I subbed for frequently would constantly unplug the dock for her school laptop and carry it around with her, laptop still attached.  This required her to unplug all of the cables from the back, such as the ones hooked up to the smart board, the teacher only portions of the school network, printers, ect.  But she could never remember which plug went where when she needed to hook everything back up.  Apparently IT had come in several times to reconnect everything, a few of them when I was covering her class.  There was frequent grumbling about having to do this time and again, and by the mid part of the year, they even glued a diagram of what went where to her desk.  

So one day I come in to her class to teach biology, and you could smell the metal and plastic.  It seems IT had come in and made a few modifications to her work station.  The dock now had brackets attached to it, and was bolted down with large 3/4 inch bolts, and the cables were all in, and sealed in a thick layer of caulk.  There was a note.

484,Dual Monitors,"Background: IT Manager (read:only IT) at a medical practice with many, many doctors and specialties). 


At the request of one of our dentists, I set up TV screens in every patient room to act as both TVs and secondary monitors where the doctor can show the patient images, such as Xrays. To facilitate this, I connected each TV to each computer via HDMI as a second monitor, and purchased Hulu with live TV.


The job of the assistants is to, in the morning, open up Hulu via a desktop shortcut, and then pick whatever the patient wants to watch (invariably either ESPN or masterchef reruns). Relatively simple, and they all know how this works. Where I ran into problems is with the dual monitor set up itself. 


Today, I had the following conversation with one of the assistants:


$A: “This computer’s mouse doesn’t work. I don’t see the arrow. ”


$me: “Well, it’s on the second monitor. Just move the mouse all the way to the right like I told you to and you should see the pointer.” (I can’t just lock the cursor to one of the monitors because that involves hotkeys to lock and unlock the cursor, and they have no idea how to use that)


$A: “I did that. Still can’t see it.”


So this I have to see. You know, that wierd tingly feeling you get sometimes when you know you’re about to see a mindboggling display of computer illiteracy? Yeah I got that. I get up from my comfy office chair and go down 3 flights of stairs to take a look.


I get there, and she tells me it’s all good, and that the doctor helped her out. So ask what happened. 


$A: “I was moving the mouse to the right.”


$me: “That’s what I told you to do.”


$A: “yeah, but you didn’t tell me to drag it. I just picked up the mouse and moved it as far to the right as I possibly could. I even undid the velcro that makes its wire shorter.”


I’m reconsidering the hotkey idea. Maybe that’ll actually make things easier.

485,Substitute teacher teaches me that teaching teachers to teach technology isn't too terrible,"I work IT support at a primary school and, due to some previous experience teaching, have been helping teach digital technologies with some of the less technology-confident teachers, along with the dedicated digital technology teacher. 


Most of the teachers are responding really well to this, and have really tried to take the opportunity to improve their own knowledge, but by the end of the semester they were all a bit stressed and just over the whole thing. This is a short story about the substitute teacher that was a breath of fresh air on a difficult day. 


After teaching a lot of computer basics last term we moved on to some Scratch projects. The kids were pretty excited about this and we spent a few weeks on it. 

By the end it was getting a bit tedious but the kids enthusiasm helped keep us going.

On one of the last days we were teaching one of the hardest parts and I happened to be the lone IT technician that day as my coworkers were away. This meant I had to pop in and out a lot to make sure I was on top of everything else too. This made for an extra stressful day. 


It was the last class of the day and we'd already had these kids before lunch for an hour. Their teacher had left for the day thus we had a substitute teacher (ST) helping us for the rest of the day. 

As the kids are coming in, we talk to the ST and hand her the instructions, 16 pages long. This is usually when the teacher flips through it, gives us a confused look before saying they probably won't be much help. 


Today was different, I pointed out which pages we were working on today. ST had a bit of a read and after a little she said ""I have no idea what you're doing or what this program is, but I can read and follow instructions!""


Never had we had a more helpful teacher, we got though all we needed to and more. The kids listened and enjoyed themselves. ST seemed to have fun and learnt a thing or two too.


Tl;dr: After a hard day teaching Scratch programming, a substitute teacher says she can read and follow instructions, proceeds to be exceedingly helpful in teaching Scratch programming for the rest of the day, despite a lack of knowledge.

487,The restaurant POS,"To begin, I feel a bit out of my depth making a post here. My skills in your field are mediocre at best, I have not been to school and been trained, nor have I held a job in the industry.

That being said, I have had a few wacky experiences trying to help friends, family, co workers and in a few exceptional cases did what I might call 'consulting' for discounts or gift cards from businesses, as I sometimes found myself on friendly terms with people who had absolutely no idea what they were doing. This is one of the latter stories, and as requested I've decided to make a post out of it.

Sometime ago, my favorite restaurants owner asked me to look at their register. Their POS terminal was glitchy, and no longer covered by the company they'd bought it from - that company wanted them to pay for a new subscription for software and totally new machines for what seemed to be shockingly absurd amounts of cash. Googling showed that the company was now devoted 'to the cloud' and had 'upgraded' everything to keep all of your data on their servers.

So I dug into trying to figure out what exactly could be done about this. The hardware they had was very old, custom made, and the software was mated to it. The thing ran on top of some version of windows XP, - fortunately this was while XP still had support - but there was no guarantee that it'd actually function if I imaged the disk and stuffed it onto a new machine. I wasn't able to find almost anything out about the hardware nor the software that ran on it - the company had kept things very close to the chest and did *not* like anyone modifying anything, ever.

The hired help and owner kept talking about how the software required a server to run everything which is why it had to have an internet connection. Putting 2+2 together in my head made me realize this thing might be validating the license vs the hardware, so if I touched anything at all, even if I tested a new machine with an image of the old one, it might break for both new AND old machines permanently.

So I decided lets NOT touch the black box full of magic yet, and ask some stupid questions.

First, what exactly did this register *do* and why was it so critical? Couldn't they just replace it with another company's (possibly) less insanely expensive product?  Turned out this wasn't simply a pretty register. It handled all the scheduling for the employees, kept track of all of the things the business needed to buy and all of their sales, and *absolutely everything they had ever done*.

Second, where is this mysterious server that they kept talking about, as if we could find *it* and find out what *it* was running, we could find something that might work with it instead of the glitchy POS. I got confused stares and shrugs. Nobody knew *what* a server was, just that it had been a requirement along with an internet connection for the POS. So I walked the cord from the POS through the store to the... DSL modem?!

Residential DSL. And it's the *only* wired connection. Boggling, I ask around if they've got any computers they keep on all the time, maybe in a closet or closed space - nope. Owner owns two laptops they give to his kids, hired help uses phones and they allow customers to use the wifi. The question nagged at me, the POS terminal had to be saving its data *somewhere* - but if it was just a terminal where is the server?

One night they allowed me to watch as they shut everything down, and showed me how they did the nightly backup. Which... They canceled. I objected and asked them why they cancelled it, and they explained they had to. They cancelled it because the subscription was expired, and so they were no longer allowed to backup the database to the *server*.

&amp;nbsp;

Aiee! I'd found the mysterious server I was looking for was right in front of me. The terminal *wasn't* a terminal at all - it held *everything* important. There are **NO** backups!

Although I tried to explain, the owner couldn't understand why cancelling the backup every single day meant they *had* no backup. He had no plan, and mocked the idea that the register was going to eventually fail saying that he'd have to shut down the business if that happened. Worse, he wouldn't stop the employees from web browsing ON THE POS. I started paying with cash only after that.

Even before I found out the POS was where all the important data was, I did *NOT* want to mess with the thing, but now I absolutely wasn't going to. I told him outright I wouldn't even try and that he needed to either cough up the cash for the new contract, or get someone familiar with the software and hardware to figure out a better solution.

The owner chose to do nothing.

488,"Last year my boss had the idea of using a flashdrive for a VOIP phone server harddrive. Drive died this week. 4:15pm call, returned home by 1:20pm.","**Update/Correction:** Due to my goofup of the title, it was not until 1:20pm the next day, it was 1:20am the next day, in the morning, night has already set, and in bed by 2am. For all those who wonder, against the opportunity my boss gave me of sleeping in, I still went to work the next morning.

I work in a (small) computer and network, management and repair, shop. About a dozen of us, nine of us actually techs. We're not in a big city, or big town, just big enough to have a college and a few restaurants, so we travel a lot for clients (home visits or companies), when we absolutely can't do it via remote desktop.

My role, besides general computer support and projects, is VOIP work. Other than my boss, I'm the go to guy. I've been asking for an assistant at least. We setup clients with a server that manages all their voip (network based) phones in their building, with a couple clients that use a vpn with their phones for their satellite (other towns) locations. The server then connects to a voip service to use with one or more phone numbers.

Not counting this week, the last two weeks I had installed two new phone servers, one of which included new phones, while the client reused their old VOIP phones (their previous VOIP provider was, well...), which I had the luxery of reprogramming each on site during install, majority of the server OS install and setup is done in house. Before the two installs for about a year, I've been working on other installed phone systems. Occasional requested changes, answering questions, fixing issues, and updating the systems. About this time last year was our previous server install and setup, and one the year before. Frequency of installing systems is not that great. Normally it takes about a couple weeks after a system install for the dust to clear and change requests come to a crawl for each client.

*Now for the fun part of the story.*

I get a call at 4:15pm. One of our older clients calls about their phone system. It was installed two to two and a half years ago, then replaced with a new machine a year later due to hardware issues. Their calls were coming in and out just fine in the morning, acting strange the afternoon until they couldn't make calls, then once it cleared up, they gave us a call. 

After an hour of trying to remote into the system, same method I've always had, I couldn't get a webpage to load up, or SSH to go beyond asking a username, just instant disconnect. Confirmed with our network firewall techs that I'm not being blocked or the like. Contacted the client and asked if they could force a reboot the system, as I wasn't able to from our end. 15 minutes later, everything was still down. Network switch shown the server's port was in use, so the system was on, at least, but now no ping responses or ssh login prompt.

My boss insisted someone to go out and take a look, as the client does international sales, and their day begins at 7am. So after an hour drive, and boss covered for my dinner (subway) which I ate on the way there, I'm on site and see the odd, PBX runs on linux by the way, error on screen, and I couldn't do anything to move it along. After another failed reboot, I booted it up in an environmental ubuntu, and checked the health of the drive.

&gt; *Oh ya!* My boss had the wild idea last year to use a flash drive for quicker system upgrades and swap outs in the future. Three bad blocks (sections of data) on the 8GB drive.

Discussed the issue with my boss, we toss around ideas, and gave in with the idea of installing a new drive, which was not brought, and at least get the basics out of the way. This is now 7pm. Go to a nearby walmart and pick up a TEMP flash drive, and get the OS installed on it.

At this time, I am glad I keep two flash drives with me. One with general tools (bunch of diagnostic software), and a multiboot drive (many ISOs of OS installations and environmental OSes). No need to waste time downloading the OS installation off the net and finding another flash drive or disc.

After visiting the nearby walmart, and swinging by a coworker's house, per boss's request to save time for tomorrow, to pick up some equipment unrelated. I return back to the client at 930pm. Flash drives in hand. Begin the installation, wasted half an hour troubleshooting the initial installation setup, and got the very basics going for them. 

All they now have is incoming calls rings all phones, the construction garage ringer, and a cordless phone. Nothing fancy, no time controls, interaction menus, no voicemail to email. Finished by midnight, home by 1:20am. Roughly a 15 hour day.

At this time, we are working on a schedule to go back on site, install a real drive, HDD or SSD, install the OS, and configure as needed. Will have to be in the evening, again. Luckily, if I can copy over from the flash to the new drive (backup and restore), I can save time and get them going the same way, and finish and fine tune the day, to a week.",False,138,35,LigerXT5,talesfromtechsupport

$maint - electrical monkey  
$eng - one of many superior beings that demand we never touch their stuff  
  
**The Setup** - on my last work day during a weekend shift, we start getting a couple of power alarms on the facility panel.  This place took their reliability seriously enough to get a UPS system, closet full of batteries, generator, the full kit.  The alarm indicates some electrical noise.  Nothing critical.  Alarm recorded to be passed on to $maint during the work week.  
  
**The Plot** - I come back in after a few days have passed.  Facility power still has an alarm on it, I follow up with management and get notified the UPS has a fault and vendor will be in today.  Work goes on, as usual.  $coworkers are running the usual morning backups.  Vendor shows up later in the morning, $maint in tow to supervise.  
  
From what I pieced together later, it went down like this.  The UPS was put into bypass and worked on.  The vendor found a faulty capacitor that was the cause of the dirty power alarms.  Capacitor replaced.  In theory, fine, right?  Well, I don't know how electrical is supposed to work, but they didn't test the replaced capacitor.  In fact, they just tested it... by throwing the switch and taking it off bypass, $maint nodding the whole way.  
  
It worked.  For ten whole seconds.  Then the whole building went black.  Everything.  Every light, every server, every router, phones, workstations, the big db system, all dead.  
  
$coworkers jaws hit the floor.  I perform the facepalm required by cliche.  
  
This isn't even the part that kills me.  
  
**The Punchline** - Our team takes a few minutes to get our shock and laughter out of the way.  We definitely choose not to wander over and pester $maint or vendor, figuring all the important people are about to descend in storm and fury soon enough, and we're safer over here with a quieter day ahead of us.  
  
Surprisingly slowly, one of the developers finally comes in to see what's going on, checks with us, gets our brief summary, then goes over to pester $maint.  $eng comes in shortly after and beelines over to me.  
  
$eng: What happened?  
$me: Vendor was working on the UPS, I'm not sure of the specifics, but clearly something went wrong.  
  
And then, with all the assurance of someone who has clearly not taken enough stock of the situation...  
  
$eng: We need to send out an email.  
  
He was three long steps from the completely dead email server, and surrounded by our clearly nonfunctional workstations, and *in the dark because the lights were out*.  
  
I don't recall if I gave him a beat to reconsider that, or if there was a grand spread of arms to take it in, because my mouth simply overrode my brain, and just spouted a flabbergasted...  
  
$me: ""On WHAT?!""  
$eng: *blink*, *blink*, *180 spin and hasty retreat back to office*  
  
$coworkers, like a good troop, waited for him to get through a door and then fell over laughing.  
  
The $VP comes in two minutes later and outlines a plan for us to call out and notify all our remote customers of the failure as soon as the phone system, likely the quickest to recover and easiest to verify, can boot back up.  I get, in hindsight, that $eng really wanted some way to reach out... but, no, it still just breaks my brain.  
  
Vendor managed to find a third part to swap in and data center was repowered maybe 15 minutes later.  Once we could, remote offices were contacted ASAP to let them know why all their apps were down and would continue to be down a bit while we got everything checked out.  I was not talked to for insubordination or pointing out the obvious, this time.

&amp;nbsp;  
Field guys have hired a new person, sales/untrained tech; he calls because he can't log into the laptop.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Trying to reset his password, I figure out that nobody's even told HR so there's no details of this person anywhere in the company let alone an AD user; the guy that's just hired him has just gone on leave for 2 weeks, he's just tagging along with another freshie until he gets back.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm sitting next to HR, so we figure out who his supervisor is based on leave requests, and find the subordinate that just left for which this person is most certainly going to be a replacement (Also confirmed that the mobile number he called on was the number allocated to the person that left). All I need at the moment is his name and I can get HR to fill in a blank entry to kick processes into gear.

503,The mystery security-alarm trigger,"This isn't my story, it's one I read in a magazine maybe 30 years ago, so please forgive any slips of memory.

A security alarm technician was assigned to fix a customer's home system that would trigger without warning. This alarm system would start screeching and doing it's thing even if people were home and it was disabled.

The technician attended, couldn't find anything wrong with the sensors or control unit, and went away. This happened again-and-again. The tech started replacing each component. Eventually, he'd replaced every sensor and control unit but the issue remained. The home-owner was not too happy, but was willing to stick with this system until it worked properly (clearly, customers were a lot more understanding 30 years ago).

Over time, the tech noticed a pattern. This seemed to occur mostly on Friday and Saturday evenings.

Finally, the technician decides to perform some RFI scans - just on the possibility a neighbor is using something that is causing the alarm to trigger. He stakes-out the house on a Friday night and runs his scans.

He discovers a take-away food shop about 400 metres down the road. The tech walks into the shop and his scanner is showing levels like you wouldn't believe.

This take-away shop has a microwave oven. The tech can see staff are putting things in and taking them out while the door to the microwave stays open. The oven ran continously.

The owner of the shop had disabled the door interlock on their microwave oven so they wouldn't have to keep opening and shutting the door, as this was slowing down food preparation.

504,"That time the network was broken, I fixed it twice, then broke it some more.","This story is quite lengthy and is mainly networking focussed. Anybody who has read my previous TFTS posts knows although I work 2nd line support I also did Dev work, as well as this, being the only hardware tech in the office and our infrastructure being based 300 miles away meant I was also the most qualified to set up PC's and manage the local network.

We operate in a managed office, so we share a building with other businesses, although we run our own network. We have our own network here which is connected to our HQ in London, however the building handles our phone lines. All our PCs and desks run to the local comms room, where they are patched into 2 x 28 port switches.

Our phonelines require 1 direct connection to the switch, while the PCs can daisy chain or hook into a smaller switch which we keep under the desks. We have some local kit like fileserver, dns and firewall but we ultimately tunnel our connection, while the rest of the building operates on a different setup altogether, most importantly however, we all operate on the same physical lines.

I know a few of you are already starting to itch at how bad this all sounds, trust me I've tried to get our infra to improve this - however since I am *not part of the team* my advice is often ignored.

This story is probably a strong example of *why* they thought this, having rewrote the tale from my youth I realise I took a lot of unnecessary risks, came to a lot of incorrect conclusions, and while ultimately the blame didn't rest with me; I made a lot of actions which made things both better and worse.

I guess the main point of my tale is that everybody who did know better than me was eager to place the blame at my feet and tell me they weren't getting involved - even when that was exactly their job, but I digress. Here is the tale of the time I broke the buildings network.

**Friday**

So one fine Friday afternoon we are setting up for some new employees starting on Monday. Our new desks arrive and the entire office joins forces to shut down, shift the new desks and set up the new computers. I have some tasks to set up some new hubs under the desks and hook in the new phone-lines, I take the opportunity to catalogue which floor ports are in use so that I can try and clear some space on the switch, with over 30 employees requiring phones and desktops, as well as printers and other devices we were starting to run short on space.

After each desk is moved I mark each floor port in use, whether it's a phone or a desktop, then in the sever room I change the cable to the switch, blue for phone and grey for data. Afterwards I marvel at the cleanliness of it, each connection is clearly catalogued so we can trace from PC to floor port to switch port - and vice versa. Everybody is online, everybody logs into their phones, the office is ready for new staff - everybody pats themselves on the back and heads home for the weekend.

**Monday**

I come into work to more or less complete chaos. Nobody has access to the internet, those who do have access to the internet can't access our servers. I log into my PC and do some diagnosis. My machine connects to the internet and I ping our servers with no response. I try to ping the server by direct IP and this works for some reason. I check my IP and notice I'm not on our network, but one belonging to the building.

I go to a few of those who can't connect to the internet and check their DNS settings, the DNS is unreachable and I try changing it over to a google DNS - which works. Okay so maybe our DNS is down - I go to see the building manager and ask if there were any power issues over the weekend. He tells me that there was a powercut in the area on Sunday night, but that we were supposedly unaffected.

With my limited knowledge of networking I start to form a theory in my head - there was a small powercut or a surge, our DHCP has gone offline and come back up but has been reset - so it's not allocating IP's - some of us are therefore finding a route to the next DHCP it can find, which is the buildings.

I go back to my desk and try to access our DHCP server, I'm asked for a password and decide to try some basics like ""changeme"" or ""admin"". Remarkably one of those work and I'm met with the client listing. I can see a number of devices from our office, the ones which can connect - the IP range, subnet and gateway are all wrong - I call up our Infra team and let them know our findings, as well as make sure I'm on the right thinking. They agree that resetting the DHCP back to it's settings is probably good, agreeing that a power surge or power cut probably reset it.

I set the DHCP settings - connection comes back for everybody in the office, servers visible. Everybody pats me on the back and we all get back to work.

**Tuesday**

I arrive at the office and am greeted by the Building Manager at his desk on the phone, as I walk through the door and smile at him I hear him say ""2 moments he's just walked through the door"". **Well that can't be good.** He tells me that nobody in the building can see their servers and are having intermittent connections, and that when he rang up our office to tell us about the outage they had told him that not only was their network fine; it was thanks to me messing around with the network yesterday.

He calls me over to his desk and asks me to speak to the buildings network engineers, who are a remote company and reluctant to send out an engineer to come take a look. I explain the situation; that our offices connection went down and we believe it was due to a power cut. The remote engineer agrees that I may be on the right lines, but changing settings on our own equipment shouldn't impact the rest of the building; although they might have had similar issues with power and he would check the rest of the equipment remotely to ensure it was configured.

I go to our office and everybody is sat working happily - our network is running smoothly. I let everybody know whats going on in the building, then get on with my job.

At around lunch the Building Manager comes to the office and asks me to look at his PC. We go down and he's trying to remote to a server, the server is unreachable. I run a quick ipconfig and notice something awful. **He has one of our IPs.**

Then it clicks into place. I hadn't modified our DHCP to have the correct settings; I had changed the entire building's DHCP server to force everybody onto our network. I imagine my face probably turned a lovely shade of green. I quickly (and I meant really f\*\*king quickly) reverted the settings on the DHCP server I was on yesterday. People in the rest of the building started to reconnect to their services, which some of our offices machines started disconnecting at random. 

This was bizarre. We weren't automatically being put onto our network and were in fact connecting directly to the buildings wider network. But our network was still there, and we could ping our servers but only when we forced our clients to use our direct IP details, furthermore the rest of the building could suddenly do the same, and we were on the verge (probably far over the verge) of a data breach.

Thankfully there was a team of engineers on site who ran their own networking business (but didn't do networking for the buildings). $BM asked if they'd take a look and they'd asked me to come along. After a lengthy wander around the whole building, they asked me if we'd recently changed our floor ports. I told them about the work I'd done on cleaning up on unused space. They told me the building uses a spanning tree protocol and that there can't be any loops in the network.

I was tasked with once again ripping up our floor ports, remapping the whole lot and ensuring that nothing plugged in was plugged in anywhere else. I went through all of our floor ports, all of our switch ports, til I was happy there were no loops - it was 9pm and I checked my desktop. The network was offline completely. There was nothing more I could do that day, I was exhausted and figured I'd go to sleep early, be in before everybody else the next day and figure it out.

**Wednesday (Final Day of outage)**

I come in at 7am (that was early for me) as we established the day before, the building's network was fine, ours was not. I try a few solutions I thought of over the last few hours but to no avail. My colleagues started to filter in at 8:30, some being understanding of the outage and others asking me when I'd fix it. Tired of pointing out I didn't actually cause the outage I just started trying to get in touch with anybody who knew more about the network than I did. Our Infrastructure denied all knowledge of anything being wrong, as one point asserting they never even set up the physical network and only handled configuration. Our Building Manager put me in touch with the remote network engineers who were singing the same tune, that we set up the physical network and they just handled configuration. Completely lost for solutions I started trying to set up contingency, we had some small WiFi hotspots, since they couldn't hold more than a few clients, I decided we would connect 1 PC to the hotspot, and bridge the rest of the connection through the hubs. It wasn't pretty but it'd get us online and we could use our VPN as if we were ""working from home"".

I disconnected each hub from the floor ports as I didn't want the building network to interfere and set up the first bank of desks. The plan worked, everybody connected to the internet and started to connect to the VPN. I got to the second bank of desks and disconnected the hub from the floor port. No sooner had that been done than people started to shout about the networking being back. In my head I started to curse. That wasn't a coincidence. I asked somebody to connect to a random website to ensure it wasn't cached data. Not just people on this bank, the entire office was back online.

I plugged the cable I had just unplugged back in. The network fell once more. I remembered the local Network guy from yesterday saying to me ""Make sure there are no loops"". I checked the floor port, 3 phone lines and 1 data connection, the data connection went to the hub, and 7 more cables came out. Wait? 7? There are 6 computers and 1 connection to the switch, so why are there 8 cables plugged in? I asked each person to tell me when windows said their network cable was unplugged, each one called out until 1 cable did nothing. I followed it, it went around the entire bank of desks, back around a desk leg, into *another* *separate floor port*. What's more is that the floor port it was plugged into mapped to the other switch in our cabinet. Making a perfect little loop in our Spanning Tree.

The fault wasn't with anybody really. When everybody pitched in moving the desks on Friday somebody had spotted a spare data cable and thought they were being helpful plugging it back into the floor.

So there you have it, a 3 day outage brought to and end, by unplugging a single 5m cat 5e cable. A cable that managed to bring down an entire buildings network. I reported my findings to everybody concerned, our local infra blamed the buildings topology. The building engineers blamed our local infra, the engineers who helped out were happy it was resolved and everybody in our office continued to blame me for touching it in the first place.

I was quite happy to put on some music, and start dealing with some regular user issues.

Much needed TL;DR: entire buildings network goes down because we accidentally plugged 2 switches into eachother",False,231,37,joeborder,talesfromtechsupport

A regular of ours came into the shop asking for one of our senior guys. She was in tears and we all came out to see what was wrong. It turns out that their families external HDD was dropped and was completely dead. Like dead-dead. It dawned on us what was coming. She explained that they had lost over 12+ years of family photos and videos… Jesus… 12+ years of baby photos all the way to tweenagers for their 2 kids, grandparents who were no longer with us, beloved family pets no longer with us… it was pretty awful. 

We didn’t have the kit in store to attempt a recovery like that. So, we had it shipped off to a trusted dedicated recovery company to give it a shot. Unfortunately, that drive was donezo. We broken the news to the couple and they we understandably distraught. As I had taken over dealing with them I suggested a few things.   


$ME: Do you have any other external drives or USBs lying around that you may have saved stuff to.

$Customer: \*Sobs\* No nothing  
 (The poster children for the importance of regular backups right here)

$ME: What about CDs/DVDs?

$Customer: No

$ME: “aww jeeeez rick”… Hmmm how about old laptops or PCs? We built you a new machine last year, didn’t we?

$Customer: Oh yeah, we have 2 old laptops in the shed but they’re dead too.

$ME: Sweet, it’s a long shot but bring them in and I’ll have a look.  


The customer brought in the laptops the same day and I spent the afternoon taking them apart and retrieving the 2.5” drives.

BOOM! Sure enough, the 2nd laptop had a working drive (barely. It was making some odd noises). I wasted no time cloning the drive to a new drive and started sifting through all the data… It’s all there… well most of it. Scattered in random folders in Documents/Pictures/Desktop and a storage partition. The pictures went back to about 2008 and the latest we had was 2017. I organized it all onto 1 folder and backed it up in their client file on our server. We made the call as a group announcing the good news. It was the best feeling. They purchased 2 new external drives from us and we loaded on all their organized data free of charge. (only charged for the drives).

After all that they got back about 60&amp;#37;-70&amp;#37; of the total lost data, but all the important sentimental stuff was there, and they couldn’t be happier.

507,Tales from Aircraft Maintenance: The End of an Era,"Many years ago, I was an Air Force avionics technician. I had some very interesting experiences while in uniform, some of them I can even share with all of you. This story is of the day that was the beginning of the end of my Air Force career. 

[As mentioned in this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8ozx2m/tales_from_aircraft_maintenance_sort_of_tank_you/), I was injured on the job which resulted in my permanent transition into civilian life and a much better life (it took a while to get here too) as an IT guy.

It was an oppressively hot day (triple digits hot) on the flight line of $deployedlocation, otherwise known as a normal day at $deployedlocation. I had returned to working on jets just days before and was longing for my semi-comfortable previous job running comms at our command post. The days were shorter and didn’t require me to bake in the direct sun or worse in the large and even hotter aluminum cylinders known as C-17’s. I was “lucky” this day, I was working night shift. I am always happier at night. It’s not so bright out, nor does everything metal require thick leather gloves to be touched.

Shift begins and I grab my tool kit and other equipment and head out to the ramp for the first of three landers I will be working that night. I perform all my checks on the generator and AC unit for the jet and do my FOD walk. Once the prep is done, I sit on the Hobart and definitely did not take a nap for about 30 minutes while waiting for my jet.

My radio goes off, announcing “my jet” is on approach as is another jet that is declaring some kind of issue, effectively this call amounts to one step shy of an inflight emergency (IFE). With this call, the fire department and medical are soon standing by just in case. The pilot was vague in his call out.

Fast forward about 15 minutes, my jet is on the ground, parked in its spot and ready to be serviced. I get to work. The first task is to make sure nothing fell off in flight or looks like it will next time it flies. As I am performing my task, I notice the “follow me” car leading the IFE jet into a spot next to mine. I also notice that there is a generator sitting there right about where the inboard engine (#3) would hit it. The driver of the follow me does not see me waving like a crazy person or the generators. 

Bad things are about to happen.

I turn on my marshalling wands and signal the pilot to spot, the jet continues to taxi towards the Hobart. About 100 yards to go. After I realize that the jet isn’t going to stop, I run as fast as I could to move the power cart. Of course this is one of the Hobarts with stuck brakes (about half were stuck). I put my back into it (literally) and push this thing out of the way.

Completely out of breath from pushing the cart, I collapse on the ground in time to watch the nonresponsive jet taxi past. Moments later, my adrenaline wears off and I feel immense pain in my abdomen. I proceed to collapse on the ground and curl into a ball hoping for a quick death, just to make this pain stop.

I was found a few hours later next to that power cart when shift change occurred. After my coworkers were done giving me sh- a hard time for laying around all shift, I am loaded on to that very same jet that had just taxi’d in. It was a medevac mission on its way back to the states and I was on it.

Within 8 weeks, I had my hernia surgery and was back to work. Day 3 back at work, I push another power cart and get another hernia in the same spot, nearly the exact same way. I found out later that the doc who did my first surgery was lazy and went in the easy way. Surgery two, the doc did it right, but it was too late. Permanent nerve damage. I haven’t worked on a jet since that day.

509,A tale of cell signal and breaker panels,"Long time lurker, not quite first time poster (I have like two or three stories here, but they're very old). This is a short one that goes back around a year or two and of which I was reminded of by a friend's misadventure. It is not technically tech support, although I ended up solving a weird problem that affected quite a few users, none the least myself.

I'm a CompSci student, hoping to someday become a sysadmin or DevOps dude. I'm also in dire need of a job, since literally everything available in my region is outside of my skillset (I'm not good at front-end development). Basically, my whole building knows that if a computer needs to be fixed, my door is one to be knocked on, mostly because I don't leave that often.

One day, I am interrupted from ~~browsing Reddit~~ important schoolwork by a new tenant from one of the apartments. She says she no longer has any cell signal, and came to me because I'm known to be ""good with computers"". I politely explain that I have neither experience nor access to the nearest cell tower, and to wait a few days to see if the situation improves.

A few hours later, a different person knocks on my door. This one I know, though, but he has the same issue, no cell reception. I give him the same answer and send him on his way.

Half an hour later, another tenant. Then another one. Then someone from the building across the street from mine. All receive the same answer from me. At this point, I (FINALLY) check my phone; no signal either. I figure that it can't be tower related, as we have coverage from at least two towers (at the time, I think there are four nowadays), but, unable to do anything about it, decide to call my phone service provider the next day from school.

Later that day/evening, the power to the entire building is cut. A quick glance out the window reveals that it's not a blackout, every building in the street has power except mine. I go down to the basement to check on the panel, and find... nothing. The breaker flipped for apparently no reason. I flip it back on, and go back to ~~attempting to make sense of some C#~~ watching Twitch. Not ten minutes later, the power goes out again.

I make my way downstairs, but again, nothing strange about the breaker. Except that it was off of course. I turn it on, then decide to stay for a bit, see what happens.

Five minutes later, one of my neighbors (different than all the previous ones) shows up, intent on turning the breaker off. What follows is a bit fuzzy in my head (you will understand why in a minute), but basically, he explained to me that he needed to turn off the electricity to prevent the government from spying on him through the magnets they hid in his walls. Or in other words: my neighbor went insane.

I just nodded along, feigning understanding his ranting, and let him cut the power. I then went out for a smoke, far enough as to get cell signal to call the cops. An hour later, they show up, and promptly escort him to an ambulance. Then one of the cops comes to speak to me.

&gt;$cop: By the way, have any of you had cell reception trouble lately ?  
&gt;$me: Actually yeah ! Why do you ask ?
&gt;
&gt;*$cop produces a large-ish homebrew device. Based on the context, I guess it was a signal jammer of some sort.*
&gt;
&gt;$cop: We found this inside his apartment.  
&gt;$me: The hell ? What is this guy doing with a signal jammer ?  
&gt;$cop: Says he needed it to ""cleanse the air"" or whatever. Might not be the only one around.  

It wasn't. The insane neighbor made at least two of them, one of which he somehow hooked up to the closer of the (then-)two cell towers, and it definitely looks like he was going for the second. I'm not sure of what happened to him after that...

**tl;dr:** Insane neighbor thinks the governement is spying on him with wall magnets (?!). Decides the most logical course of action is to jam cell signal and cut power to the entire building.

It was near 04:00 PM now and I was ready to take my fifteen minutes break of the afternoon, since we work in a ""IT Kiosk"" system (though we are in an open space... I know, it makes sense), one of us must always be here on site or take a company cellphone we have here and put a forward from the phone line of the IT support to the cellphone.

So taking the cellphone and heading to the cafeteria, I'd just pressed the button for the coffee on the machine when the cellphone started to ring.

&gt;$User: Yes hello, there is an emergency ! My laptop's screen is dead, it's entirely black. When I plug the laptop on the docking station, it displays properly on the monitor, on the desk, but on the laptop itself there is nothing !

514,"When Authentication Services Attack, or, What's My Password?","My environment is a mix-mash of aging crap that was set up wrong 10 years ago, aging crap that was set up wrong 5 years ago, and new crap that I set up (mostly) correctly. The REALLY old stuff has no concept of centralized account/password management. The old stuff is linked to AD for non-prod, but not for prod because my predecessors had NO idea how any of it works, and thought that they had to put servers in a different domain to get them to authenticate against AD in that domain. As a result, all of the really old stuff, as well as the old prod servers have individual accounts and passwords on them. If you login to one of those and change your password, it ONLY gets changed for THAT system.  

I built out a new dev, test, and QA environment for one of the dev teams. Due to a typo in the server template, /tmp got the wrong permissions. Now, when you login with AD, the kerberos portion creates a credentials cache file for you in /tmp where it keeps your ticket. With the bad permissions on /tmp, nobody but the superuser could create that file...so nobody but me could login. It took me less than 15 minutes to find and identify the problem, and 15 seconds to fix it.  

OPS opens a ticket stating that he can't login. My first thought is, ""Did I miss one of the servers?"" I check, and no, /tmp looks ok. I start checking logs...sometimes sssd will try and talk to the wrong AD server, but that's been mostly fixed, too. The logs report that the password is wrong. I tell him that he probably fat-fingered his password.  

\*""What password should I type?""\*  

Dude. Contrary to what the TV shows would have you believe, the SysAdmin has NO idea what your password is.  

""Uhhh...your AD password.""  

\*""Which AD password?""\*  

Now, to be fair, this is a valid question. My domain is separate from the corporate domain. But we've NEVER used corporate domain accounts to login. OPS knows this, though. Right? I ask when the last time he logged in to a domain-connected system was...he doesn't know what I mean. I figure I'll save some time and just reset his domain password. He's now able to login, is forced to change his password, and all is good.

\*""I can't login to $OLD\_PROD\_SERVER""\*  

""What's your local password on that system?""

""I don't know your password. When was the last time you logged in to this server?""  

\*""Yesterday. My password expired and I had to change it.""\*

Customer: now quite upset, starts yelling at me to come fix his electricity because ""We ran the wharrs"" 

Me: I begrudgingly start to open a ticket, whereas before I didn't even feel the need to log the call as it seemed like a wrong number. As I pull up more account information, I see that several set top boxes are up and functioning normally.
""Uh, it looks like your TV service is working, and I also see your data services are up and running too-- did your power come back on?""

Me: ""Oh, you mean the battery backup for your fiber services? Yes that's installed in your garage. But it seems to be working, I'm seeing a normal battery status from here, so the power must only be out for some of you outlets.""

This leads to me teaching a grown man about GFCI outlets, even though this has nothing to do with our service, all the while with him ranting about how our wharrz messed up his power.

Edit: 
By request, adding the resolution. I just asked questions regarding the outlets in his garage to see if any were GFCI. We found one with the button out, so I told him what that means-- that something shorted or faulted an electrical circuit, and all the outlets on that circuit would stop working. He found a crappy extension cord running through a part of his garage with a puddle. I recommended he unplug it before resetting the GFCI. He did so, then reset it. Power was restored to his garage, including to his garage door. He was actually very thankful and apologetic-- I don't remember the exact words but something to the effect of realizing it ""wasn't youenz whars after all.""

He responds back that it will not be possible but he will be over the next day if that is okay. I tell him it is.

The next day there is a knock on the door:

&gt; Me: Hi Jeff!

&gt; Jeff: Hi, thanks for helping me. Here is the machine.

Jeff hands me this very old laptop. Looks at least 15 years old and I look at it and see a sticker that has been torn off where i can make out ""avy"". 

&gt; Me: What operating system is this running?

&gt; Jeff: Windows 2000 NT (this story takes place in 2018).

&gt; Me (kinda excited): Wow! Really? Well lets see if we can make it work. What is the software you are trying to install?

Jeff: &lt;REDACTED NAME&gt;

&gt; Me: Never heard of it.

We get the computer started with no issues

&gt; Me: Is it this shortcut?

&gt; Jeff: Yes

I click on the shortcut where there is a radar on it. And I get an error message. I quickly figure out that the installation is wrong and I go through the process of reinstalling it. I will skip this part because it just trouble shooting and following 2 guides that are both right and wrong, but I get through it and gets the server started.

&gt; Me: There we go the server is started.

&gt; Jeff: Super, try the client.

I start the client and it pops up fine and suddenly I have a screen of my nations outline that looks like a RADAR picture and all surrounding contries. I look up on the task bar and see plane, boats, tanks, and nuke icons plus alot of other military looking things.

&gt; Me: Err... Jeff... What is this!?

&gt; Jeff: Ohh yeah, is it a program our army used to decifer radar signals and play out war scenarios. It has been decommisioned 10 years ago. I am going to use it for roleplaying games.

So what I have not said yet was that Jeff is a veteran and a highly ranking one at that. He somehow convinced the army/navy of my country to hand him a decommisioned tool that was used by our army for real and is now trying to use it for role playing games in a real world war 2 bunker where collages kids is going to see a scenario play out on a former real life war program, controlled by him.

&gt; Me: WOW! That is cool.

&gt; Jeff: That is not the best part. If I got it working, the army will provide me with a live feed from all radars of the country to get real life data.

&gt; Me: WHAT!?

&gt; Jeff: Cool right. Btw, can you install it on this old desktop to?

TLDR: I did family support for a family freind, expecting it to be just normal computer error. Instead I got to play with software used by the army/navy 10 years ago on an old windows NT machine that is going to be used in a roleplaying game in a real bunker 2 months from now, with live radar feed from my country!

Currently Jeff is sampling the system. If it goes okay I may have an update on how the role playing went in about 2-3 months as I might need to help them set it up.

*UPDATE*: I remembered wrong. Jeff did not get live feed. Jeff would get a CD with data taken from live feed where there was an ongoing drill happening with mock enemies and such, which dates back some years. So sorry for that confusion. I also talked to Jeff about releasing it online. He was not overly fond of the idea, even though the program has been declassified, so I will follow his feelings and not release it. I am sorry. I will however take some screenshots so you guys can see what the program looks like. I will posts these later today. 

*UPDATE 2*: Here is a screenshot of the program. I have covered up anything that would give away to many details. The maps is zoomed in to a local area. I added some object to it as good as I could. I have very basic knowledge from Jeff. I hope this is a good replacement instead of the actual program:

518,"Trial by Fire, in which a new tech deals with server failure","I've been in the IT business for nearly 10 years now, doing everything from helpdesk support, sys admin, some light programming and now database development. But my first job as an IT professional was an entry level support tech position for a small consulting firm. And my first couple of days on the job were exciting, to say the least. It's also the only time I've been grateful for cached Exchange mode.

Cast of characters:

**$hyacinth** : Me, fresh out of college.

**$boss**: My boss. A good guy who knows his stuff. 

**$firm**: Independent IT consulting firm I worked for.

**$exVendor**: Our (then) hosted Exchange vendor. They who control the servers control the emails.

**$largeClient**: One of the firms larger, Windows-using, clients. About 50 users.

I had just graduated from college and got hired at a small consulting firm. I was mainly hired due to my knowledge of Macs, as $firm had just taken on clients that used them. However, most of their clients used Windows which I had very little experience with and thus $firm was going to train me on. (This will be important later).

The first two days on the job (a Thursday and Friday) were taken up touring the various client's facilities and getting a look at their infrastructure, etc. Early Monday morning rolls around and I'm pretty excited. My first full day as a support tech! And then my phone rang....

&gt;**$boss**: $hyacinth, I need you to get down to $largeClient right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$hyacinth**: Um, okay. What's going on?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$boss**: $exVendor had a server failure last night and they haven't been able to restore from a backup yet. No one at $largeClient can access their email. Actually, most of our clients don't have email. We need all hands on deck. I'm on my way to help $otherClient. Call me when you get to $largeClient and I'll walk you through what you need to do.

So I hauled ass to $largeClient. I nervously walked in the door, introduced myself to the folks I hadn't met on Friday, and did my best to pretend like I knew what I was doing. Luckily they were cool people and were anxious but not panicking. Some of our other clients weren't as understanding. Anyway, I called $boss and he walked me through what to do, which involved going through a series of Outlook hoops. This was maybe the third time I'd ever used Outlook, so I had very little idea what the hell I was doing. But I muddled through with only a few terrified phone calls to $boss and more than a few stupid questions.  

About 3/4 of $firm's clients who used hosted Exchange happened to have their datastores on the $exVendor server that died. So we all spent the next two days dealing with our frustrated, panicky clients and trying to get everyone's mail back. But, you ask, why didn't $exVendor just restore the server from a backup? Ah, gentle reader, how I wish that had been possible. You see, as it turns out, $exVendor didn't have a viable, recent backup of the server that croaked. And in fact hadn't had a viable backup of that server for SIX MONTHS. Which we only found out when $boss kept pestering them and one of the $exVendor's support techs let that little tidbit slip out. Needless to say $firm switched our clients to a new hosted Exchange provider not long after.

All in all we managed to get most of the mail back. Only a few users ended up with missing emails, mostly due to using webmail so the message wasn't cached. It was a hell of a way to start a new job, though.

TL;DR: My third day as a support tech was spent recovering about 50 user's emails due to our Exchange vendor losing a server and not having a backup of it.",False,532,59,hyacinth17,talesfromtechsupport

**Brief background**
I work for a small IT company providing 1st and 2nd line support for a range of companies/small businesses in our area. It's a great place to learn and there are some really good people to work with, also the end users are generally really nice and accept we know what we are on about...mostly.


This story takes place earlier this year and does not have a happy ending.


**Cast**


Me : Young enthusiastic tech support guy

BO : Business owner who logged the call


&gt;Me : Hello this is Me from company how can I help you today

&gt;BO : Hello Me, this is BO from other company, we are having issues getting into users account, it looks like they have the wrong password

&gt;Me : Ok so just to be clear the user has forgotten their password and need assistance resetting it?
Not entirely uncommon as I'm sure most of you are aware

&gt; BO : No users password is wrong, it's not what it should be. You see we all have the same password in case someone is away or sick so we can just login to their account to get any work we need.

&gt; Me : .....

&gt; Me : .....

&gt; BO : Hello?

&gt; Me : Sorry, yes I am still here. I'm just not sure I fully grasp what you are telling me.

&gt; Me : You all have the same password and regularly login as other people to access data they don't save on the company drive?

&gt; BO : Yes, we all use *businessname1* but user has changed it and is off so we can't get into their account.


Now this is the point where my brain has completed its reboot cycle and is catching up. Not only do they all have the same password, it's literally in the top 10 of password not to use.


&gt; BO : So can you please set the users password back to *businessname1* so we can access their account as they have critical documents saved locally.


Now i've dealt with BO before and of he says it's urgent it is, I still had to try though.


&gt; Me : Ok BO, firstly I do not recommend we do that. Having every user with the same password is not only a bad idea it's down right catastrophic and will (already had as it turns out) lead to problems if anyone outside the organisation guesses that password. I can reset it to something you know so you can access the document the you need for now, the user can then reset it upon their return.

&gt; BO : No the standard password will be fine.


*Cue 20 minutes of back and forth for why this is a bad idea, including me getting my manager involved*


Now I'd like to say the logic and passion of my argument won over BO and a new era of security swept through other company, unfortunately this is real life.


&gt; BO : Ok I understand what you are saying, but ultimately it's our system and this is our policy. I'll send an email saying I forced you to do it but just do it as I have asked.


As mentioned my manager was involved, he said Customer has ultimate say and will have to pay if their system is hacked/encrypted if they insist on that password, so I did what I had to do to keep feeding my family.


&gt; Me : Very well I have set the password as requested (literally never felt so unclean), is there anything else I can help you with?

&gt; BO : No that's all thanks, and don't worry everything will be fine *click*


After the call I found out from a colleague this company was hacked last year, their response was to change their password to 'businessname1', it used to be 'businessname'. I still shudder when we get a new user request from them.


That's my tale of woe, let me know what you guys think, I have other more rewarding stories that have a happy ending if you want to hear them.

520,I've received my first free request from a stranger.,"It has begun. This is a minor case compared to many, but it's significant to me as my first unsolicited tech support request.

I'm halfway done with my computer science degree and while I help immediate family out with tech stuff from time to time, this one's a first. About an hour ago, I got a call from someone who I don't know at all. I didn't hear the phone ring, so she left a message:

&gt; Hi **Dielyr**, this is **JaneDoe**, I'm having a problem with my computer and talked with **FamilyMember** last night who said you could help me. I just need some help getting Microsoft Word compatible with my device, so that I can open resumes. Please call me back at your convenience.

Along with a text message from **FamilyMember** who almost never texts me: 

&gt; Good morning. Hope all is well. My friend **JaneDoe** is gonna call you this morning. She needs your advice on some computer questions and your dad said to ask you cause you can probably help her. I hope you don't mind. Thanks honey, enjoy the day.

They're seven hours away. I'm going to have to talk this woman through installing Word on what is apparently a vague nonstandard device over the phone with no visual, for free. Since my father refused to help I'm pretty sure it's macOS, which I have no experience with (so wish me luck with describing how to navigate the UI to where she needs to be, as I don't even know what the UI looks like...).

Clock's ticking; I'm gonna have to call back soon or else I'll look rude. 

Edit: Another family member, **FamilyMember2**, has now called me about it and I couldn't ignore this call - she doesn't want to install Word from Microsoft, she wants Word for free, oh no. His words:

&gt; Did you have a problem with my question? Do you mind doing it for me?

This is getting much too aggressive for me.

Update: I told **FamilyMember2** how to create a Google account and how to upload files to drive so that they can be edited/read. I assume he's passing that information on to her, as he 'had to go' immediately after and didn't instruct me to call her. Hopefully that resolves the issue. I still am pretty indignant about the fact that they volunteered my services to a stranger for free, and then framed it as me doing them a favor after calling me multiple times (**FamilyMember2** called me to ask me only 1.5 hours after the first call from **JaneDoe**). 

I understand I completely ignored the advice to just say no, advice that I wholly support and agree with. I am weak and susceptible to guilt trips and ""Oh come on, just do it for me. I'd do the same for you."" If she still has issues/needs something better, I think I'll just send her the installation page for LibreOffice/OpenOffice and be done with it. Now I need to figure out how best to tell my family what just happened is Not Okay. 

Update: The Google Drive instructions are ""not working"".

Final Update: Oh god I'm so glad I never called her back, it was a pdf file so I don't even know if Word would be able to even open it, and now **FamilyMember2** is lecturing me on how if my friends had car questions I'd ask him, so why can't the reverse be true.

521,When a quick job doesn't end up being quick...,"Long time reader but first time poster, I finally have a story good enough to share. This all happened yesterday.

Bit of a background, I work in IT for a company that supports various restaurants with their POS systems and other IT related stuff. All of these are owned by the same $Owner who loves to make last minute demands leaving us to figure out how to make it work. Most of the time it's repairing kitchen printers, but today's tale was something different.

**$Me**: Lowly IT guy

**$Manager**: Manager of the branch. Actually a cool guy who has decent basic IT skills and can troubleshoot the basic stuff himself. Very easy to work with.

It all starts with me relaxing in the office, having gotten most of the major jobs out of the way, so was hoping to take it easy. That is until I got the phone call from $Manager...

&gt;$Manager: Help! $Owner just called and wants to use the VIP room to watch today's match!

I looked at the date and realised our country was playing this evening for the football/soccer world cup.

&gt;$Me: I'm guessing you already tried hooking the laptop to the TV and using $FreeChannelSite to stream the game?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Manager: Yup, but the stream not stable and the Wi-Fi signal to the laptop is very weak.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: What time will $Owner arrive?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Manager: He'll be arriving an hour before the match starts.

Looking at the time it only gave me 5 hours. 4 hours if I exclude the travel time.

&gt;$Me: Alright, I'll pop over and I'll see if I can boost the signal.

I then remembered the VIP room was actually the opposite end away from the router, and that the access point serving the main area is in the floor below, so it makes sense that the room will have almost no signal. Due to the lack of time though, running a cable from the main switch to the room won't be possible, as it will need to go through another private room which is also booked for the evening, and there won't be enough time to tidy the cable away. I searched the office and find a powerline Wi-Fi kit and a Wi-Fi repeater, decommissioned from other sites. Did a quick test with them and they still worked, so factory reset them, configured them with the correct Wi-Fi settings and off I went.

Arrived at the site, loaded up the Wi-Fi analyser app on my phone, and confirmed the room was getting a very weak signal, so $Manager was right. I installed the powerlines first, hoping not to resort to the repeater as I knew from experience how unreliable they can be, and $Owner would explode if the stream randomly stopped. One of the powerline modules acts as an access point as well which I know $Owner will want to use. And... it worked. Straight away with no issues. Connected my phone and did a quick speed test, and it was more than fast enough for the stream. Latency was also good too.

Thinking I could wrap this up quickly I then proceed to connect the laptop up... only to find while it was connecting, it was not getting a valid IP at all. Restarted the adapter and it still wasn't getting the right network settings. So I restarted the laptop only to find it took a while to boot up. During that, $Manager walks in.

&gt;$Manager: Hey, how's it going? Is it working yet?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: I've managed to boost the signal to the room, and it's a good speed, but the laptop doesn't want to properly connect to it so I'm just restarting it.

$Manager connects his phone to the powerline AP, does a speed test too and he's happy with it.

&gt;$Manager: Wi-Fi is good at least. Forgot to mention but when we connect the laptop to the sound system, there's no sound coming out at all.

Oh. Guess this job will take a little longer.

&gt;$Me: Alright I'll have a look once the laptop's ready.

$Manager then goes off back to his job. By then the laptop has finally finished booting up and is happily receiving a valid IP and is able to connect to the internet with no issues. Loaded up the stream and it's running very smoothly.

Checked time and had 3 hours left. No need to worry right? The laptop connected to the TV is happily streaming so let's see why there's no sound. I hook up the sound system to the laptop's audio jack and yup, no sound. Looked at the laptop's sound settings and... yeah, the default sound device was the TV. Switched it over to the correct one and and boom, sound is now going through the sound system. Except... only half the speakers in the room had sound. The other half didn't.

I checked the amplifier and all seemed fine over there, however it was reporting it was only receiving the right sound channel with the left channel receiving nothing. I managed to nail the problem down to the 3.5mm to RCA cable, wiggling the 3.5mm side brings the left channel back but only for a fraction of a second. I went to find $Manager to see if he had any spares, and luckily from the store room there was one. Plugged it in and all was good. Sound is now happily filling the room evenly.

Except... the stream is for some reason now stuttering. I checked the internet speed again and it was still strong. I then noticed the laptop was a lot warmer than usual. Loaded up task manager and the CPU was on 100&amp;#37;. *Why*. Loaded up the processes, sorted it by CPU usage and there it was. To confirm what I'm seeing I load up the settings and y*up. Windows Update has kicke*d in. This laptop has not been turned on for over a year, and it's eagerly downloading/preparing the Windows 10 Fall Creators update. 2 hours left until $Owner arrives. Seeing there's not much I can do about this, I close the stream so all the laptop's resources can focus on the updates. I also decided to might as well remove the extra stuff installed on the laptop that could also be slowing it down.

An hour later with the laptop now having less programs running in the background and a lot less running at startup, it was now prompting to restart so it could begin the Fall Creators update. Seeing as how long that will take... not going to happen. I changed the restart option to happen well after the match has finished and changed the active hours to be after closing time. After all, there's also the Spring Creators update it will want to do as well. No time for that. I loaded up the stream, and everything was running smoothly, with just under an hour before $Owner arrives.

I let $Manager know it's all up and running, he has a look and is happy with it. I mention the laptop also wants to update as well and $Manager said he can handle it afterwards. I then make my way home as it's also the end of my shift, expecting a call about $Owner complaining about the laptop randomly restarting. Luckily the laptop didn't restart. Unluckily $Owner was still angry. Mostly because our country lost the match.",False,424,56,Yahiroz,talesfromtechsupport

523,The Pulsing External Monitor,"Not IT, but I know about 5% of what a seasoned tech does which seemingly puts my knowledge above 85% of the population.

A couple months ago, my company started rolling out new computers for everybody. I was fortunate enough to snag a brand new laptop and docking station (on ancient desktop previously). This required a bit of desk reorganization so I could dual-screen with my external monitor. The problem occurred the first time I had to unlock the system after it went idle. The external monitor would receive the signal to wake and display my desktop for about 3 seconds, then go black for 3, and continue this cycle until I pulled the cable for the dock for about 15 seconds before plugging it in again. Laptop display would be behaving normally during this time.

Once I was back to working the problem would not return until the system would automatically lock for inactivity. It would only be a mild annoyance if the timeout wasn't so short. In the time it took to go to the restroom or get some coffee I would return to a locked system and the pulsing monitor. Add to that multiple meetings per day I could have this issue up to 10 times in a shift. 

Not wanting to bug IT with something that I may be able to fix on my own, I began Googling. There were a few support articles regarding updating display drivers and BIOS--things I am prevented from doing without admin rights. Damn. Time to get IT involved. So, I call my boy, Red, and he explains that all drivers and BIOS are up to date and at versions equal to the articles that were to fix the issue. He says we'd probably just have to replace the laptop as nobody else was having this issue. I asked him to hold off on that while I try to dig more to prevent replacing a $1,500 laptop unnecessarily. Defeated, I sat down for lunch and pulled up /r/talesfromtechsupport to pass the time.

Reading along, I get to a post (which you'll recognize in a moment) where a problem that had been stumping the tech for weeks actually had a very simple solution. I shook my head thinking there is no way my bluetooth speaker could be the culprit. I mean, the laptop itself has a magnet on that side to hold the stylus! And the speaker is far enough away that it can't be the cause, right? But for the sake of science, I moved the little box 10 inches further away from the laptop.

Well, here I am, over a week later, and I have not had the problem again. Earlier this week I saw Red walking through the office and I knew I had to tell him.

One of my mom's friends got a brand new pc for his 13 year old son. He wants somebody to set it up for the first time. It's 5pm. I haven't arrived from high school yet.

My mom's friend get anxious and hire a computer science graduate to do it.

It's 8pm now, I arrive home and mom tell me about the matter. I go to the guy's house to set the pc up. 

unbeknownst to me that graduate has been working with it for a little bit more of 2 hours.

When I show up, they explain the computer came broken and won't turn on. Gonna be back for warranty at the shop tomorrow.

""May I check it?""

""Well, you won't solve anything.""

""Just in case, may I?""

""Whatever anon, don't take more than 5 minutes""

(Check the power button, hear no PSU fan. Check PSU, voltage switch is set at 220, we have 110 in the country, switch the thing, it turns on)

Never have seen a guy so ashamed as this graduate. Probably he was a good man, no reason to get so ashamed of a little mistake. His face was funny as hell anyway.

529,Why do something yourself when IT can do it?,"This story takes place between three people. 

$E1: Employee 1, a 70+ year old woman who probably sucked at her job even before we asked her to use computers. If it was possible to break a computer by looking at it, she could do it.

$E2: Employee 2, 28 year old customer service rep, filling in the order processing role as our normal employee who processes orders is out on maternity leave.

$me: yours truly.

Before we get going, let’s talk about this maternity leave thing. We’ll call this person $Mom. 9 months ago, when $Mom found out she was pregnant, she told management that she thought $E1 would be the best person to train to fill in while shes out, because $E2 is cross trained in Shipping and Engineering (our engineering department is not filled with engineers. They just put together samples that a customer requests before placing an order)

$mom is right, with $E2 being the most flexible CS Rep, we shouldn’t also rely on her to do processing because if Shipping or Engineering is short handed, she has to go there to fill in. So we train $E1. 6 months of training later, and management is basically giving $mom the “what the fuck is going on” look because E1 still doesn’t have the hang of it. We make an executive decision. $E1 can’t handle the job, we’ll change tactics, have have $E2 fill in. She trained for 2 weeks, had it down, and no issues. 

$Mom had her baby last week.

$E1 is micromanaging the shit out of $E2. And she’s generally just a pain in the ass overall.

Then I get this email.

$E1: “Hey $Me, can you go in the $EXCELFILENAME.XLSX and delete the word “BUYOUT” from the notes column on item XYZ for $E2? She’s processing a new order but we’re going to make it here instead of buying it this time.”

$Me: “Thanks $E1. $E2, is this actually something you need help with?”

$E2: “No. i just click the cell and press delete right?”

$Me: “Yep. Thanks everyone.”

531,"""I want a new laptop"" *5 seconds later* ""Is this a cheap laptop?""","So, one of my coworkers $Coworker1 had what was the worst laptop (it's about four years old) at our company. I had told my boss $Boss that I was most concerned about $Coworker1's laptop repeatedly.

Naturally, another coworker $Coworker2 has an issue where his screen is messed up. These guys are out in the field a lot, so I don't necessarily have access to their laptops regularly. So $Boss orders another laptop for $Coworker2, because he can't have $Coworker2 without one.

When I finally get $Coworker2's laptop back, I am unable to duplicate the issue he was experiencing. I do open it up and make sure all the connections are connected. At this point $Coworker2 has a new laptop that he's quite happy with -- for once, $Boss listened to me about the amount of RAM he should get for it.

So I tell $Boss that I am still concerned about $Coworker1's laptop, and it would be cheaper to purchase additional RAM for $Coworker2's old laptop and give that to $Coworker1. He agrees to that. When I inquire about the shipping to choose, $Boss tells me to just give $Coworker2's old laptop to $Coworker1.

That's not great because we use some syncing software for a much larger amount of data than is recommended, and that software scans its entire directory for changes. I have been over this with $Boss. I've fought to get about half of what is needed for all of the laptops and that's solved a good portion of the issues.

Another thing that solved one of the issues was when I figured out $Coworker1 had a folder recursion and wasn't able to sync because of it. (There are multiple syncing directories at this point, which I am hesitant to delete in case something we may need is in the wrong one, and of course the syncing software isn't designed to resolve this.)

Anyway, I know that $Coworker2's old laptop is still better than the one $Coworker1 is using. So I diligently start setting it up, anticipating reactions I am likely to get like ""Why is this folder called $Coworker2?"" and resolving them, as well as spending the requisite 72 hours syncing too many files with not enough RAM and doing it on a weekend when it won't be as much of a nuisance.

I get it ready, $Coworker1 is having issues with his laptop, I let him know I have $Coworker2's old laptop. $Coworker1 is at the office the next day and I let him know I am ready for the switch at which point $Coworker1's laptop is suspiciously working fine. I sigh, and resign myself to the fact that I will be ready when it's. . . not.

We also get a new hire during the period where I'm setting that up, so $Boss orders $Newhire (new hire, new laptop) a new laptop. (It wasn't in the office one morning, so I panicked a little because it was there when I left, but it turned out $Newhire, who wasn't out in the field at that point, picked it up after.) She actually has a pretty decent laptop that she ends up bringing in and pretty much uses that. The new laptop ends up just sitting around for a while.

Eventually, $Boss asks me about getting a much more powerful laptop for something $Newhire will be doing. I make a recommendation with a little help from Reddit. $Boss orders it, I set it up and it's for the most part not used on my desk.

Eventually, $Newhire wants to use it for the thing she's doing. She tries doing from the file off her flash drive, so I move that file off the drive and run it off the powerful laptop's SSD. Instead of days, it takes less than an hour. Not too long after that, $Newhire starts using that laptop more, moves it to her desk.

The office manager who cleans helps $Newhire with her desk set up, and encourages her to switch to using the powerful laptop, which makes sense. Then $Officemanager suggests that I give the first laptop we bought for $Newhire to $Coworker1.

So I talk to $Coworker1 and let him know that we're going to do that and that it's faster than $Coworker1's current laptop. So I set it up for him instead of for $Newhire, spend another 72 hours syncing to his account.

While I'm doing that, I compare the CPUs of all the laptops we have and saved the results. I notice that $Coworker3 has the second worst laptop, and again. . . $Coworker2's old laptop is significantly better than the one he's using.

I mention to $Coworker3 that I would like to switch out the one he's using because $Coworker's old one is better. He responds that his is working, so why would we do that?

I ask $Newhire why I keep getting this reaction, and she's not really sure, maybe they're just used to their laptops. She does remind me how $Coworker1 is resistant, having asked me about the new laptop and if it will fit in his bag. I apparently put it next to his current one to demonstrate they are the same size.

So, today $Coworker1 comes in and it's on his desk and ready (minus some maintenance I had not had time to do). Then he mentions having some stuff on the old laptop that he would like to transfer, which is fine by me. But I do tell him that I would like him to start using the new one. As I am doing some setup stuff for him, **he asks me if it's a cheap laptop.**

I pull up my comparison of the CPUs of our laptops and read off the benchmarks, something like 1900 on the old one, compared to 4016 on the new one. $Coworker1 then states that's four hundred times as fast, and I repeat the numbers and state the benchmark's a little over twice as much.

$Newhire gets in a little later today (she's been out in the field). Then:

&gt;$Coworker1: Wow, this laptop is really zoomin'.

&gt;$Newhire: See? That's why when OP tries to replace your laptop you shouldn't resist.

&gt;$Coworker1: I wasn't resisting.

&gt;$Newhire: You were asking if it would fit in your bag, is this a good computer. . .

&gt;$Coworker1: I didn't do any of that.

&gt;$Officemanager: *laughing* 20 minutes ago you asked if it was a cheap laptop!

$Newhire and I were both laughing really hard after that.

Set it to defragment as I was leaving.

TL;DR: Trust your IT guy when he says a laptop is better than your current one.

534,You want earn money on poor people suffering with cancer!!," Hello everyone,

Been suggested to post this here as you guys would enjoy this story

Just one thing on beginning: My English is poor, so please excuse my grammar, formatting, etc...

This happened 3 years ago when I joined small IT company. I started as the IT Technician dedicated to offer support on site with servers, computers, emails, etc. However, in not that busy time I’ve been asked to do some “laptop” repairs in our workshop. At that time, I did not have much knowledge about hardware in cheap laptops like the one that this story would be about.

Everything started at one day when I did not have nothing to do, so I’ve been asked to assist Workshop manager by helping with some of the jobs or with booking of the jobs to the workshop. Older couple walked in to our workshop with cheap laptop. Let’s call the brand of that laptop **H**arry**P**otter. They complained about slow speed and some of the keys on laptop have not been working. So, I took their details and explained, that we are limited with the things that we can do with keyboard to fix it and we might would need to replace the keyboard.

Workshop manager told me that this job should be simple for me and to have a look at it straight away, so I did. I booted up the Laptop and realized that there was barely 1 letter that was working. Usually replacing keyboard is much cheaper then trying to fix faulty one. I took out the keyboard, connected external one then proceeded to look on performance issues. Taking away unneeded start-up entries and services rapidly increased performance of the laptop. After this initial work I called the customer that the performance issue was resolved, and the keyboard would require to be replaced. I quoted them our minimal bench fee (around 30£) and price of the new keyboard (around 12£). Keyboard arrived, and I did connect the new keyboard. After that laptop refused to boot up. Fast forward this was caused by keyboard, but because my poor knowledge in laptops hardware I told customer that the motherboard failed (Yeah, funny I know). They said that this is strange and mentioned that they will get their son to call us as he is working for brand HarryPotter.

Next day I received call from “John” and said that he is from head office of HarryPotter (And indeed he was, as I found later through some searching on internet). He proceeded with questions like: Have you been using Genuine keyboard, have you been doing work on anti-statics matts, etc… After these questions has been answered mostly with word Yes, he then proceeded that he thinks that I want to scam his parents and earn easy money. He also said that this is extremely unacceptable as his father suffering with cancer and I can’t imagine what he had to go through. I did say I did not quoted them more then our minimum bench fee and, I did not offer them any replacement of their laptop, so with all respect I don’t know why he does have that feeling. Also, I said I know how people with cancer suffer as my Grand Mother died because of cancer.

After my Workshop Manger found where I did the mistake I called him and apologised for my mistake and said that we will fix that. He replied that he is not interested, and his parents will collect the laptop and he will fix it for them.

They collected laptop and I though this would be end of that. After two months they came back to our workshop with laptop which was completely stripped down and broken motherboard in half. They said his son couldn’t fix the laptop and he damaged motherboard. We told them that the motherboard can’t be fixed, and replacement would be beyond economical repair and we offered them new laptop. They agreed, and we transferred all their DATA to new machine.

My Workshop manager decided to call customer's son after they visit us for second time, just for the fun. Workshop manager was asking something like we need to find what happened with this laptop as your parents could not explained it to us. He was trying to blame us for breaking M/B in half and lot of different BS. He newer really admitted that he broke the motherboard.

In the end they been so impressed how we prepared new machine for them and with the performance of new machine, that they decide to sign maintenance contract with our workshop and mentioned that they would never ask their son to fix their laptop.",False,1188,80,Spitfire_SVK,talesfromtechsupport
535,"Dr Tearjerker, or How I Learned to Hate Chemical Spills","*Hi there. It's your friendly neighbourhood medicinal chemist here, back with another story filled with carcinogens and (literal) tears. I'm also happy to report that I'm no longer a lowly PhD student - I've ascended to the heady realms of postdoctoral researcher. You can call me Dr Fitzarr.*

**$Me:** Your newly-minted postdoctoral researcher.

**$PhD:** A PhD student from a neighbouring research group to mine.

**$Res:** A researcher from Biology

**$Est:** Our estates leader

**$MSc:** A MSc student from the aforementioned group.

**$Boss:** My boss, also Head of Section.

**$BigBoss:** My boss's boss, our Head of School. Also the head of the neighbouring research group.

Hi everyone! It's nice to be back. I've submitted a couple of other stories from my experience as the tehcnically-kind-of-not-really tech support person for my organic chemistry department at a research organisation in the UK. For background, see them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7qszyo/a_tale_of_supermagnets_and_servers/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/85imrw/should_it_be_spraying_methanol_everywhere/).

I have a doozy of a story today. Technically, these events took place a couple of weeks ago - however, there has been a lot of drama and fallout that only really resolved itself in the last couple of days (and I didn't want this to be one of those multi-part epics). So, strap in, and come along with me for the ride. Unlike previous cases with my posts here, there isn't a lot of technical information to provide to help the non-chemist understand the background. Really, I just need to tell you what [lachrymators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear\_gas) are. Essentially, a lachrymator is any chemical that causes people to produce tears.

As I stated in my intro, I'm no longer a PhD student! I've recently been promoted to postdoctoral researcher. As part of this (as well as being paid an actual wage), I'm now officially in charge of lab safety for our small section of the department. This includes both my research group and the neighbouring group. This group is technically supervised by $BigBoss. However, his role as Head of School leaves precious little time for actual supervision. I'm therefore the default go-to person for a lot of  the day-to-day issues, as well as being the person who can now officially tell other people they're being idiots. I was therefore the person called by $PhD when the entire neighbouring research group started crying uncontrollably.

After ruling out an impromptu viewing of Forrest Gump or Marley and Me, I evacuated the area and informed our estates team that something was potentially up. I then donned a face mask (which barely helped) and looked for the source of whatever was causing the problem. A pool of liquid on the floor by the chemical inventory seemed the obvious culprit, especially as it was giving off an acrid smell only suitable for Beelzebub's arsehole. I backed a healthy retreat, and waited for $Est to arrive with the proper health and safety equipment. Armed with much better masks, we cleaned up the spill, and I took a small sample to run through our LCMS to see what it was. Thinking the worst was over, I signed on $Est's accident report and went back to my lab to write an angry email about cleaning up spills. Even before the LCMS had finished running, $PhD was back in my office saying the problem wasn't resolved. They were still crying buckets of tears and unable to work safely.

I called $Est again, and investigated the lab and office of $BigBoss's group more thoroughly. This time, I turned up something much more interesting. At the bottom of the bins in the office and the lab there were wads of tissue soaked with the same thing (by smell, at least) as had been on the floor of the lab. At this point, it should be noted that we have large bins with fluorescent orange bags in them for hazardous chemical waste (this covers everything from gloves and tissues to chemical reagents etc). These bins were not the ones used for the soaked tissues. The use of the office bin was particularly crazy even from a logistical stand-point, as you would have to walk past two chemical bins to even get to the office door. We have strict rules about what is allowed in the lab and what is allowed in the office. Tissues soaked in mystery chemicals is definitely not on the latter list. I therefore was left with only two options: 1) incredible incompetence, 2) deliberate foul play.

At this point, I made an executive decision that no-one would be going into these offices for a while. Definitely until we found out whatever the hell the chemical was and had done a thorough deep-clean of the office space. $Est and his team started on a full search and clean mode, and I went to $Boss's office. I informed him of what I'd found, what I'd done, and that he would probably want to see $BigBoss as soon as possible. After discussing the details with him (and watching him get more and more incredulous), I went to check the results of the LCMS. They were decidedly inconclusive; whatever the compound was didn't ionise well, or was otherwise difficult to analyse this way. Method number two. Take the sample I'd scraped off the floor, run it through some filtration setup, then attempt to get an NMR spectrum. After a lot of faffing around, I managed to get a half-decent spectrum. This revealed the identity of our lachrymator: [benzyl bromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzyl_bromide). I'll let the Safety section of the wikipedia article speak for itself.

&gt;Benzyl bromide is a strong lachrymator and is also intensely irritating to skin and mucous membranes. Because of these properties, it has been used in chemical warfare, both in combat and in training due to its irritating yet non-lethal nature.

By the time I'd confirmed the identity of the compound, the investigation of what the hell had happened was in full swing. $Est had sealed off the office and lab space with hazard tape, and $Boss and $BigBoss were busy interrogating the members of $BigBoss's research team. The whole thing was a bit surreal. General suspicion in the department fell (fairly or not) upon $MSc - the most junior member of the team. $MSc was also rather typical of the course intake over the past few years; a foreign student without a strong chemistry background who had to be taught a lot of basic principles about lab safety. In any case, no-one was talking or accepting blame.

Over the following week, $Est and our security team reviewed CCTV (we don't have it in the labs/offices, but on the entrances to the department) and office fob records. These didn't appear to reveal anything suspicious. A number of emails were sent to members of the department informing them of the incident and asking them to come forward with any information, and keep an eye out for suspicious behaviour. There was inevitably a lot of gossip flying around as well.

Cut to the events of Monday. Another member of the department was working particularly late (around 9pm), and happened to spot someone going into the office space of $BigBoss's group. They called security, and $Res (a researcher I didn't previously know from Biology) was caught going through the chemical inventory of $BigBoss without a good explanation as to why. $BigBoss was called in from home, and $Res apparently confessed to planting the previous spill to get back at $BigBoss for not endorsing a research grant that would have enabled him to stay at the university.

All in all, easily the most dramatic event of my time here. Even beating out the discovery of some WWII hand-grenades in the basement.",False,386,64,Fitzarr,talesfromtechsupport

$Selben: Me! A Tier I ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company with a very skeleton-crew helpdesk. 10 of us total providing 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) for 2500+ users company-wide.

$Sup1: Previously in sales with no IT background and causes more issues than they solve.
 
$Peers: Tier 1 technicians.
 
$Sup2: All around great supervisor, worked his way up from the support line, understands how the helpdesk works.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
The grind had not yet gotten to $Selben. Arriving at work for the day, he cheerfully greeted the front desk employee as he continued to the IT area. Picking up a cup of coffee, he headed over to his cubicle. $Sup2 gave a little wave hello while busy working on a project. $Selben checked his voicemail as he powered up his machine. He started working on the T1 ticket queue. It wasn’t glamorous work, listening and transcribing voicemails, and requesting more info from users, but it was necessary.
After a couple hours, the first supervisor change of the day happened. $Sup2 headed out and $Sup1 took over. $Selben wasn’t a huge fan of $Sup1 as he was usually too busy bragging about his last “hot date” to be of any real help or use. Whenever a major issue arose he would often make himself scarce and unavailable, until it became the next supervisor’s problem.

Things were going well until $Selben came across an email and matching voice mail. Both were vague and sounded like a user had lost a vehicle. Why would IT be involved in this? $Selben opted to contact the branch’s manager, $Gruntled, for more details.

The phone call was broken up and full of static, which made understanding $Gruntled, the disgruntled user, even more difficult.


&gt; $Gruntled: Gruntled!

&gt; $Selben: Hello. This is $Selben from the IT department. I’m calling about a voicemail and email you left. I need some more infor—.

&gt; $Gruntled: Did you find it yet? Plate number 12345!

&gt; $Selben: Uh, no, not yet. I wanted to clarify what you needed? Your message was a little vague.

&gt; $Gruntled: My truck is missing! YOU PEOPLE NEED TO FIND IT!

&gt; $Selben: Right. This is the IT department. I’m still not sure…?

&gt; $Gruntled: OH NO, YOU DON’T! This is YOUR issue, not mine! We only have 2 weeks left, you better find it! Bye!

 
$Selben sat trying to get the gears in his head to move again. He had been blindsided by the call and wasn’t sure how to proceed. It was times like this he missed $Soda. He took what notes he had and approached $Sup1’s office for guidance. Who had his feet on the desk and was playing with his phone. He looked annoyed when he noticed $Selben in his doorway. 

$Selben explained the issue, with the little information he had: The manager kept proclaiming that his truck was missing, and that it was IT’s responsibility to find it.
 
&gt; $Sup1: And?
&gt; $Selben: Could it be some GPS thing maybe that only we have access to on some vehicles?
 
$Sup1 did not even look up from his phone.
 
&gt; $Sup1: No. If it’s lost, report it to the police, and close the ticket.
&gt; $Selben: I mean, could it be something…
 
$Sup1 looked up for a moment, very annoyed.
 
&gt; $Sup1: Just go do it!

At first $Selben was reprimanded for calling the police until he showed his notes indicating that $Sup1 had given him the directive to do so. $Sup1 denied the claims and eventually the whole thing was dropped, since if $Sup1 wasn’t at fault, then no one was at fault.

539,Hexagisimal != Decimal,"After years of lurking I finally have something to post!

$me - me, not officially tech support but i occasionally use VBA and can check to see if things are plugged in so you know how it goes...

$TL - team leader for team on other side of my office. Nice enough but exclusively asks for my help when I'm on my lunch break.

Our individual timesheets are fairly simple spreadsheets that calculate hours worked by time in, lunch break, and time out, all updated by the employee, very straight forward. There is also a place to note sick days/annual leave as these are paid so wouldn't count against your hours worked. A work day is 7hr 24m FYI.

One employee took a half day sick and so credited herself 3:42 in the area alotted. No problems.

$TL has apparently checked the ID card logs and finds that it wasn't a full half day and wants to put the actual time in/out for posterity. It won't change the amount the employee is paid or affect her sickness record at all but whatever tickles your giblets I suppose, it doesn't involve me...or does it?

'Course it does.

$TL comes over in my lunch break, I pointedly ignore, $TL isn't fazed, she asks for help. I'm on my lunch break. She asks again. Still on lunch break. She concedes and agrees to email the problem to me. She leaves. I keep eating, and each bite is all the sweeter.

Off my lunch break now and positively wetting myself with anticipation.

$TL (email): can you have a look at [REDACTED] timesheet. She has entered 3.42 and I need to change it to 4.89 but every time I try it comes up with a random formula.

$Me to $Me: surely she isn't trying to...?

She was.

Now obviously for reasons of sanity and sense our timesheets are formatted as [h]:[mm]. In this format 3:42 is half of 7:24 i.e.a full day's work.

I sigh. I stand. I walk the length of the office. $TLs there. She isn't on her lunch break therefore I approach. Be the change you want to see in the world.

$Me: $TL?

$TL: oh hi! Have you fixed it? Was it a problem with the formulas?

$Me: yeah, it got little bit confused because there can't be 89 minutes in an hour...where did you get that number from?

$TL: Well [REDACTED] only worked 2hrs 35 minutes so I...

*Pulls out calculator* 7.24 - 2.35 = ...

$TL: see? 4.89!

$Me internally : But... But... Maths

$Me externally: yeah the calculator assumes you're using decimalised numbers, but because minutes stop at 60 the results are going to be a little different.

I knew she was lost at ""decimalised numbers"" but fair play i felt like she'd found the trail again at ""stop at 60""

$TL: oooh... (Understanding creeps across her face)... So I just...

541,There are dinosaurs coming from the fiber optic cables outside.,"Obligatory ""this didn't happen to me"", but still one of my favorite tech support stories I've ever heard.

Unimportant backstory: I was having some issues with my cable box not displaying a certain channel (if you must know, I just really needed to watch Law &amp; Order re-runs and that was the only channel not working). This turned into 2+ hours of system resets, updating firmware, a bunch of things I don't understand but the tech finally got it working.

As we had a solid 2.5+ hours on the phone, with a majority being waiting time, we wound up chatting and I asked him about his most ridiculous IT story. Hilarity ensued.

$TS: tech support$OL: old lady

In the area $OL lived in, they had just dug up and placed underground fiber optic cables. $OL calls in to tech support with an...unusual issue.

$OL: ""Due to the new cables underground, dinosaurs have been coming out at night. I need this fixed immediately.""

($TS could barely breathe while telling me this story, and assures me this is 100&amp;#37; what she said, in a very matter-of-fact tone).

$TS in his infinite wisdom, decides that there is no way possible this lady will be happy with being told, ""That is impossible."" Instead, he tells her, ""I am so sorry, that is an issue we have been having with the new cables. Right now I will reset the system, and this will no longer happen.""

$OL was satisfied with this and hung up.

543,Free service for family will always come back to bite you.,"Inspired by [Streaming Services Require Internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8md57c/streaming_services_require_internet/), I bring you my tale of woe.

A few years back, my mother was ""employed"" by a local businessman who ran his various companies out of his own home.  She evidently did some bookkeeping of some sort for him, and used her personal computer to do so.  Evidently, the guy was reluctant to let my mother connect to his personal network, so he configured her laptop to connect to the $localISP public access points, and used his own UserID/Password to authenticate past the captive portal.  The ISP in question happens to broadcast their ""Public"" access point from almost every residential Router/AP combo that they install, so my mother had internet access seemingly everywhere she went.

Fast forward about 3 years, and Mom moves into my apartment building.  Naturally, with me being in an apartment 2 floors below her, I automatically become tech support.  Again.  I moved out over a decade ago to escape this!  Regardless, I was able to deflect most of her requests by gently explaining that I'm a Linux Sysadmin, and therefore have absolutely no idea why she cannot do XYZ with her Windows computer.  (Sssh.  That's my excuse.)  This worked up to a point, but eventually her laptop powered off for the last time.  Being that I'm the one who selected and purchased the machine a few years prior, ownership of the problem naturally falls to me.

After the machine showed up at my front door, I proceeded to break out the tools and tear it down.  The motherboard's shot.  The main CPU fan hasn't been spinning for who knows how long, the innards are clogged with bed fuzz.  The dodgy power adapter that's serving as her third replacement tests good on my bench after cleaning it up and patching some insulation, but it likely had a hand in the machine's demise.  It's not worth my time to chase parts and attempt to service this machine, so I order a cheap Dell business class notebook off Ebay.  The system shipped without an OS, and I don't own a Windows license.  I throw Ubuntu Linux on-board, give Mom a primer on how to connect it to her network and use it, and shoo her out of my apartment so I can get back to work that actually pays me money.

The follow-up call comes in promptly.  She can't connect to Youtube.  I try to remote in, but TeamViewer doesn't show her machine online.  I ask whether she's connected it to her wireless.  I get a quizzical silence in response, so I grab another laptop for testing and hike upstairs to check things out.  I ask where her router is - there's not one.  I ask who she pays for service - she doesn't.  It hits me - she's been using $localISP's free-for-customers hotspot feature for years, piggybacking off her former employer's account credentials.  The idea of paying for internet simply never crossed her mind, she's had it everywhere.  I connect the machine, point her to the captive portal, and ask her to log in.  I get a blank stare in return.  She has no idea what the credentials could be.  Her former employer had shut up shop ages ago and even though they were still friendly, he no longer had a login for her to use.  But how had she retained connectivity up until this point on the prior laptop?

I'd always suspected that $localISP wasn't authenticating the captive portal login every time, and was instead likely using the MAC address to whitelist clients.  I rushed downstairs and grabbed the WLAN card from Mom's old laptop, which was in bits on my dining room floor.  I installed a macchanger app, configured the new laptop's card to use her old card's mac, and SUCCESS!  Well...until a reboot.  The MAC address reset every time the machine restarted, or even if the system was powered on for long enough.  Frustrated with troubleshooting my hack, I decided to swap the old card into her ""new"" machine - after living for years with IBM/Lenovo hardware whitelists on my ThinkPads, I thought the chances of success were slim.  But, upon reboot, the machine's (downgraded) network card connected immediately to the $localISP hotspot.

Looking on the bright side here,  I got the significantly better AC card in trade for the  N card I swapped in from the old laptop.  Mom gets to stream Youtube to her heart's content, and continue her apparently eternal free ride on $localISP's network.  I just pray that that machine never breaks.",False,1097,123,TheTechStewart,talesfromtechsupport

545,"Yup, that sounds familiar.","So from 2011-2014, I worked at a website hosting company, and then I quit to be a stay at home mom.

$Host had a bit of a problem with email servers getting blacklisted with 3rd party services such as Spamhaus because spam emails could be traced back to our servers. The way things were set up, we had a large number of servers handling email, and literally thousands and thousands of customer servers would funnel their emails in and out of these servers. With a customer base in the millions, and customer email accounts in the god-knows-how-many millions, you can imagine what a pain it is when one of these mail servers gets blacklisted. Suddenly we’d be getting calls over and over about bounceback emails.

Sometimes we would also see email spoofing, rather than an actual hacked account. That one was a little more time consuming to confirm, since it required getting the customer to find the email headers and send them to us.

The quick solution is to shut down that customer’s ability to send out emails until they fix the hacked account or fix the easily exploited contact-us form on their website. 

**Anyway. Fast forward.** I’ve been out of the tech support game for 4 years now, enjoying my time as a stay at home mom. 

Sister makes a post on Facebook:

&gt; It looks like my Gmail account was hacked. How does this happen? I don’t go to any questionable websites. I don’t understand it. Does changing my password really help at this point? Has the damage already been done? Can anyone give me answers to any of the questions above?”

My first thought is that her gmail probably wasn’t actually hacked, but that she’s likely a victim of spoofing. “I’ve seen it a thousand times before at %Host.” So I reply:

&gt; Can you post a screenshot of the email headers from one of the emails that someone received from you? It may actually be “spoofing” where the actual sender isn’t you, and they’re editing the email headers to appear as if it came from you.

TL;DR it’s all black magic fuckery to her, no matter how many examples I show her. But she gets the headers back from her friend, so I can finally just get it figured out instead of trying to explain it.

Inside the headers I find evidence of spoofing:

&gt; Return-Path: &lt;sister.name@randomdomain.com&gt;

&gt; X-Source-Auth: &lt;user@randomdomain.com&gt;

&gt; X-Antiabuse: Sender Address Domain - randomdomain.com

I screenshot this and go to scribble a red line around these things, and send it back to her saying “yep, it’s spoofed.”

...And while I’m outlining these lines that I was talking about, I see:

&gt; X-Antiabuse: Primary Hostname - server#.$host.com

[My face when...](https://media1.tenor.com/images/51c1d9515f36ed8ae5f0e27d6966433f/tenor.gif)

Me:

&gt; You’ll want to also forward these headers over to tos@$host.com so they can suspend randomdomain.com’s ability to send emails. This green highlighted line says it’s happening from a domain on $Host’s servers.

Email was sent, mystery is solved, and hopefully, bounceback emails for another few thousand people may be averted in time. (For all I know, that customer’s mail is already suspended, but shhh - let me be the hero,)

546,Dadisms and providing dad IT support over the years,"For once not posting about work but general Dad'ism and IT support for the old man over the years. My dad bless is kind of stuck in the 60s and 70s and his patience is random each day. I have been giving my parents IT support and help since the end of the 90s when they got into the whole internet thing as my dad calls it. My mum can use a smart phone or laptop and doesn't require much help. I basically build her a laptop put Office on with Chrome and away she goes!

**Technical terms my dad has used over the years:**

Hard Drive

\- Describing the PC case/tower he kept this up until about 2 years ago

""Whats my email website""

\- Not long after first using email he was still calling it this until about 2007

I'm running out of RAM space on this USB stick

\- Teaching him about USB sticks took many sessions/phone calls

I don't like this new mouse I prefer one with a ball

\- Optical mouse upgrade

We put a new cartridge in the printer about 6 months ago it's run out already?

\- Always complaining about the printer

If I put in Robin AND Pete's email address can I email them both at the same time?

\- Not long after first using email

Many years ago he was part of a fishing club and I did some part time work setting them up a website. After it had been reviewed by the fishing club and went live my dad began to complain that he wasn't getting emails.

**Me:** ""What email address did you give them, also it's on the website under Contact Us people can use that or just click and it'll open an email box""

**Dad:** ""The one you told me [www.fishingclub.co.uk](https://www.fishingclub.co.uk)""

**Me:** ""No that's the website address remember email is the one with the @ symbol so it will be [dad@fishingclub.co.uk](mailto:dad@fishingclub.co.uk)""

**Dad:** ""Let me write this down it's so much to remember I thought you could email either""

Over the years my dad has lost his temper and broken a lot of IT tech. A Lexmark printer ended up going out the bedroom window hitting the patio below. I built my parents a nice shiny dual core PC to upgrade their old dying AMD system when they moved house. My dad decided upon getting angry with Word and Excel really pressing the power button hard or thumping it would work. I visited one day and notice 2 screws in the front of the PC case.  My dad had used a bit of force on the power button and it had depressed into the case, so he had used a metal bracket and two screws to hold it back in place. Slightly impressed he had opened the case up without breaking the PC itself.

I remember a story when I was about 13 when I was first getting in to IT and building computers. I had bought my first PC from a company called Tiny. It was an Intel Celeron 333mhz which I upgraded by putting in another 32mb of ram and put a Voodoo 3000 card into for Counter Strike. Anyway wanting to make a few quid my dad suggested selling off the old Intel PI MMX 166mhz machine I still had. I told him I'd have to put the cpu fan back on, find the case side and reinstall Windows as it was in bits. Anyway no idea why but he decided to have a go at doing this himself which resulted in sparks and smoke, still no idea to this day which pins he had put the cpu fan onto. Needless to say the motherboard was fried and being a 5 to 6 year old PC just wasn't worth repairing. Great job!

My dad is forever using the SPACE BAR in Word or Excel instead of tabbing so whenever he goes back to edit something or changes font or size text jumps everywhere... don't get me start on tables or pictures either ha!

The biggest best and worst IT problem he has is using laptops which he and my mother switched to over a desktop when they downsized and moved about 6 years ago. We've tried Dell, HP, Fujitsu and Lenovo various models and different ages. About 6 months ago I had to replace a mouse pad and left mouse button on a HP G3 as he had broken them through anger when using MS Word.

Literally a motherboard out job just to change buttons and a pad... annoying build and design. His problem is using the mouse pad on laptops he always finds a way for his hand or wrist to touch the mouse pad causing the cursor to jump when he is typing. He always insists its the laptop and as he wants to use the laptop in his arm chair won't let me plug in a mouse.

Hope you guys have enjoy me Dad'isms and IT, I'm sure there's more but I dread the phone ringing and his number coming up. To be fair a lot of the problem these days just require me to jump on with Google Remote my mum can often find a way to negotiate a problem he's having.

547,Public announcement - Don't build an office in a concrete basement,"Few months ago, my client was doing a refurb of a few rooms inside a swanky downtown hotel.

They decided the carpark basement would make a great location for a site office. 

I was called to discuss internet options, I straight off the bat advised that a basement will be a very difficult place to run an office for comms, but was assured that the staff will make do with the realities of life in the basement.

I attend site, and as guessed, there was zero mobile phone signal, meaning options for running mobile internet are out. I discover that they have a booster signal for a particular phone provider, but it's weak as hell and unreliable as anything. 

I advise them to negotiate to have internet provided to them by the hotel or provision their own, this advice falls on deaf ears and Financial controller says they have a 4G site kit and let's test it out (because it's free).

I advise against it, but test it out, it's unstable as hell, but it works. I advise not to rely on this, and to negotiate internet connection with the hotel. I speak with and email all of the people involved advising to TEST THIS OUT and LET ME KNOW the results, so I can provide recommendations (which is to provision their own internet).

So a week or two goes by, people start arriving to the office, and our helpdesk gets complaints.. site users start emailing my boss saying this is ""unacceptable"" and I get ""What the hell is going on over there"" emails. I again, engage all of the stakeholders, repeat the previous message that this was a TEST PHASE because IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK and we SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but they ask .. ""What about the guest WiFi network?.. can't we use that?""

I advise THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK and YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PRINT WITHOUT SWAPPING NETWORKS and YOU SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but I go out.. find the PUBLIC WiFi signal isn't strong enough, and the GUEST network requires authentication. I leave stating they need to get a Guest logon for me to test, they say they will and get back to me, I leave.

They complain, saying the internet still isn't fixed and this is unacceptable, I say do you have the guest logon?, they say yes, I say have you tested it, they say no. So I go out, test it out, it's weak and pretty crappy, but usable.

I let all the stakeholders know, yes the guest network works but the signal isn't the best, you SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but they ask.. what about the public network..  Joe bloggs tested it and said it's fast, I say the signal strength isn't enough to reach in the office, so they contact the hotel asking for it to be extended.

So today, after this painful journey, the hotel agrees to be able to move the WAP that broadcasts the PUBLIC network (very fast) so we go out. My tech moves the WAP to near their office, connections are great, full signal strength fast internet, great. Only problem is they have to disconnect to use their printer, I have explained this several times and everyone has agreed.

  
Except for new Site Forman, never been involved, never spoken to anyone, self appointed head honcho says to my tech ""You aren't going anywhere till you fix this, if you can't fix it I'll find someone who will"". 

Baffled my tech calls me saying that new site forman is demanding we fix it (Fix what? I am thinking.. this is exactly what has been agreed to). I call Financial controller to get this guy in line.. he is on leave, I call office manager who said ""I don't really remember what the issues were.. could you go over it again?"" 

So I have to call this guy, listen to his heavy breathing and completely oblivious ramblings like Donnie from the big lebowski completely out of his fucking element, and I have to explain to him the realities of life. Then, out of the blue, he says he has approval for running cables out of the basement, into the golden sunshine to allow a mobile signal booster to be installed (this has been denied for two months that this was possible). So while I am organizing this, he sends an email to all people involved advising this is SUPER URGENT and UNACCEPTABLE and that the current options WILL SIMPLY NOT WORK.

After being ignored every step of the way, being forced to work with solutions that I KNOW will fail, and finally dancing to the beat and getting exactly what was agreed upon working, I get an ear full from someone who had not the time nor the inclination to get involved. Pure frustration in it's finest form, I have flash backs to that phone call that started with ""We are going to be building an office in the basement"" and which I had of hung up right there and then and gone on leave for two months.",False,2609,156,UpUpLeftLeft,talesfromtechsupport

We had an agile/smart working role out recently. 200 computers replaced with docking stations and converted to touch down desks that users book as and when they need them. 

All the old dual core Dell Optiplex 760s were replaced with HP Elitebooks 8gb RAM and SSDs. So users complain about laptop screens rather than appreciate they have a new superfast laptop with wifi they can use to work from home on.

Anyway a lot of the monitors were sat on top of the computers so now they are wrong height and a certain user kicked off big time. As a temp measure whilst waiting for a laptop/monitor riser we used a box file or told users to use a box or paper, not ideal but would be fine for a day or two whilst we get arms or risers. The user still kicking off writes an email copying in me, the accommodation lead, various HR reps and a project manager.

Needless to say one of HR managers was not happy and setup a quick meeting next to the users desk with me.

552,Memory Leaks,"So I flew back home a few weeks ago to visit my mom.  She had mentioned that her computer (stock '09 Macbook) was really slow.  No problem, I am glad to help.  The machine had 2GB ram and a 5400 rpm drive, so I brought a spare 8GB of ram and a 240GB SSD. I also planned to upgrade from 10.6 to 10.13, so she can run the latest and greatest.

When I arrived, we took a look together and she's correct: the machine was *crawling*.  Well, we all know that the first step is a reboot, to which Mom immediately objects:  


""You can't reboot it and you can't quit Firefox!"".    
Me: ""Why not?""  
""Because I'll lose that video of when your BIL proposed to your sister!""

Intrigued, I switched to Firefox and sure enough, there it is in a tab.  


""Mom... how long have you had this video opened?""

""Since it was sent to me.""

""So, like, two years ago?""

""Yeah, that sounds about right.""  
""And you haven't rebooted or even closed Firefox since?""

""I can't, otherwise I'll lose the video.""  


OMG  


I *do* see her logic: The 4k video itself would not play directly on her dated computer.  The browser was doing something to make it playable.  My BIL had said he would eventually take the video down, so she figured if she just left it open, she'd always have it.  The video file was over 1 GB in file size alone, and had been hogging her ram for literally years.  Not to mention all the memory leaks compounding the issue.  


So after much convincing,  I assured her that I could indeed get her the video and make it play on her machine without having to leave it open for eternity.  So we rebooted and naturally the machine was faster with the gift of some needed digital amnesia.    


To solve the video problem, I used Handbrake to downsample the video file and placed the file on her desktop, for future use.  

I had already planned to do upgrades as she was running 10.6 and her machine supports 10.13, so I did that too.   The hardware upgrades made a huge difference, of course.  


Now she really can run that video forever.

  
TL;DR:  Mom didn't reboot or close browser for two years; slowness ensued.

553,"I clicked download, why can't I save the file now?","Hey r/talesfromtechsupport! I started visiting this sub a couple of years ago when I accepted a position as a regional IT manager for a transportation company. We have a number of different systems that are legitimately difficult to use, mostly because our company infrastructure is awful, but that's a tale for another time. I admin, provide support and often jump in to help users if they get behind on something or aren't capable of doing it themselves. Today I had to help a user get through a procedure that is conducted quite frequently, payroll. You see, we have a time clock web application that interfaces with the physical clocks where employees punch in and allows the location payroll supervisor to edit hours, add vacation time, track sick days, ect. It isn't the greatest system in the world, but it works.

The characters in this tale:

$PS - Payroll supervisor that has been on site for nearly ten years and has been using the time clock app for 3 years.

$GM - General manager of the facility, helpful guy

$me - I bet you can guess

me:  This is the66fastback

PS: Hey the66fastback, this is PS from \[location\] I'm having an issue with payroll, can you help me?

me: Sure PS, what's going on?

PS: Well in the payroll report, I set up the dates and then I change the name for the CVS file

me: -to myself- It's .csv, but whatever

PS: But after that where it used to give the the option at the bottom of the screen to save, its not there no more.

I remembered at this point that I had instructed PS to start using Chrome in place of IE a week ago when they were having issues with the web app lagging. This fixed this issue right away and I hadn't heard anything else about it. As I'm sure everyone here is aware, in IE a user is given the option to choose where to save a downloaded file, in Chrome, the file is automatically saved to Downloads.

me: PS, I suspect this isn't an issue with \[time clock app\]but an issue with your browser. Which one are you using?

PS: Uhhh, I don't know.....

me: Chrome? Internet Explorer? Firefox?

PS: Its just, I don't know how to save it now, it used to say ""Save As"" but now it's not there.

me: I understand PS, I think your file is in your Download folder now, did you click ""Download"" at the end of your process?

PS: I uhh... I did the date and then changed the name and now I can't save it. It used to just show up on my desktop when I was done. 

me: Ok PS, if you have \[time clock app\] open in front of you, take me through it from the beginning, step by step and I'll direct you once we get to the part where you're having issues.

PS: I change the date, then I change the name and now I usually save it

me: Did you click ""Download"" after you changed the date? (Download is in the middle of the page)

PS: The only ""Load"" on the page is at the top right

me: -starting to get a little irritated- No, PS, ""Download"" you have to click ""Download"" and then your file will be in your download folder

PS: You want me to open my folders.... in the cloud?

me: No, just on your Desktop, same as always

My partner is a engineer for a large medical records and billing firm.

$hd: Alright, let's try to figure out what's wrong. 

$hd is a bit out of their league here, so escalates it to engineering quickly. They're used to resetting passwords and dealing with client interface issues, so this is fine. Engineering then takes over the call. 

$eng: Hi, yeah, we are trying to figure out why you're having issues. Can you see any of the file system? 

$client: No, it's not showing up! I think this thing [data locker] is busted!

Only been doing it for six months or so now, and my technical background is more hardware than software- I'll happily solder on some circuit boards, but right now, I'm doing Tier 1.5/2 stuff supporting a government facility. 

My facility was in the middle of a tech inventory, which meant by our policies we were going to be on lockdown for issuing or returning computers for a few days. Not really a big deal, as our stuff is (mostly) reliable, and we have a solid team to ensure we're not swapping a good machine for another good machine.

We are also the kind of facility that requires an Operations Center, the nexus of all sorts of high level, 24/7 manned goodness. People across the world call our OC at all hours of the day and night for any number of things. The government entity I work for has spots all over the world that make the OC a requirement to have manning all the time.

The second day of our inventory, I got a ticket in for a critical computer in the OC. It controlled some unique systems (Deliberate vagueness here) that were not used anywhere else on site, and possibly across our Gov't Entity. And the problem was, they forgot the bloody login!

Psht, no problem for a mighty IT dude with his wallet of admin credentials. Off I go to the OC to have a whack at this misbehaving machine. When I get there, I find it's an older box compared to most, and I settle in and slap it with my admin password.

*DENIED*

Wait, what? I tried twice more, checking my Capslock key and all that, and get denied every time. Before I can really mess with it anymore, LeadMan and TopGun charge into the OC. Both LeadMan and TopGun (LM and TG) are highly skilled in IT, and are the go-to guys for asking obscure information. You know the type I am talking about. Both are solid mentors. LM and TG came because it was a major OC issue, and apparently, the OC had called LM directly to let him know they needed this box up fast as possible.

I was pushed into the backseat (As was right to do on critical stuff) while LM and TG started working. I found out a few things fast from what they were saying- whoever set the computer up failed to set it up to Gov't Entity Standards, and it was not taking any of the default credentials or anything else. LM began to make phone calls to try and prep for a quick swap while TG hammered at the generic admin account with every password he could think of.

LM got off the phone, saying that our many-levels up boss would approve a transfer mid-inventory, but wasn't happy about it. The OC guy asked about the super unique software... which started another round of digging for info. The unique software was nowhere else, but on this machine, and OC guy had no idea where copies were. We sure as hell didn't. OC guy also said the person who put this software on and set this computer up was at some distant base, presently unreachable. TG threw his hands up at this stage, shoving back from the desk and saying he couldn't get in. So I asked if I could try, and got the go-ahead.

I leaned over the keyboard, and then asked the Sky GM for a Computers roll to figure out the password. Sky GM said sure, roll your computers skill, here's all the penalties.

*NAT 20*

The workstation gave a happy little chime and loaded up the admin page. LeadMan, TopGun, and OCGuy were all staring at me as I threw my hands up and said, in front of the entire OC, ""BOOM! I'm fucking GOOD!""

Both my LeadMan and TopGun demanded to know what the password was I had thrown in. I kind of grinned and said ""Well, we're in the Operation Center, so I tried 'operationcenter', and yanno....""

Hopefully this is the last Microsoft Office story I have for a very long time. TL:DR at the bottom if you don't want to read this.

# PREFACE:

So a bit of background information before I get into this story, **you can skip this if you have already read my previous story about MS Office**\- So I work at a company that sells and repairs computers. Very small company, the computers are more expensive but what we offer with us over places like Best Buy is warranty- free lifetime labor warranty for as long as you own the computer. It's really helpful for a lot of old timers because we're basically their IT Department. Problem is, consumers are stupid so we get stories like this every once in awhile where they expect the world.

# THE STORY:

It was another beautiful day at work! My manager and I were closing and we weren't too crazy busy during our last few hours in the store, suddenly we get a phone call... he answers it and then gets busy. Suddenly, another phone call- I answer, and boy- was I in for it once again.

&gt;$Me: *Company Name*, this is GrowingTech- How can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: Hi, I have this computer I purchased from you guys, but it keeps telling me I have to activate my Microsoft Office before I can use it?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: I can look up to see if Office was included with your computer, can I grab the name on the account?

So the customer gives me his name, and all seemed normal at first. **In case you don't know-** Office is not a free product. It may have been included on some old computers like Dell and HP back in XP and Vista days depending on what computer manufacturer had what deal with Microsoft, which has caused a lot of people to be pissed when they find out they have to buy it now because the common misconception is that it was once free... no, not the case.

Regardless, I look up the customer's profile. Our database shows a customer's history- every time they bring it into any of our locations, it keeps track and tells us what we did, why it was brought in, if they purchased anything, etc. I see that his computer was purchased back in 2014- wait... the dude is just finding out now he doesn't have Microsoft Office? I put him on hold for a bit and start searching his history, making sure we didn't do a reformat on the computer and never bothered to activate Office- nope- he's only brought the machine in for tune ups- and if you don't know what that is- trust me, it wouldn't have deactivated his Office.

I keep searching, finding that he has had no purchase of Office through us. I take him off hold and tell him my findings- and it went on from there.

&gt;$Me: Hi sir, I am back. I have went through your entire history from when you bought the computer to the last time you came into the company- we have no records of you purchasing Office. You'll have to purchase it in order to get that Activated so you can use it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: But... it's included on my computer! Nobody every told me it was a trial!

Actually- unless the person who sold the computer to this guy was a complete moron- we would have told the customer that. But this was 4 years ago, and why he is finding out he doesn't have Office now is beyond me- he apparently doesn't need it that badly but whatever, my personal opinion. Either way- this is the case of the Customer Conveniently Forgot An Important Detail disease.

&gt;$Me: We normally go over this information with our customers, I apologize but you will still need to purchase it in order to use it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: Well because it came included with my computer, I expect you guys to activate it for me.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Sir, Office by default of the Windows 10 Operating System comes included as a trial.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: I don't care, I want you guys to give it to me for free because it is on my computer.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me (Starting to lose my patience- did I forget to mention that I despise retail?)  : ....Sir, you could go to Best Buy or any other retailer that sells computers and buy a computer from them- but the trial edition still comes included on those computers as well, this isn't any different with our company. Office comes as a trial as part of the Windows 10 OS, you have to purchase it separately- this is the case of whether you go here or another retailer.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: I understand that but still- nobody told me about this and I expect compensation for that! Where's a manager?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: He is with another customer, I can take down your info and have him call you when you are free.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: Okay, call me at this number, I expect you guys to make this right- and I expect a phone call tonight.

I get off the phone with the customer, manager gets off the phone shortly after. I tell my manager who is rolling his eyes just about as much as I am at that point. I am so happy to work with a manager who doesn't give away free stuff for the sake of angry customers, he told me he would give the guy a deal and it would be $140, still expensive but not full price either- and we would be losing out a little on the license as we don't have any special deals with Microsoft either.

Well, manager calls the customer back... and what do ya know, he had to leave a voicemail! Customer never called us back and it's been almost a month since this happened.

So, not the craziest story- just a case of  ""Expressing my Entitlement"" type of story. Still- I hope my next story for this subreddit doesn't include Microsoft Office anymore.

Now a side note. The hardware appliance that was install earlier this week emails out daily reports with its name attached. It's twin does this also. I foresee when it goes into service and ""Insert Random Name"" emails start flowing to the recipients there will be another call to change it to something recognizably similar to its twin.

Me: Sounds fine to me but what issues do you think it's causing?

MSGuy: Not really sure but the previous IT guys here said something about windows updates

Me: I'll check it out

567,"Sorry, was that server important?","The year was 2014, I had been working 2nd line support for around 8 months fresh out of university. It was the final day for one of our Senior Developers before he left the business, he was handing over a number of products - one in particular was coming to me as I had been supporting it since beginning of my time there - the application was about a decade old, written in ASP Web Forms with a backing windows service to read an exchange mailbox, download attachments automatically and read/process the files within. The client for said application had a requirement in their business to respond to files within 48 hours or they would be fined *per violation,* and because of the requirement to read emails on their server, it was hosted in their data centre, not ours. 

**The players**

* $Me/$Op
* $SD - Senior Developer of $App
* $DM - Development Manager, $SD and my boss. 
* $CNA - Client's Network Administrator.
* $CAM - Client's Account manager, his boss. 

**Act I - Setup**

So 08:55 Friday morning. The phone rings, it's first line support saying they have an urgent ticket - not uncommon - I ask who it's for and they say they actually have $client-network-admin on the phone, can he be conferenced in. Alarm bells start ringing, I haven't even had my coffee yet - my PC is still logging in, but I take the call. 

&gt;$CNA: Hi, $Op, we might have a problem with $App.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Okay, whats going on  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Well all of the files we've received overnight haven't been processed, they're sat in the inbox.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Oh okay, let me remote onto the server and check it out.

I remote into the server and check out the service logs, endless stacktrace, the job to check the email inbox is continuously failing to make a connection. I check the settings on the app to ensure the endpoint and auth details are correct - no changes or unnecessary deployments made. I ping the mail server and get host unreachable - ah, the mail server is offline. But then I recall $CNA telling me he could see the mail in the inbox, how could he see that if the mail server was offline? I call him back 

&gt;$Me: I can see the problem, your mail server is offline, how is it that you're seeing the mail in the inbox?   
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Which mail server  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: ...what do you mean which mail server...?  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Well we migrated the mail server to our new Exchange box last night  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Did you perhaps do this at \*time logs started throwing errors\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Yeah that sounds about right.   
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: what did you do with the old exchange box?   
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Well we decommissioned it  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: You're going to need to restore that server, we cannot read the mail unless we can reach that server  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: We don't have backups, we're deprecating the box - we've been planning this for months, we have some old disk images but we don't have the hardware, we disconnected it from the rack last night, it's an ancient box and needed to be replaced.   
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Does anybody here know about this? Has $SD been coordinating the migration?  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: We didn't think we'd need to $App just reads mail from outlook right? The mail clients haven't updated, we just upgraded from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: I'm going to have to get back to you $CNA. 

**Act II - Confrontation**

I hang up and go to $SD who is just chatting with his desk buddies, enjoying the start of his final day. Explain the issue, his jovial expression is somewhat ruined. He goes straight to $DM and explains the situation. A loud ""THEY DID FUCKING WHAT"" booms across the office. $DM calls $CAM and takes the call into the meeting room.

In the meantime $SD and I work on seeing if we can get $App to start reading using the new version of EWS, as expected the 3rd party library we used to read EWS would not work with 2010 and the version that would work was so vastly different from our current setup that it would require a fairly extensive overhaul of a large part of the system, and by then we had 8 hours left in the working day. $CNA rings my phone I answer and patch in $SD

&gt;$CNA: So I've just had a chat with $DM and $CAM, they've said I should call you guys and see what can I do to help  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Well you can start by restoring that old box - we've got a few hours left, get it back on the rack, boot it up and do whatever you need to do to get that mailbox running.  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Ah, well, we've already redirected all of our traffic to the new box. If we boot up the old one all of our users are going to get locked out of their emails.   
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Can you make it so that only our account is routed to the old box?   
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Sounds like a tonne of work - would it not be easier to just upgrade $App to start using EWS 2010

My eye starts to twitch, but then (perhaps fuelled by the knowledge that he doesn't have to care once it ticks past 17:30) $SD chimes in.

&gt;$SD: Are you serious? You switched off an entire server which has housed one of the backbone features of $App for 10 years, you didn't tell anybody at our office you were doing this, your business is going to suffer as a result of this - not only is your job probably on the line for this blunder but I've been working with $CAM since this project started, and I wouldn't be surprised if she's going to be waiting in the car park to beat you up if this isn't sorted by CoB. So don't tell me it'll be easier for us to just upgrade an entire system to an untested, unknown framework. Get that server out of whatever skip you threw it in, get it back on the rack, boot it up, migrate our mailbox and tell us when it's ready to use! 

He slammed the phone down, I heard $CNA mention something about giving us an update in an hour or two and he hung up. There was a tense silence in the office when $DM casually said ""Do you feel better now $SD?"". Everybody laughed and $SD relaxed a little. 

**Act III - Resolution**

The rest of the day went somewhat smoothly. $CNA got the server back up and running, it took a few hours to migrate our mail to the old server and $SD, $DM and I did have to design some on the fly solutions to correct some issues which had been caused by failing to *send mail,* as $App for some reason expected everything to work first time, and had no fail safes in place for when things like email servers weren't there. 

At 5pm we switched the whole thing back on and all the mail pieces started to move, our outgoing mail was re-queued properly and all the data fell into place, crisis averted. 

$SD, $DM and the rest of our office then promptly left the office and went into the nearest pub. $CAM emailed us at 11pm to say that the mail had finished, thanking us for our help. 

**Animal house ending**

$SD - thrived at his new role, we keep in touch on LinkedIn.

$DM - is still as grumpy as ever

$CNA - amazingly kept his job. Thankfully he now informs us every time anything within their server farm changes. He and I have actually become quite good friends over the past 4 years and we have a fairly healthy working relationship. 

$OP - I oversaw the upgrade of $App to use EWS 2010, and after a thorough testing process made the switch. At which point the old EWS 2003 box could be safely thrown in the trash. 

$CAM - Had a great deal of respect and time for $DM and I since that issue. She may or may not have still beaten up $CNA in the carpark. ",False,2106,129,joeborder,talesfromtechsupport
568,The Cutover Part 2 - 250 is an important number.,"Why is 250 an important number? 

Because moving a router 250ft requires shipping it 250 miles away.

ITTS - The ISP that shall not be named, remarkably inefficient, significantly lacking in communication  

CART - The Clueless Asset Retrieval Team -  \*Sgt. Shultz\* I know nothing! I know nothing! 

$Me - Fulfillment expert and problem solver by working with a team of network engineers

  
So, we just observed the weirdest and most inefficient process ever seen by some of our most highly-trained logically-thinking network staff. 

[Previously on The Cutover](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/87as24/the_cutover_part_1/) we had the ISP - Internet and Telephony Technical Services Inc.  \[ITTS\] appear without our knowing for an install of a SIP gateway in the wrong spot 250 feet away from the demarcation point where the phone lines tie into the telephony room. 

We asked them to move it and they never did...

  
It's also been radio silence and our joyful and chipper sales rep who never answers emails or phone calls ~~how does he have a job?~~ did not or failed to inform us that ITTS wanted some equipment returned due to the cancelled and restarted SIP project.   
This week, we get a box addressed to the Asset Retrieval Rep but with our company address, shipping team is confused because Jan Smithe does not work at this complex. Somehow the ship team extracted from AR that it was from ITTS which then is delivered to networking.   


It gets better.   


We pull the shipment information packet and find an accurately detailed service order and parts inventory sheet, right?

Wrong! 

Expected weight 80lbs 

Part to be returned - Brocade SIP Box  

Serial - None

Part - None   


Ooookay... nothing ITTS has ever installed would ever come up to be 80lbs, and everything together that makes the SIP trunk work would weigh 20lbs at the most if we pulled the demarc unit, but that thing is bolted to the wall and has Do Not Touch per ITTS all over it.   


We also have 6 SIP boxes installed in the region pending this glacial-speed cutover, the simple question that never got answered - which one?   


Emails go out to the ITTS teams, the local sales reps, and directly to the AR rep. 

Phone calls ring to busy or voicemail and no one emails, responds or calls us back.   
We did get an answer from a tech rep but guess what was in his email? 

Internal work order/job numbers, the router hostname, and pretty graphics. 

There was no serial number, no model number, nothing pertinent to confirm or deny whether or not we sent the right stuff back. I told him that without that hostname or more accurate information, we would have had trouble confirming anything. 

Calling the aptly named Clueless Asset Retrieval Team reveals that ITTS does not communicate to them what parts are expected to be returned. I encourage them that this whole mess is a waste of our time and we are not responsible for any fudge-ups beyond that. 

  
I included a letter in the box about how obtuse the whole process is and to contact our sales rep if it is wrong.   


TLDR - All we need is for ITTS to move a SIP gateway 250 feet away, but how do they want it?

Sure enough, about ten minutes later my phone rings.   ""Hi, I can't log in, I have [insert something work-related] to do.   When will I be able to work?""

In my head, I first gave him the benefit of the doubt - maybe he hadn't seen my e-mail (they have mobile e-mail).  ""Did you see the email I sent?""

""Yes"", he answered.  

(ok, note to self: no more benefit of the doubt)

""The one that said I'd send an ETA when I had one?""

""Yes.""

More than a few years back, I was hired to help teach an acquaintance's parents the basics of computering over the course of a few evenings. They were a thoroughly charming couple in their 70s who had bought new Macs so they could see what this whole computer and internet craze was all about.

In my first session with Mom, she was doing quite well with the keyboard (she had learned to type back in the days of manual typewriters), but she was taking forever to get the cursor where it needed to be. Natural enough if someone has never used a mouse before, so I didn't think much of it.

Can I just mention here how wonderful Apple's clear buttonless mice were for people with arthritis in their hands? Just squash the whole mouse to click.

Anyway, in the second session she was doing great otherwise, but still having a lot of trouble mousing. I started to pay closer attention to what she was doing.

Turns out Mom was *driving* the mouse around, like a little car. In other words, instead of holding the mouse in a fixed orientation with the cord pointing straight ahead, she was turning the whole mouse and pointing it where she wanted to go.

Want to go left? Point the mouse to the left, start sliding it, and get distressed when the darn pointer shoots straight up.

When you think about it, it actually does make a little more sense that you would steer a mouse. Holding a mouse in a fixed orientation and sliding it around doesn't make a lot of natural sense.

*BACKSTORY: The organisation I work for is very unique we are public/government sector I have posted here a few times but my service desk basically does 1st line support, very light 2nd line but mostly info management/permissions. We are very restricted on money and what equipment we have, contractors and an external company handle 2nd and 3rd line requests. Anything plugged in such as a cable or USB device MUST be approved due to security and ordered only from our contractor)*

So my service desk had a user walk up about an hour ago and report they were having issues connecting a laptop to a monitor this morning. Could we please provide them with a VGA cable, seemed odd as pretty much everyone uses a HDMI cable or DVI cable with display port adapter The laptops do have VGA but seem pointless given a recent refresh of tech. Being a manager working to a tight budget where by we try not to give out consumables without charging I didn't just want to hand out cables and expect the users to resolve the issue.  We have limited VGA cables for projectors in certain rooms and our external supplier no longer supplies VGA cables. We cannot bring them from outside and plug in either as it's a security breach. Anyway as my team were all busy on other jobs I decided to go and have a look as it was on the floor below. 

Quick look and as you have guessed the user has basically gotten what looks like a DVI-I cable and removed the pins to make it fit into a DVI-D to VGA adapter. Needless to say this hadn't worked but the make matters worse they had stolen this off another users monitor. Now two cables down due to damage by user and theft of the original calbe I was left no alternative but to charge the team for two cables and report the damage.

He fires up Outlook 2010.

So he is actually describing it as he sees it.

At three minutes past midnight (by his wristwatch) all the emails in ""Date:Today"" move down into ""Date:Yesterday"", but because ""Date:Yesterday"" is collapsed, they all suddenly disappear. 

And after he has waited 24 hours, at three minutes past midnight the following day, they will reappear again, as they move down into ""Date:Wednesday"" which is expanded. 

And then he can reply to them!

I show up, and all I was told is mass outage for an unknown reason. I go into the server room, go over the check list. 

Everything physically on the rack and in the server room looked good. I go out and check the individual machines and everything was the same, no internet despite being jacked in. 

After an hour and a half of going through everything I could think too, and calling central IT to have them lend a helping hand...

I go back to the server room, pop a tile up on the ceiling, and peek, nothing looked wrong. 

I go further outside the server room with a flashlight and ladder, following the bundle of cables, popping up ceiling tiles..

I eventually found that the bundle split off for floors 1 and 2. Right before that split, I saw a cable management disaster. 

Upon closer inspection, it wasn’t a cable management disaster, it was all the cables being cut and tangled. 

Looking even closer, it wasn’t a clean cut, it was chewed by (hopefully) an animal.

My shift is about to end, as I come very early in the morning to office. I tell him it's okay just let my team know you have another issue and someone from my team who is in shift will help you troubleshoot this- *just stop* ***panicking -*** Jesus!

I explained him what needs to be done and what the issue was - but this guy is *so* stressed out he didn't understand a single word I said to him.

It's already beyond my shift and I understood that this guy has lost his cool. So, I take charge and tell him

&gt;Me : ""Sir, you need to calm down, its all gonna be okay. I can fix this for you (*as a professional courtesy*) ""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Just give me a System State Backup of any DC..""

&gt;SysAdmin : ""Backup? .. uh.. \*Takes a moment or two\* Sure, give me a second.""

\- No Response -

&gt;SysAdmin : "" I am pretty sure we backup using Symantec-""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me : "" It doesn't matter, as long as you can get me a SYSVOL folder from yesterday we should be fine.""

\* It's 30 minutes now- He is not able to find a good copy of SYSVOL, and I start to realize that he does not have one.

&gt;SysAdmin : "" Please give me some more time.. ""

\* I mute the phone, and I let my team-mates sitting beside me know that I need one of them to take this over as I am end of shift. As I explain them the issue and people start gathering around I tell 'em

&gt;"" Just so you know guys he doesn't have a backup. ""

Everyone in my team looses it after hearing that - "" Over 150 DC's and N0 Backups?!, Holy shit this admin! "" and out of annoyance start cursing him.

**I come to my desk and I realize my Phone wasn't muted.**

I hushed everyone and I nervously pick up the phone to apologize to him, hoping he didn't hear us as we were discussing this a few meters away.

&gt;Me : "" Hey \[SysAdmin\] I am really sorry about that, I just wanted to -""  
&gt;  
&gt;SysAdmin : Please \[Guy\], I am really sorry. Please help me, my CTO will fire me tomorrow morning if we don't get this fixed soon.   
\* Starts crying on the phone \*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me : "" Hey HOLD ON! \[SysAdmin\] You need to get a grip, we can fix this- it's not the end of the world. Let's see now- ""

This dude just starts crying on the phone and I was speechless- words escaped my mouth.

But by looking at the level of impact I would say he had this coming, I felt so much pity and guilt for him, I can't even explain.

So, I devise a plan of action, asked which DC has the most up-to-date policies- He takes another 45 minutes gives me a DC. I told him to take a nap as it was 3 AM by then for him. Picked his Hub site first where most of his clients were-

Made the good DC as ~~D4~~ *Authoritative* and started doing ~~D2~~ *Non Authoritative* restore on all other DC's.

Fixed almost two sites - about 50 DC's, woke him up- told him what's what and how to move on with this. Handed the call to my after-hours engineer and went home.

Never had an interaction with the fellow again.

578,The tale of the mysterious nightly phantom phone calls,"There's a TL;DR at the end for the impatient.

So in a previous life, I used to work for a Dutch phone company - a very old and well-known one. I started at the technical help desk for land lines, and later moved to second-tier work, handling tickets that the first tier put in. Mostly these were infrastructure related, so a problem with the line to the customer's residence, or the exchange.

One story in particular seemed to mystify a number of coworkers, and it mystified me at first until I found out what the problem was. A coworker explained it to me, and I've had the pleasure of explaining it to others since then. It goes a bit like this.

So the customer is sound asleep at night after a day of working and quality time with their family and pets. They are roaming around in dream land when suddenly, they are awoken by their phone ringing! Who can this be at this hour? When they answer, they hear nobody speaking at the other end. No record of the phone call in the phone, no caller ID. And this starts happening every single night and it drives them crazy, they unplug their phone, or feel they shouldn't and lose sleep... Very inconvenient!

Some customers and/or coworkers would suspect the phone company's exchange is faulty and is sending out weird phone calls because of a bug or something (spoiler alert: it's never that).

However, it might be a problem with a company with a shitty PBX that sends out phone calls. There is a call center I know of that had a problem with their queue filling up and when it overflowed, it would dump the entire queue and then start calling random numbers from its history, so this is not unheard of at all. So people would forward tickets to us to see if we could find out who is calling the customers.

Sometimes another little detail was added: the phone calls would happen exactly at midnight. Or they used to be but suddenly shifted exactly an hour and now it's still at the same time, only at some other hour. Here's where some of you will have figured out who the mystery caller is.

Is it the ghost of Alexander Graham Bell? Is it the customer's late grandma? Is it a computer somewhere? Is it hackers? None of these: it's the alarm clock functionality built into the customer's phone, that the customer accidentally activated because of crappy UI design of the phone. Once this happens, the phone starts ringing at midnight, because the wake-up time is 0:00 by default. As for the shift in an hour? Daylight saving time.

The best part is that in some of these cases, the customer would mention this weird bell symbol in their display and it wouldn't clue the help desk agent in (I would be a prime example of one of those agents).

580,Today my User was a pretty cool guy,"Although I am a Dev I occasionally do field support for one of our contracts, I cover the North of the UK while a counterpart in the South covers the other half of the country. 

Somebody called the helpdesk saying that their PC was displaying system time 01/01/2000 whenever they logged in, and it meant security certs weren't valid etc. It's becoming a more common problem as some of the PC's have been around a decade or so and the CMOS batteries are starting to die, so the clock resets every shutdown. The sites can reset the clocks themselves but as its a continuous problem we eventually need to replace the battery. While the tech setup is really low key - it's a medical workstation and has a fairly high impact and when a site can't access the system and needs to use the contingency, the slowdown in productivity can have some fairly dire medical consequences. 

On this occasion the site was slap bang in the middle of the country, technically I was closer by about half an hours drive away, which would be an all day trip out of the office - driving hundreds of miles to replace a battery. The guys on 1st line sent the CMOS battery ahead of time in the post, then called the local IT for the site and asked if they could spare a hardware tech to come out and replace the battery. They refused. We told them we accepted liability for any damage to the machine, and if they broke the PC entirely we'd have to come out anyway to replace it - so either way we had nothing to lose. They still refused on the grounds it wasn't their kit. 

Annoyed (but not surprised) I called the site to arrange a time I could go out and replace the battery myself. This is when I encountered something that had not happened before. I spoke to the medical professional - lets call him John -  explained the situation and asked when was best to come out; his response shook me. ""Just the battery on the motherboard? I've done that before - do you mind if I just have a go?"" I said yes, as whether he broke the machine or not I'd need to be heading out. ""Give me a few minutes, I'll go find a screwdriver"". 

He called back a few minutes later saying that he'd done the switch and the machine was keeping time; but he'd ring back next day to confirm it was working. Called me this morning first thing and said the PC was working fine, and we could close our ticket.

While this story doesn't really have a funny punchline; I thought I'd share it - because in tech support sometimes you just need that glimmer of hope that one day you will get a *John,* somebody who not only understands but cooperates and makes the job just that little bit easier. Thanks John.

581,You can't rename a mailbox like that,"Just finished up a fun little ticket, and thought I'd share with y'all in TFTS. 

The cast:

$Me: yours truly
$NMB: No MailBox, the poor user who is the reason this tale exists. They're an employee of one of my favorite clients (read: easy tickets and friendly, so easy money).

I was just wrapping up a ticket for another client when my phone dinged. It was from $NMB, and contained a screenshot of the error message, (another reason they're a favorite, they don't just click past errors) followed by the words, ""I think I broke something, help..."". The error states that Outlook cannot start because the PST file is missing. The file path is the usual ""C:\Users\$NMB\Documents\Outlook\$NMB@company.pst"".

I finish up my previous ticket, and login to $NMB's computer remotely. We start a chat session once I'm logged in.

&gt; $Me: *seeing that the error is now gone* Okay, $NMB, I don't see the error, I'm going to try and open Outlook.

&gt; $NMB: Okay. I was just scanning documents and renaming them before sending them out, but Outlook won't open now that I'm done scanning.

I click on the icon, and sure enough, the same error pops up. Navigating to the Documents folder yields a screen full of PDF's and Word docs, and probably 50 folders. Within the Outlook folder is probably a thousand more PDF's, each with a name like ""YY-MM-DD - Client A - Bid for Project X.PDF"". Overall, not a bad naming scheme, but why are they in the Outlook folder?

&gt; $Me: Why are these all in the Outlook folder?

&gt; $NMB: Oh, I put docs in there after I've emailed them, so they're out of the way. I don't like my Documents folder all cluttered (ironic since there's probably 150 files in it still).

While they're typing, I sort through the files in the Outlook folder. Sure enough, there is no file named ""$NMB@company.pst"" in there, so next is sort by file type. No PST files in the folder, damn.

&gt; $Me: When do you rename the files, before or after you email them?

&gt; $NMB: Oh, after! This is just my way of keeping track of what was sent when. I wouldn't send it like that! 

I set to scrolling through the folder, and notice that the file extensions are showing as part of the file name. One file stands out, as it has no file type. Its 46GB size fuels my suspicion of what's happened. Sure enough, it has the same naming scheme as the rest of the documents, ""YY-MM-DD $NMB@company""

&gt; Me: $NMB, I think I found the issue. *highlights suspect file*
Did you rename this file?

&gt; $NMB: Yes, I didn't like that it was the only file without the right format to it, so I renamed it.

I sigh, and rename the file back to ""$NMB@company.pst"". Outlook happily opens without a hitch.

&gt; $NMB: Thank you, my email is back! What'd you do to fix it?

I point out the name of the file and it's importance, and ask that $NMB not rename it. 

&gt; $NMB: but then it's going to be the one file without a date on it! Can you just change it so it has today's date in the name like I did?

Now, normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, as while it's unusual, it's a harmless request. However, since $NMB has decided that the Outlook folder is used for storage, I opt for another approach.

&gt; $Me: Would you mind if I just move it to another location, so it's not mixed in with your files at all? That way you can't accidentally rename it later.

&gt; $NMB: Will my email still work?

&gt; Me: ...yes...

&gt; $NMB: Okay, as long as it works, do your thing.

And now $NMB's email is tucked away in another folder, away from files they normally use. Outlook has been remapped to use that location. I'm just hoping the saying, ""if you make something idiot-proof, the world will make a better idiot"" won't catch up to me on this one...

Asana is a very intuitive task management software. Or so I thought.

One of my many responsibilities is to coordinate social media posts. We have a designer who makes graphics. We have a weekly call with the designer to discuss designs and messaging. I have two supervisors who need to approve the posts before I schedule them to be published.

I thought it would be simple to create a task for myself in Asana. The designer attaches the image. I write a caption. Then I tag my two supervisors in a comment that says, ""Please comment if you approve of the image and the caption.""

Straightforward, right?

And yet, my supervisors-- who are both in their 40s, so they have used computers their entire adult lives and have no excuses-- consistently fail to comment and mark my tasks complete so they disappear from my workflow.

585,A Sound Concept,"I work in the entertainment industry. Not in top-class theatre like Broadway or West End (but I can dream!) But my company likes to pretend we’re Broadway quality. My typical role is ~~backstage ninja~~  ~~professional grunt~~ stage hand, but I’m training up to Light Pro if I can ever get my mind around maintenance. Without breaking it.

A quirk of the theatre I work in is that we have three different types of “events”; our Company-provided Shows that run regularly, guest entertainers that appear once or twice, and outside group events. Typically, it is the last that provides the biggest headache, as these poor outside groups do not understand the complex concepts of theatre, or even the more basic ones. 

Take $ForeignGroup for example. Many of our groups will have some sort of rehearsal or pre-inspection to learn the venue, discuss set up and configure settings. Not these guys. They just showed up, set up two laptops with a splitter provided by our A/V team and expected it to work. And then complained because they couldn’t hear anything. At least, not like they expected it. ($ForeignGroup, fittingly, only spoke a few words of English. Contrastingly, the Backstage team only spoke a few words of their language. This made communication…difficult. Also, they didn’t provide a technical rider in English so we had to guess changes in parts of their presentation/speakers as the conference ran. Live.)

*A brief aside to explain sound systems; In your typical theatre, most of the speakers/monitors will be pointed out at the audience. There are a select few pointed at the stage or to the wings so that the cast and crew can hear themselves and the music, but only a few so that we can still hear each other and not kill our hearing after three months of show. Most speakers only throw sound in a single direction; you can try this yourself with a computer speaker. Stand in front of it, to the side, then behind it. A sound level will sound different between the Wing, the Stage, and the Audience despite showing one level at the desk. All sound levels in the system are controlled from the Sound Desk, which is out in the House. What the Sound Tech hears, you hear.*

$ForeignGroup did not understand this. They would turn to me (The backstage grunt assigned to communicate between $LaptopLady in the wings and $SoundGuy at his desk) frequently and ask for us to turn up the volume because “They couldn’t hear it.” They would turn the sound on their laptop to the maximum level, blasting any poor soul sitting out in the audience while it remained blissfully quiet backstage. Our poor system was being strained to the breaking point because our $SoundGuy couldn’t anticipate the $LaptopLady changing the volume on her laptop and adjust accordingly.

I finally had enough. I wiggled between the tables and the wall to a portable audio hotspot that sat in a corner. It works like the overhead speakers attached to the system, but this one has its own volume control. I turned the volume knob just a tad, until its level reflected the level of the sound onstage.

&gt;$LaptopLady: That’s perfect! Thank You!

That’s right. I just fooled the $ForeignGroup into thinking I controlled the entire sound system with a single knob. I hung my head, updated $SoundGuy, and tried to contain myself every time $LaptopLady adjusted her own volume to mute a video when it finished rather than let our sound guy do the work. They were frustrating for other reasons, but this was the one that blew me away. 

After that I figured out how to communicate the concept of Sound to other groups in simple English. (And thankfully, with our amazing translator/Group controller in the room-she’d stepped out when I was trying to work with $ForeignGroup.)

586,"Interrupt me, berate me and demand to do as you say? Enjoy not getting paid.","So, a bit of background. Two or so months ago, my company migrated our exchange log in, as well as our time tracking, and just about every other thing to SSO.

Some people are still having issues coming to terms with it, and have elected to ignore the weekly emails telling them to update their profiles with their current contact info, et cetera.

Enter condescending, old i-want-your-manager type woman. I'll call her S for this story. I'll be M. 

S: I can't log in to timetable website to update my W2 form. HR said they are withholding my payment until I submit the form, and the stupid website says I have the wrong password, which is what I've always used. Just reset it for me. 

M: hello S, I would just like to remind you that timetable website was migrated to SSO, so please use yo-

S: are you deaf? I said reset it, so chop chop. 

M: in trying to tell you that the password you've always used changed as o-

S: All I want to hear from you is ""yes ma'am"" and ""here is your password"" 

By now. I've noticed that her profile is incomplete. Or rather, it is half assedly filled in. Her contact number is 123456789, with no alternate email, nor her extension number. Part of our verification process is to match the caller ID number, with the one on her profile, or to send a OTP to either her work or alternate email. On password resets, we can bypass the OTP and just reset the password and have it emailed to their work or alternate emails, since their active session will allow them to receive it and later update it. 

M: I have sent your password to your work email. 

S: can't you read it off to me? 

M: no, unfortunately the number you are calling from is not listed on your profile, you will have to retrieve it from your email. 

After a bit of angry muttering, she comes back. 

S: outlook is popping up with a password thing, it wont update. 

Oh shit, she didn't have outlook open, thus no active session. Dis_gon_b_gud.gif

M: unfortunately, the only alternative I have is to resend your password to your manager. 

S: She is on maternity leave. NOTHING WORKS NOW, I CAN'T LOG IN TO ANYTHING WHAT DID YOU DO! 

M: exactly what you asked me to do. I reset your password. 

S: I TOLD YOU I ONLY NEEDED IT FOR TIMETABLE SITE! 

M: yes ma'am, you did. And I told you it was part of the SSO. I even tried to get you to try your current network password, but you demanded I reset it anyway. 

S: I have to turn this in today, I can't wait for my manager to come back. 

M: I can email her manager, explaining the situation, and you can try to contact them about it as well. 

S: that is idiotic, why are you doing this to me?! 

M: I simply did as you demanded. 

After a lot of angry bargaining, she came to terms with the fact that I was not going to help her, and reluctantly agreed to contact her managers manager. 

Thing is, when I sent the email after I had released the call, I got an out of office notification from him. He is out till the end of the month. 

Enjoy!

So her HR point of contact wrote to the HR head of department, who in turn copied the Service Desk GM, who in turn wrote an email directed to all of us asking for more insight.

I got the call ID, and wrote my side of the story. Since her profile is still locked as of now, I was able to retrieve screenshots of everything, which were attached. I explained that it was my intention to contact her again, to let her know that the manager I contacted was also out of office, but due her profile not having any reliable contact information, I was unable to do so. I noticed that an external @publicdomain account was CC'd. I assumed it was her. And because I work in an office environment, I don't know the difference between reply and reply all. So I hit reply all.

What followed can only be described as divine. GM instructed the Service Desk team to immediately direct any caller identifying as S directly to HR. This one was sent only to us. A ""separate, detailed e-mail"" will be sent to HR, and they are to handle her until further notice.

I had a 20 minute or so meeting, with my manager and GM on the line. They asked why I refused to look for alternatives. I explained that in my experience working at American Express, I saw a lot of social engineering attacks that followed a similar pattern, with no verifiable account information, and an overly aggressive user demanding information on the account. I expressed that I had a gut feeling that someone was trying to exploit a weakness in the service desk, and decided to stick to the guidelines and exhaust all established options, including having the alleged user meet with their manager.

$CIT: yea this is $CIT and $C here, here is her $info, and as you heard, she cannot log in.

$me: oh, ok, so what are you trying to log into

$C: everything!

\*\*keep in mind that we use about quite a few systems University-wide and each department has their own, on top of that some have different passwords/usernames\*\*

$C: NO 

$CIT: she can't log in anywhere, she just told you that.

$me: ok, let me look over a few things \*\*mutes phone\*\*

$C: \*scoff\* wow, he has no idea does he?

$CIT: Yea those $primary-HD people are really the bottom of the barrel. They don't know anything, just, they are they are the only ones who can do anything with passwords. Sorry you have to deal with him.

$me: \*internally\* well, that's swell. 

Then I notice that the username has NO attempts to log in. No incorrect passwords. Nothing. No access attempts for the entire day.

$me: \*I take myself off of mute\* oh, so I actually don't see any attempted log ins at this time

$C: I am trying to log in right now, did you see THAT?

$me: no, I didn't, but I think I know the issue; $CIT and $C, can you check if the caps lock is on? As you know all of our usernames are case sensitive.

\*\*a hush\*\*

$C: ok I can log in now, thanks.

\*\*I am not done yet\*\*

$me: oh, and just so you know, as your $CIT said, ANY technical issue can be solved by reaching out to YOUR $departmental-HD. We do have training and most have A+ certifications so we can troubleshoot a lot of issues, but the $departmental-HDs have requested to cover any issues you may have, that is why as $CIT said, I am pretty much just a password person. ... anything else?  
$CIT: no... thanks

592,Hide and seek with Exchange DB,"It's been almost a year since I started working for the current company as our only sysadmin and besides backups, disabling users and adding new users and the other usual stuff my work on the Exchange Server has been rather low. The wiring inside the server room is a disaster but it should stay as it is, as one of my predecessors must have screwed it up somehow while trying to fix it. So just keep in mind that it looks really messy on the backside of the server racks.

---------------------

In this story the RAID I'm talking about is a 1+0 RAID.

-------------------

It is Sunday, 30 minutes before the game Germany vs Mexico as $boss calls me to notify me that her E-Mails aren't working. I log in to OWA of our Exchange, it synchronizes but when I try open any E-Mail I get http 500 error after a while....strange. I contact some of my colleagues on random messenger and ask them whether they can read any E-Mails. They confirm they can but $boss wants a solution now. Fine...I drive over to work and boot up my pc.

I'm greeted by Updates being installed...GREAT! I go into the kitchen, get myself some coffee and come back. Still updates...seriously? Fine, I didn't have lunch, so I head to the gas station 20 yards/meters away and get myself some sandwiches. Still updates...ugh, this is not going to be my day is it?! Fast-forward another 10-15 minutes, sandwiches eaten, dump taken, spotted a cat outside, playing with it...update were finally finished. If you wonder why I didn't just go into the server room, the answer is a) I was in no rush, I'm missing the game anyway b) I hate standing while working c) Our air conditioning unit is crap and cannot cool the room down below 30°C/86°F, so now way I'm going into that hell. Yes, this was reported to $boss, but no she isn't upgrading the unit or calling the maintenance-company. $boss is beyond my comprehension of stupid, I stopped trying to understand her after about 2-3 months of being there.

Back to the issue. So I remote onto the server and just reboot it and pray. Still cannot read any E-Mails. Okay, I guess I gotta go into that hellhole and see if any of the HDDs died. It did, the red light is laughing at me (""Oh, you not going home so early, fella!""). I check the RAID settings, yep, it's gone. I pull the crap out with some difficulties as I'm clumsy and already frustrated. I reboot the system again, hoping the malfunctioning HDD might have caused some weird error or so. I use the time to walk down to my PC again. But nope, again no improvement. Actually, I started getting ""The administrator has done bla bla"" and nothing was loading at outlook. Ummm what?

Ok ok, keep calm, there has to be an explanation for all this. I head back to the server room to see if any other HDD just went bonkers, but no. *Mixed sigh of relief and confusion*...*heads back down again*

Remoting back onto the server and see that the Active Mailbox is gone. The DBs for Archive and public folders (I know, I know, don't ask, this is a story for itself) are still there. *Turning pale* What the...? Why? HOW? We had a malfunctioning HDD before at our PDC. I pulled it out, ordered a new one, it arrived 2 days later and I put it in and let the RAID rebuild itself. Success. But how can a DB disappear if just one of the two HDDs of that RAID is gone? That's impossible (at least as far as I know). At that time I started grasping at straws as that pretty much tilted my brain. I ordered a new HDD to be delivered ASAP, and started planning on putting the last backup on that new RAID and hope it would reappear again (I knew this was wishful thinking, but I had no idea what was going on). I drove home, telling $boss there wont be any E-Mails for a while.

The next day, I tell that to the person who helped out a bit around one of my predecessors. He walks into the server room and comes back and asks me:

&gt;$Coworker: Did you unplug the external HDD from the server?

&gt;$Me: The what?

&gt;$Coworker: The exchange server had an external HDD in the back. Did you unplug it?

&gt;$Me: I didn't even know that there was one.

&gt;$Coworker: Well, the Active Database is on that.

&gt;$Me: WHAT? But why? Why out of all the 3 databases we have, why put the most important one on an external HDD with no RAID? Who came up with that idea?

&gt;$Coworker: Well, we did, after your predecessor quit and the databases were growing too big for the RAID.

Fast-forward few hours of plugging it back in, fixing the DB-inconsistency that was caused, the E-Mails started working again. Somehow we assume that I must have ""unplugged"" a rather loose external HDD while getting the malfunctioning HDD out of the server, shaking the whole thing a bit. The loose external HDD was probably the cause of the initial problem too, as we found no other explanation for it.

-----------

I don't have many years of experience under my belt. So if you can, refrain from roasting me for something I've done wrong and rather say what I should have done instead. We actually ordered 2 HDDs to finally have 1 as backup. Before $boss saw no need in ""wasting"" money for something that just dusts up in the storage room. And I hope you enjoyed the story.

593,Who Needs Windows Updates; We Don't Need No Updates,"Time for a fresh story I've been working the last four to five months.

**Backstory:** So we have this client that we have done work for off and on for several years, mostly major implementation help and recovery services in VM. Over the course of time they seemed pretty good on what they are doing once we turn it over till a few months ago and we were asked to do a check-up on their environment and give some recommendations.

**Cast: Me - No explanation**

**IT Director**

**DBA**

Back oh about the first of the year our client asked us to come in and give a once over of their environment and offer up some recommendations for best practices. It kinda went like this.

&gt;Me: First thing that we noticed needing immediate attention is a majority of your servers have either never been updated or haven't been since we installed them three, four, five years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;IT Dir: We update our environment on a regular basis with WSUS in SCCM.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well I'm here to let you know that each of these servers and here is the list of last known updates haven't been done since X time. Also sampling your desktops they haven't been updated in years either.  
&gt;  
&gt;IT Dir: We will look into this and get back with you.

At this point months go by and we get called back out to right size the ship and get some of the updates in order. It was at this point we scheduled with them and their Sys Admins to work up a plan. We setup a few dates during the day to work on updates on systems that can be rebooted during the day and another set of dates and times for servers needing to be rebooted after hours.

It was at this point the DBA got involved, someone who we felt knew about the DBs but nothing on the environment in which it was working upon. They give us a couple action items like manually restarting specific services after reboots, etc.

The days come and we set to work with the on-site staff. Several days in this happens.

&gt;DBA: You broke the ""application"" you need to take off all the Windows Updates and service packs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: We asked for a list of dependencies and applications to be aware of, you gave us, XYZ and ABC. Nothing was mentioned about ActiveX and .NET  
&gt;  
&gt;DBA: Well all the updates need to be removed to make our applications work

It was at this point it went through a back and forth of explaining the process of updating Windows Server and software for security, features, etc.

This didn't seem to sit well with the DBA and they didn't seem to understand they would need to update their applications accordingly. Some of them from what we found a decade plus old using insecure technologies/programming and EOL SQL Server.

In the end, the IT Dir sided with the DBA and didn't have them update their applications and had us remove all Windows Updates.

**TL:DR;** DBA didn't think it was imperative to update their applications and it was better to run a production environment on insecure and in some cases EOL systems.

Side note: About a month maybe six weeks after this all went down, their main file server got hit with a cryptolocker and spread to a couple other systems including their on-prem Exchange. It was a 30 - 35 hour recovery job.

594,How TFTS saved the day,"Hi all, long time lurker happily reporting that TFTS indeed is the best of the best, and saved the day for some friends of mine recently.


You see, my two friends run this company. Just the two of them. They instruct people in how to do things. Things to do with animals. They know what they are talking about when it comes to that; their tech? Not so much. So when they had a presentation as part of their work, they had it well tested. And still they ran into a massive problem.


The first laptop would suddenly restart before loading the presentation. Bit of a panic, but hey, they have another one. Prepared for sucess, these two. Strange, because it worked the night before. Still, time is ticking, just boot the other one and fix later. But... The same thing happens with this second laptop. Panic is in the air. I get hijacked away from the coffee stand to see if I could get it to work. 


Intructor One promptly (and quite skillfully) connects the laptop to everything it is supposed to be connected to, and starts typing to load up the presentation. It reboots. She swears a little. I am perplexed; there was no warning, no error message, it had power, battery is full... Hm. Interesting.


It was then I remembered one of You figuring a similar case out not too long ago. My lurking is about to pay off. I ask Instructor One to please remove her watch - a Fitbit/smartwatch type of thing. Lo and behold! Taking off the watch stopped triggering the sleep function! The night was saved, I got oooh's and aaaah's from the customers that was close enough to enjoy the problem-solving, and we all had coffee. The presentation went on without a hitch and all had a good time.

599,"We're Army STRONG, not Army Smart","LTL, FTP, yadda yadda. Love reading stories here. Keep up the good work. I don't know how to format, so hopefully this comes out okay.

I have worked for the US Army as a contractor on and off for about 8 years. Even when I was in, I knew that a lot of what we did just didn't make sense. On the outside looking in, it's nice to not be a part of most of the nonsense. But sometimes I still have to deal with it. My previous time as a civilian has been as an instructor, operator of simulators for instruction, and somewhat maintainer of such machines. Now, all I am responsible for is maintaining the systems with help on instruction only if necessary.

One day last week, my coworker and I powered on and prepared all the simulators for the day's events. It usually takes less than an hour for both buildings, and we both get in at around 0730, ready for school to start at 0830. Our normal routine is complete, and we are both in our respective offices. Instructors and students begin entering the building and settling in for some good ol' training.

About a half hour into training, my coworker comes into my office and says there's a problem that he needs help fixing. He technically outranks me, but is a little newer to the maintenance of the systems. He used to be an instructor, so he is adept at operating the simulators in support of the training, but not necessarily on the troubleshooting side.

me = me

cw = coworker

&gt;cw: Hey dude, can you come look at the simulator. There's a lot of beeping, and some computers and projectors shut off.  
&gt;  
&gt;me: Did you check to make sure the UPS are on and receiving power?  
&gt;  
&gt;cw: Of course I did. I don't know what it could be.

I forgot to tell you, the simulator consists of two projectors, a large rack with shuttle computers on shelves inside of it, two UPS, and a main power source. I don't even know what to call this thing, but it provides power to the UPS. It's super old, too.

&gt;me: It sounds like the UPS are not receiving power. That's what happens when they beep like that.  
&gt;  
&gt;cs: Well, I don't know. I hooked up everything like normal and it's not working.

So we go down the hall and I hear the beeping which definitely tells me that there is a power problem. When I enter the room it is plain as day. The instructor plopped his bag down right in front of the main power source and toggled the switch down. I moved his bag and turned the switch back on. The instructor was notably embarrassed and apologized for the bonehead move, and my coworker facepalmed himself for forgetting that while he may have done the right thing in setup, users will inevitably undo that work in some fashion.

This brings me to my previous point of nonsense. Since I began doing this kind of work, we have always been mandated to shut off the UPS and the main power source every day. I do not understand why. When I have asked, the main answer at all the places I have worked has been to protect the equipment from surges due to lightning strikes. I do not know if that holds any water. I am not a true IT dude.

The problem that I have seen recurring is that the simulator throws errors. There are licenses that are distributed throughout the system when it is powered on, and they are dependent on a proper date/time to work. But because we always turn the power off, the CMOS batteries in the shuttle computers die, and the dates for the computers go back decades (I might be exaggerating that part).

So every few months, depending on how much use the simulators get, licensing will fail and we will have to manually set the date/time on each computer upon every start up until we get new CMOS batteries. I do not know why we do this to ourselves. These expensive ass Tripp-Lite UPS surely have surge protection.",False,488,56,JNBFD,talesfromtechsupport

For instance, if a client wants us to import data from their ADP system into one of the services we offer, we don't want to create a one time import process. We want to create a generic import process that will accept ADP formatted exports. Even better would be if we could specify the format of the import file, then we could create one generic process for all future requests but that never happens.
    
So one of our services we offer is that we can take clients HR Data and use it in our trip approval process. We get HR Data indicating who is whose manager and send out approval emails required to be actioned prior to flights being booked within certain parameters. Well, one client indicated that their HR department was unreliable and so they wanted us to hard-code in the approvers for a few employees. I pushed back, as a few years down the line someone was going to wonder why the approval went to the wrong manager but alas no one listens to Kik.

So now I'm off to get a keyboard. Ok, external monitor and keyboard connected, let's try again. F1 for BIOS and I'm in. Yup, the BIOS thinks it's a few seconds after midnight on Jan 1, 2001. Set it to the current date and reboot again.

Still complains about date and time... Yup, it's Jan 1 again. Bypass it... finally will I get somewhere with this?

Nope! Windows won't boot. Putting this one aside for now...

603,"App Team, Shmap Team","Okay, so, context. I work at a large org, 400+ apps in use, 600+ *internal* IT staff to keep the whole shebang running. More if you count contractors. Anyway, I work the help desk. We're the nexus, the air-traffic control of all user complaints. We're not on script and we're not judged on call metrics. There are no tiers within Helpdesk, but we are split into phone agents and roving agents. We send rovers for hardware issues or networking issues that stop us from remoting into the user's computer. The REST of the IT department is made up of 25ish different app teams. When we've run thru everything we've got, we can escalate to an appropriate specialized team, who may need to reach out to the vendor, or tweak a setting in the global setup or whatever.

&gt;  
&gt;Shmo: I'm having a problem in \[APP.\] Can you remote in and have a look?  
&gt;  
&gt;Mayo: Certainly, may I have your Asset ID?

So I remote in. I try all the basics, close the app and restart, clear the server side session, check all the clear all the device temp files, group policy update, checked the secure network connection, I pull up my documentation of 'Common Issues' for that app, provided to us by each app team so we don't bug them with the common quirks of their own system. Try all of that. At no point does the user try to stop me or say 'I tried that already.' Remember that, it will be important. I finish all of that and try some stuff I'm making up as I go to figure out *what the hell is up with this system?*

Finally, I hit the limits of my access. I can get no deeper into the \[APP\] with my permissions.

Meaning he had all the same ""Common Issues"" documentation I has, and then some. Meaning I just spent half my last call troubleshooting his own app for him.

604,The Network That Could Not,"So, here's a story that took place a couple days ago.

Backstory: I work as a pseudo-IT in a small company dealing in office supplies. Basically ""make sure everything works"" kind of guy after the proper IT left. Anyway, we get to the story.

'Twas a calm morning before shitmas. Or shitfest, as one prefers to call it. Nothing stood in our hero's path. The morning coffee was good, the sandwich he made back at home was tasty, and there was absolutely nothing to do so he could disappear in the hellish fires of Mt. Server Room to play some Quake 3 Arena. However, the yelling that came from the Land of Office Witches made him suspect that something went wrong.

**DRAMATISATION**

&gt;Office Witches: Oh, artixerix, where art thou, for my remote desktop cannot worketh!

&gt;artixerix: Worry not, beautiful witches, for I come to help with my shining Cat-5e cable and glowing Thinkpad X220 of IT Services +5!

**END OF DRAMATISATION**

Becoming more serious, the hero headed out to the dreaded computer that one of Witches had problem remoting into. Interesting enough, network seemed fine. It was visible on the network, however it had no internet connection.

&gt;Me: I shall pingeth this fsck-ed piece of equipment!

Of course, outside of **FATAL ERROR** nothing else has become clear. Nmap? Turns out nothing. Could it be ethernet adapter? No, works after having IP assigned automatically instead of static *as it usually does*. With that knowledge, artixerix suspect that it must be the job of his arch-nemesis, **the previous IT guy**.

The previous IT was a kind of fellow that had wide knowledge in the arcanes of IT, but he shareth that with none. He conjured a network from ground up, but left no magic books behind for artixerix to understand how it worked. Armed with that (lack of) knowledge, artixerix headed out to a different part of the building to run Nmap there. Surprisingly enough, something turns up! Even more surprising, it's...completely different device than intitial PC, happily occupying the same IP that PC had assigned.

&gt;artixerix: What kind of hellish spawns disrupt this calm network in such ways?!

Of course, it all became clear soon.

It turns out that arch-nemesis, the ""format"" to artixerix's C:\ drive, the ""sudo rm -rf "" to his \home, the fsck to his perfectly working drive and filesystem...didn't know how to set up switches. 
Better yet, from the office part of the building you can't see rest of the network (it's still on the same subnet), but you can see **EVERYTHING** if you plug into a switch that's in a different part of the building.

After finding out that information from long lost scrolls of past, artixerix makes a round around the magical land to assign a static IP for EVERY device in the kingdom.

Thus, the day was saved. Princess found her prince, demon forces were sent to the shadow realm, and artixerix went back to Mt. Server Room to get his asskicked with K/D 3/10 in Quake 3 due to playing on TrackPoint(TM)-styled pointer.

TL;DR previous IT is an idiot who can't set up switches, artixerix still has no idea how they work but finds a workaround.",False,216,47,artixerix,talesfromtechsupport
605,The chance of failure is high with this one,"Hi all! I wanted to share a story from a previous employer. We weren't a hosting company, but we had some virtuals running customers' systems, mostly because we had inherited them from new customers. The company I worked for was dying, the writing was on the wall and the company owner was desperate getting new customers, ANY new customers. As a last ditch effort he hired a new sales guy as the old totally useless one had just walked.

The new sales guy comes to me on his second day. He tells me he has scored us a client. I look the client up and oh, it is somewhat (locally) known company that has their own web shop in addition to physical store. The deal goes through and the migration for their web shop begins. I was expecting getting an intact virtual machine, but instead I'm told I'd be only getting SSH account to the dedicated virtual where the shop ran and was supposed to move it on file level. I groan, install a fresh virtual machine with matching OS and examine the old setup. Nothing fancy there, just a well known CMS with some custom parts added. 

At that point I'm contacted by the customer's IT guy. I tell him I'm ready for the migration on next Saturday. He says it sounds good and off we go.

Saturday comes. I move the database and the files without problems. I see the site is running fine on its new home and leave it at that.

The next monday morning I get an angry call from the their IT guy. He asks if I had installed it. What 'it'? The migration. I'm at a complete loss here, until it becomes clear he doesn't know what migration means. I suddenly get this sinking feeling that rest of this gig is going to be very painful.

The problem is that when new items are added to the store, they don't show up anywhere. The customer makes several really angry and ranty phone calls to us, while I scratch my head at the whole thing. Then I learn the sales guy has taken off, apparently he found a better job (or he learned about our company's declining state) and he's no longer working as a buffer between me and the customer. Thanks a lot!

No one knows anything about the web store itself, it's a extensive modification to the CMS and for what I see, it isn't very pretty code. It isn't even a proper module, it's more like cancer that has grown over all parts of the system. I also can't find any kind of interface to manage the products, just the CMS control panel and there's nothing there. I try asking the IT guy how exactly they add new items to the store. He tells me to enter the numbers to the browser. I'm at loss, what numbers? He gets angry and tells me just to start typing the numbers, the rest will show up. We go around with this, until I can convince him to take a photo of his screen.

Aha! He enters an IP address as an URL. Turns out there's a second virtual machine no one told me about. No one knows any shell account passwords there nor where it actually is. At this point we're long into monday and the customer is already nuclear because they wanted some products added to the store that went on sale today. I examine the database from the old installation and behold, the changes are there. I pull the added pages from there, find couple of pictures added on the file system and the customer quiets down for a while, but the IT guy is still yelling at me because we're incompetent and botched up the simplest thing.

Tracking down the company that made the web shop modification to the CMS was another thing. The customer didn't know about it and I learn that they are a couple that just bought the company. I track down the previous owner, he tells me his son's friend has a company that made it. I contact them, turns out it's just a bunch of young hotshot 'web dev' kiddos. The interesting tidbit I get from them however is that the IP address for the product management interface is on their server. I ask for the files, but they refuse, telling me it's their proprietary system. They however are willing to change the IP address where the product manager connects and after opening the MySQL port for their IP (which I strongly object about) and adding a shell user for their script, the products are now added to the right installation.

But behold, it still doesn't work 100%. The system has all kinds of random glitches, like wrong pictures showing up, broken pictures, some pages just crashing etc. The customer gets angry again and makes so angry call to me that I have to tell them I'm not taking that level of abuse. I dive into the horrible spaghetti they call PHP code and come to a conclusion that this can't work as-is, this must've been a pre-existing condition. I tell the customer's IT guy that I'm not touching that web shop, let the one who made it fix it and give the web dev guys' phone number.

After couple of days I receive patches to the code. They arrive in a form of a JPG file, that's a screenshot of some Windows based text editor with some lines underlined and instructions to change this and that in the code. I groan and make the changes, the web shop now somewhat works as expected.

Couple of weeks later I'm called into a conference call with the company owner, customer's IT guy and the customer's wife. The wife rants at us for at least 30 minutes, almost without any breaks, about how stressful dealing with us has been, how she expected more, how they were promised smooth transition by the now departed sales guy and so forth. The IT guy gets in couple of half-sentences like 'that's what I've been saying...' and couple of 'yeah's. 

I just look at my boss with a 1000 yard stare and have no words any more.

I quit a year later, when I finally found something else.",False,157,20,reject_85,talesfromtechsupport

Story 1

&gt;Teacher: Sonny?

&gt;Me: Yeah?

&gt;Teacher: can you connect me to the internet on my phone please? 

&gt;Me: uhh. Sure?

&gt;Me: no, no. It is. The WiFi symbol in the top left  
hand corner means its connected. 

&gt;Teacher: oh. Thanks.

&gt;Teacher2: Sonny. How do I make the video on the whole screen.

&gt;Me: you click the rectangle in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

&gt;Teacher2: *starts scrolling down through the comments to get to the bottom* 

&gt;Me: (in my head) Jesus. What the hell.

&gt;Me: no no. Go back to the video hover over it, in the bottom right hand corner of the video it should have rectangle. Click that. 

Teacher2: Ok, thanks.

&gt;Teacher2: Sonny, how do I go back to normal, not full screen?

&gt;Me: click the same button.

&gt;Teacher2: but it’s not there any more. It’s smaller now and looks different.

&gt;Me: I know, click it anyway.

&gt;Teacher2: oh yeah, thanks.


Story 3


We were doing a virtual building tour of a mosque (we were in RE (religious education))

&gt;Teacher2(yes the same person): how do I move around?

&gt;Me: click the arrows on the screen.

&gt;Teacher: *looks on keyboard for arrows. She can’t find them.* 

&gt;Me: no, on the screen. Below the picture of the mosque.

&gt;Teacher2: *clicks the arrows and we finally get on with the work.*


Story 4


I can’t remember exactly what happened but I needed to help my IT teacher with a problem she was having on Microsoft word. It was embarrassing for her.

Story 5

612,How not to check a UPS’ battery left,"Some more stories from my school’s dysfunctional IT team! This story happened some time ago, but there was a weekend where we had a big storm and had lost power. The power outage was only a brief blackout, so the UPSs should’ve been able to keep the servers and network stack online, while the servers shut down.

But we came back on the Monday of, and the servers had reports of a sudden power loss. We decided we’d go down and check the state of everything down in the server room - make sure the UPSs were connected correctly, comms cables into the server were good, and the actual battery status of the UPSs. Checking the batteries was the first thing we decided to do, and on the UPSs was a big button and a small button.

I was down there checking things out with my colleague, who was the one squeezed inside the server room actually doing things. He’s like “so which button do I press?”

“We just want to check status, so press the small one”
The big one was labelled ‘power’ and the small one was labelled ‘status’. Pretty self-explanatory.

Him: “The big one?”
Me: “No, the small on-“ 

*beeeeeeeep*

*sounds of network switches turning off*

Me: “you pressed the big one didn’t you?”

Him: “yep...”

My colleague switches off the UPS that powers the equipment for our phone systems. The server room is located in the middle of the admin building. Admin staff start coming in: “we just lost all phones, what’s going on?”

Colleague: “oh, just an unexpected outage, it’ll be fixed in a few minutes.”

After actually checking the UPS status, the batteries were only charging to 70% max, so we had them replaced.

Whenever we go down to the server room now, I ask him if he wants to have another unexpected outage.

My company launched a project recently to ""be more interactive"" and show pictures of the products being built, as sort of a visual guide. Workers scan a barcode, and the pictures show up.  Walking the shopfloor the following conversation took place:

&gt;**Me:** hey, so how's everything?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Worker:** everything's ok... but hey since you're here (they motion to the new system)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** looks fine, what's the problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Worker:** the pictures are nice, but the old system was better...  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Worker:** we're having to keep count with pen and paper for chrissakes, and it doesn't tell us what materials to use, it's slowing us down.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** wait, you had a different system before?  I'm pretty sure this is the first version of the system that we launch. Did it look similar to this?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Worker:** oh no. It looked different. Access-something...

Now, if you work with integrated systems, hearing ""Access"" can make the hairs of your neck stand up. It usually means someone developed their own database-of-things, with no integration to our other systems, no plan on who would maintain it, and stored locally... yeah

&gt;**Me:** ok, that sounds bad. Do you know if anyone made a backup?

&gt;**Me:** hey, so we're ready to implement this new system. Could you guys purchase some tablets and tablet stands?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tech:** no need. There's an old PC in here. We'll just wipe it and install this.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ok, sounds good.

My heart sunk with the realization of what had happened:  someone had developed an Access database, when products were scanned, it would keep count and show what packaging materials to use. Later, someone toured the area, saw the dusty PC and said ""there, we'll install the new system right there""...

Later, upstairs...

&gt;**Me:** hey, I remember there was this guy downstairs... handy with computers... do you know where he is? was he moved to another building?

&gt;**Admin:** yeah, he was a good guy, too bad he's no longer with the company.

The user states they don't like working with Coworker because he has no patience (after helping this User, I had none either).

So I start trouble shooting. How is the 1st monitor connected? How is the 2nd monitor connected? What cables are they using? What type of computer are you using? What is the model of the monitor?

A little background, my company got bought out two years ago and has been transitioning from HP to Dell computers. The HP Computers are EliteDesk 800 (G1 and G2), with two DP ports and a VGA port. They would be hooked up either VGA and DP or dual DP. We would also sometimes use VGA to DP adapters. The new computers are Dell 7040s, and they have two DP ports and one HDMI port.

It takes me 15 minutes to remote into the computer due to one issue or another and see that, yes, it only sees one monitor. No, it can't detect the 2nd monitor. 

So I ask User, what cables are plugged into the monitor that is not working. User replies there are three cables: Power, a VGA to DP Adapter cable, and a miscellaneous one. Cool, some of the monitors have USB ports on the side, the third cable is probably a Type B cable to make those work. 

I tell User to unplug all the cables from the monitor that is not working, and then tell her to hook up the VGA. Still not working. I ask and receive confirmation multiple times that the cable is plugged into the computer, and that they are the only two cables plugged into the monitor.


This goes on for about fifteen minutes. Then the SO of the User gets on the line. After another ten minutes of having SO unplug everything, they ask me what they should do with the VGA end of the adapter cable.

What?


Apparently, Coworker had sent User a DP cable so they can use dual monitors. User used the DP cable on Monitor 1, then used the old VGA cable to connect Monitor 1 to Monitor 2, then connected the DP Adapter to Monitor 2. However, there was no associated VGA port on the new Desktop, so it was just left dangling.  Every time I told them to plug in the Adapter, they had plugged it into the monitor, not the desktop. Every time I told them to plug in the VGA cable, it was the cable connecting Monitor 1 to Monitor 2.

Using very simple language, I had them disconnect all VGA cables. Then, had them plug the DP end of the cable into the Desktop and the VGA end into the 2nd monitor. 


Voila, it worked. 

Told User to just ignore the extra VGA cable, disconnected and closed the ticket. Looked at the phone: the call took 45 minutes and 23 seconds. 

Worst part is, this is the fourth or fifth ticket in the past few months that dealt with Work at Home user trying to setup dual monitors by connecting one monitor to the other. I've even had users plug both the VGA end and the DP Adapter end into the same monitor, and wonder why it doesn't work.

**TLDR**: No, you can't use a VGA cable to bridge two monitors to get dual monitors.",False,222,26,GunKatas1,talesfromtechsupport
615,"RAM is an abbreviation, not a command...","This happened at the beginning of my career when I was doing an internship in a PC building and support shop around 13 years ago.

Usually, the way it worked at the shop was, a customer comes in, tells us what he needs and then we would order the components, build the PC and hand it off to the customer. Occasionally though, we also had customers which took the matter into their own hands so we just ordered the components and sold them separately to the customer so he can build it himself.

In came a guy we sold some hardware 2-3 days ago and complains that he inserted everything and plugged everything in but the PC doesn't boot up. We tell him we're going to look at it and if we find something we'll call him and give him a quote. Sure enough, he left and we went to investigate.

After having plugged everything in, we try to power on the machine. Nothing. Our first guess was that he forgot to attach the power pins of the case or the PSU wasn't properly wired up. While the wiring looked a little bit wild, it seemed to be properly connected so that was a dead end.

While looking through the wiring, something else caught my eyes though. There were dents on the RAM sticks edge. 'lo and behold, it seems like the customer had trouble getting the RAM sticks in so he used a hammer to make it fit. 

You know the little notch RAM sticks usually have so you can only insert them one way? Well, apparently the customer didn't and he made it fit the other way around and in that process, broke his mainboard too.

In the end we ordered a new mainboard and 2 new RAM sticks for the customer and installed it for him. He was more than happy to have it working finally. Still baffled though how you can manage to wire up a full PC and then be dumb af when it comes to the easy part.

TL;DR: Customer was wondering why his PC didn't boot when he inserted his RAM the wrong way with a hammer.",False,3720,280,SargoDarya,talesfromtechsupport

Anyway..

So, a couple of years ago I worked for an authorized service provider where we handled a certain brand of expensive computers, tablets, phones, music devices and original accessories. Brand is not important. We primarily handled warranty, out of warranty (OOW) and claim cases sent from a big retailer, called BR, where I'm from.

A colleague of mine, called 'M' got this small laptop in for a repair, which the retailer had sent in, because the customer had returned it claiming it wouldn't power on.

So M confirmed the issue, and like with all repairs he verified serial numbers on the BR invoice, BR repair order and our repair order. Everything checks out. Next step is to find out what's causing the issue, and make sure there is no physical damage, including damage done by liquids. He opens up the unit, and finds no liquids or damages, he however finds a several years old battery, power and input/output board, motherboard and SSD. Several screws are missing, as these old parts does not fit this new model.

Everyone is surprised, as something like this has never happened before - and we've seen some odd and disgusting stuff..

So, policy is to document everything with pictures, logging everything with description of the condition of the unit. Next is to contact BR, to inform them of the situation. They don't understand, as they rarely do, and ask us how this has happened. M explains that he does not know, we can only inform them that this is how the unit was delivered to us. But it's pretty clear, that the customer has taking BR for a ride and screwing them over. 

Now what details happened next on BR's side of things are unknown, but we was informed to return the laptop to the store, and that they would take legal action towards the customer, for defrauding BR.

617,BEST DAY so far at my office!!!!,"So I work at a small MSP supporting around 100+ different clients. This story takes place in my office with a coworker. 


CW = Coworker


Me = well me


Now, CW went to a client 2 buildings down to set up the voicemail recordings for a VoIP install we just did. One of the employees had an old iPod that looked like an Iphone 4. She wanted us to destroy it.


Now, CW walked back to our office and (he told us this after the incident occurred) was excited to see the screen cracked the device to have a nice big hole in it. (We use a hydraulic press to put a 3 inch hole in our HDD's we destroy and recycle).


So, CW puts the iPod on the crusher and starts pumping away at it and (We viewed this on cameras after it occurred) was excited to see the screen cracked and get all messed up. Now what CW didn't think about was the battery...... you can see where this is going. 

Now our office has 2 sides, 1 side of the office is where 4 of us sit and handle the MSP side. The other side is where 1 tech sits and he handles residential repairs and small business support. This is where the crusher is.

CW continues crushing until the battery was punctured. Smoke starts filling the office and a small fire occurs, CW and the tech on that side rush to get the iPod out of the cursher and put outside. The whole office was filled with the nasty stench that I cannot describe. It took about 4 hours to clear out the smell. Luckily there is a door between both sides of the office that we closed and it helped.

Watching his face go from utter delight to complete OH SHIT was hilarious on the cameras. Once the instance was all said and done:

618,Just gonna throw out this perfectly good SSD,"Repair shop tech here.

Had a customer come in with a Win7 era Dell Optiplex with a pentium chip in it. Their church had replaced their computers, and they wanted it formatted and set up for reuse.

From the getgo, I set the expectation that this thing wouldn’t run all that great and that it may make more sense to just buy a new computer - they asserted that they wanted this one set up for their blind sibling whose braille keyboard compatibility stops at Windows 7. They’re upgrading from an i386.

So, we get it checked in and proceed to run diagnostics on all the main components. The hard disk had extensive sector damage, but the system also had a Samsung 860 evo 500GB SSD that seemed like it had barely been used at all, and was in perfect operating condition. Memory and processor both checked out fine.

The customer approves for us to go ahead and proceed with the work, reinstalling Windows 7. We get it all set up, along with drivers and updates. Once the integrated graphics drivers were in place, we noticed that, every now and then, the system would rapidly cycle back and forth between 800x600 and the resolution of the monitor we were using. This would go on for about 15 minutes, then  stop for seemingly no reason. After a good deal of troubleshooting and testing out different driver versions, we found the only workaround was to install a dedicated GPU.

I call them up, explain the situation, and recommend that we get a basic graphics adapter installed - before I can even quote the part, they go on a tirade about how this computer worked perfectly before, that it must be our monitor, and they have no interest in dropping another dime into this computer.

After explaining that we have tried other monitors and that no other systems exhibit these symptoms on the same monitor, they tell me they can just use a dongle to force the resolution. I said that I wasn’t aware of the existence of such a dongle, and they laughed at me over the phone saying they’d been in the industry for years and know what they are talking about.

I tell them it’s their choice, and that we pretty much have things ready to go save for this one problem that sticks its head out every now and then.

Suddenly, they have a change of heart - they accuse us of breaking their computer and say that they would not be paying for the work (we collected a deposit upfront. I was also ready to offer an older used radeon card at goodwill prices until the condescending attitude and baseless accusations came out)

I politely inform them that, as they had approved the labor charges in writing, payment will be due in order for the equipment to be returned.

They decided they wanted to take the weekend to think about things, then dropped by unexpectedly to pay for the work and pick up the system. We showed them the work we had performed, and during that time the resolution issue didn’t reproduce itself.

A day later, I got an email that they felt they had wasted their money and had dropped the computer off at a recyclery.

problem is a) the day to day emails kept piling up, and as we were hellbent on meeting the deadline, we ignored the emails that weren't shouting at us and b)i cut corners when putting them into place by not transferring over documents/favourites etc, reasoning that icould transfer them over after the deadline.

so after this project ended and the next one began (we had about a week), we proceeded to address the ignored emails. we did pretty well, as we were still in high speed mode, and managed to deal with them quickly. we told people that stuff was not transferred over, and to let us know if they had anything they wanted from their old pc. several people emailed. i took note. including an email from jean, our antagonist.

unfortunately the next project needed to be dealt with - setting up of 7 laptops for 14 work experience peoples over two weeks. we put the emails aside again and began preparing.

Today, I got a call from one of the sites I have a love hate relationship with. Like, they are lovely people, wonderful to talk to, just not the brightest.

Anyways, client calls to tell me they can't login to a portal hosted at their main site (site to site VPN) because the server is down. I'm a little baffled because the other site has around 30 seats and no one has called yet. Not to mention, this staff member knows the servers are down and my team doesn't. So I suss it out. Sure enough, the entire site hosting the servers is down.

So, needless to say, ticket becomes critical. I call the other site:

Me: Hey, uh... Your internet isn't working is it?

Reception: Nope, it has been down all morning.

Me: Uh, okay, can you put me through to soandso?

...

*Hi, you've reached the voicemail of... *

*hang up *

Me: Hey, soandso! Just wanted to find out what was happening with the internet.

Soandso: oh, the phones were kind of crackly when I came in this morning so I restarted every device in the server room except the server.

**die a little inside**

Me: Did one of my colleagues tell you to do that? 

Soandso: uh, no

**obviously**

Me: Okay, so you just reatarted a bunch of things hoping one was the router? 

Soandso: Yes... 

**For the love of god, why?! Don't touch the things. Never touch the things! **

Me: Okay, so next time, please give us a call, some of those devices should never be restarted unless there is a really good reason. 

**No, seriously, if you do that again I'll drop a UPS on your car from the roof of the building**

Soandso: no worries. While I have got you, the shared drives have been kind of slow and they have red crosses on them. Also, my Emails say trying to connect! 

**Seriously? No one can do anything and you want to have a chat about this now?! **

Me: That's because you restarted a core switch. Look, I need to give your ISP a call and let them know what you have done so they can rectify this. I'll give you a call back. 

Soandso: okay, b*hang up on her*

Call the ISP and explain everything and they work their magic.

Get the NTU and router restarted by a staff member and check the VPN is working again. 

I called back the original user with the issue and explained that everything was working again. They asked why everything was down so I told them. They then told me that soandso had called them to tell them the server was down and not to call us because it would be working again soon. 

Before closing the ticket, I added their boss as a ticket contact so he would get a transcript of the stupidity. All said and done, there was 4 hours where no one could get any work done. 40 seats across all sites, times four hours, times average pay rate of 30 per hour - $4800 lost in wages alone that morning.

623,Replacing your LCD Screen Would Not Have Deactivated Your MS Office,"*TL:DR at the bottom for anyone who does not want to read through this*

# PREFACE:

This happened over a year ago at a computer repair company I used to work at. I was one of six technicians at this small local repair shop. We sold laptops and desktops with lifetime labor attached to them\- this is important to know as this particular customer bought a laptop from us\- thus they became part of this ""lifetime labor"" warranty family.

# THE STORY:

At the time, we had three locations at this company. I was working at Location B, the main branch will be Location A. Well a customer brought in a laptop he purchased from us to my location, he was a teenager, I would guess 16 at the time. He told me everything on his screen appeared to be ""inverted"" and at that time as well, Windows 10 was released for the public to download and upgrade for free.

I take a look at the customer's laptop and ensure it wasn't the setting where everything appears inverted... sure enough, it was his LCD going bad as the invert was turned off in Windows, not to mention even in the BIOS\- it was only white screen where on a normal monitor the laptop was plugged into, it would display just fine. So I tell the customer to drop his computer off with me, I needed to pull the model and revision number of the LCD screen from the laptop and I'd call him with a price once I figured it out.

&gt;*$Customer:* Isn't this suppose to be lifetime warranty though?  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Me Thinking: Oh boy\- I'm about to have one of THOSE conversations* (There always seemed to be a convenient line of miscommunication when people break their stuff, and then mention lifetime warranties which obviously, is a shit business model that any sound person would agree with\- but we do deal with customers after all!).  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Me:* Well the labor side of it will be free, you will just pay the cost of the screen and that is it, installation is free though!  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Customer:* Oh alright. Well in your database that is my number, but you'll want to call my mom for the repair quote.

The customer then leaves after giving me his mom's contact info. I proceed to pull the screen apart and grab the info needed, head on over to where we normally buy laptop parts at, and give them a quote within the hour. I let them know that everything was ready to pick up as well if they wanted to use the laptop in the mean time while waiting for the screen to come in. They were fine leaving it, and it remained in my location until the screen arrived the next week. Keep in mind I did not mess with the machine after grabbing the LCD model number during that time period, nor did I ask the customer for his password to his computer\- which was also an online account (I realize there are ways around that, but considering it would have taken me more time and effort to bypass that over just calling and asking for the password, I just didn't bother) they wanted a screen repaired and nothing more? They got that, it was free labor either way.

Fast forward a week. The screen arrives, I replace the screen and they go home happy. That night, I was called by another fellow employee to see if I'd be willing to swap places with them for tomorrow with Location A. Location A is a lot more busier than Location B\- to the point where I was the only employee in Location B actually, where A had three employees. I was also asked to swap for the day because I work faster and more efficiently than the other technicians\- I could get a lot of tech work done vs the other employees, so I agreed to it.

The next day I go into Location A where the other employee went to location B. All is well until I get a phone call from the employee I swapped with in the middle of the work day...

&gt;*$Employee:* Hey $Me, did you do anything with $Customer's laptop aside from replacing the LCD screen?  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Me:* nope, it was an online account with a password I didn't have nor ask for, I didn't do anything else aside from replacing the screen.  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Employee:* Well... they said we deactivated their Microsoft Office and they want it back.  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Me:* A LCD screen repair would not have deactivated their office. Also, we have had a few cases this week where Microsoft deactivated MS Office 2013 on some machines. I think it's due to an update or bug but they aren't the only ones with that issue is what I am getting at. Just tell them to sign back in with their email address and if it was previously linked, they won't have any issues\- otherwise, we have no way of pulling that product key\- hopefully they still have their product key lying around somewhere at their home, but past that\- nothing I have done or can do about it now.

At the time, we didn't know of any programs that pulled Office 2013 keys. Sure we could do 2010 and prior, but anything newer and we were screwed. My coworker told me he handled it, but I guess she (Customer's mom remember!) was yelling at him for a good several minutes before finally disconnecting the phone before he could get another word in.

We then get a phone call at Location A. I mentioned Location A was the main ""branch"" right? Well if I didn't, you know now! Regardless, this is where the ""general manager"" was at. I use quotations on that because his title wasn't official as the CEO of the company didn't want to promote the guy, but relied on him to do EV\-ER\-Y\-THING for the business. But turned out, the Customer called and wanted to speak with either the owner of the company or someone ""high up"".

&gt;*$GM(General Manager):* **Company name**, this is $GM.  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Customer:* You guys deactivated my son's Office! He can't do any school work now! The computer was fine before your tech touched it! **\*Insert more ranting here\- you know, typical pissed\-off\-customer\-ranting\***.  
&gt;  
&gt;*$GM:* Well a screen repair wouldn't have done that. And the laptop was locked, my tech didn't call or ask for a password, there is no way a screen repair would have caused this.  
&gt;  
&gt;*$Customer:* That makes no sense! Office was working before he brought the computer into your company! Now it doesn't even work! We expect a free copy of Office or for it to be re\-activated and put back on!

GM basically tells them that they need the product key or to try signing in with an email account ^((Since 2013 it was not required to sign in, this was a 50/50 chance that this would work).) But there is no logical reason I was responsible for that, not to mention the previous cases we had of deactivated 2013 Offices that week which was fixed by simply signing in again or putting in your product key again. Plus he was not the type of manager to give entitled or angry customers free stuff away, so he basically told them where to go shove it, and left it at that. She was likely lashing out because they probably did not have the product key on hand, threw it away, etc\- realized they couldn't reactivate\- so tried to get another copy for free.

# The Outcome:

The customer ended up posting a google review on all three of our locations, rating us one star and mentioning the repair and how we ""deactivated"" her son's office and how he can't do school work now without spending $170 on a new copy of Office, and etc... typical petty review stuff. She also posted on Yelp and Facebook about our company with the same copy/paste review. She called demanding to speak to the owner of the company\- who was never in anyway\- seeing if he would make things right, and finally gave up after several days of not being able to reach him (The dude legit, never was at any of our locations. We employees have a hard enough time getting a hold of him and we were there 9 hours a day!). She also wrote an email to each of our publicly listed email addresses (Example: [GrowingTech@CompanyName.com](mailto:GrowingTech@CompanyName.com)) saying how terrible our service was, how she will never buy anything from us again, nor go into our locations ever again, expecting that we make this right, etc..

624,I forgot my password,"Ok. A little backstory.

I work at a place for 700+ people and i fell like i live the life of tech support comedy. Anyway. A comes to my office and tells me he forgot his password. Lets call him $Bob and I am $Me

So he walks in and the conversation goes like this:

$Bob : Hey, i forgot my password,  can you change it for me?

$Me : Okay, no problem. What is your user name? 

$Bob : It is Username123

I find his account on the server and change the password.

$Me : Okay here is your new password, Password123 with first upper case letter. 

He then starts to try to log in on his laptop several times, but is not able to log on. 

$Me : Did you write the first letter as upper case? 

$Bob : Yes, but it does not work with my password! I put it in as the username. 

My hand that is about to reach for a pen on my desk freezes. I feel the fabric of cosmos falling apart around me. I slowly turn to him and say. 

$Me : Password123 is your new password, not username. 

$Bob : Ah, Ok

It slowly downs on him this and by this point i am looking forward to him leavi-

$Bob : Hey, what is my username!

Holy Lord Turing grant me wisdom for this encounter. Because this guy just told me his account name 5 min ago!

How can he forget his username he just told me! I just stare at him and say

$Me : You just told me your username!

I see it dawns on him and and the light bulb turns on

$Bob : Ah, that thing. I don't know what it is.

At this I have developed a twitch in my lower left eyelid. I turn back to the surver and check his username in AD.

After finding it I lean on over the counter and literally hiss in his face the username while giving him the coldest look I have.

$Me : It isssss Ussssername123

I just got off a Skype for Business screen sharing session where, no matter what the user did, the volume bar would go back down to 0. He had a laptop hooked up to external keyboard, monitor, and mouse. I do some research while watching the user aimlessly move the volume bar up, then watch it go back down. I can see the frustration in his mouse clicks as his Yanni Live concert on Spotify was being so rudely interrupted. I had him go through the standard troubleshooting techniques of removing all peripheral devices to see if that cleared up the issue....no dice. After going through all this for about 20 minutes and finally resorting to asking him to reboot, he says...

626,The Complexities of Copypasta,"Howdy lads, never thought I'd have a reason to post here again. I worked tech support for a couple years, but have since moved to security. I work in a public library and today I've been managing an ongoing issue for about three hours.

So start of my shift, come in to check and all is clear. Nice, peaceful day, but somewhere in the back of my mind was a warning signal that I wouldn't have any rest. Almost immediately, I get approached by a staff member saying that a patron needed help with Excel. Fun times, I'm the only computer savvy one here.

I approach and offer my greeting, the patron tells me that he needs help making delivery labels for a printing company to print out onto stickers. While explaining, he's clicking the most nonsensical options on Excel to try and make the cells the way he wants, almost constantly going on with a stream of ""Oh no...oh gods...oh damn...what do I do here...""

The patron was trying to take a specific template meant for word and get it onto excel. It took a while to convince him he was on the wrong program, as I was constantly met with, ""I've been doing this for x years, I do it every year, it's this way."" Eventually, I convince him to let me borrow an example sheet he had and snuck into the back to work it out on my own. 

Needs Avery Template 5160, simple enough. Head to Avery, download the correct template, open it in word. Voila. Show this to the patron and...""No, no, no, this has to be in excel. How else will I get cells in it?"" After a time, I convince him to let me use his computer, pull it up in word with the cells already in the template, and am met with the typical disgruntled nature of someone proven wrong and knows they're wrong.

Day saved, back to security. 

Not even three minutes pass before I'm caught by him again. He needs 12 pages of this template so he can get everything he needs. Okay...so I suggest finishing a page, opening a new version of the template. No go, he has to have it all on one document. 

In my experience, it is always the biggest pain in the world to try and get an external template to actually copy into new pages in the same word document. I snuck back to my station again and spent about 20 minutes trying to work this out in a quick and easy way. Unfortunately, I couldn't, nor could google aid me. This whole time I'm being bothered that he has to get it done fast.

Now here, I will admit, I forgot about Labels. It took me a lot of searching to find the Mailings \&gt; Labels options and what do you know, Avery 5160 is in Word as an internal template. Problem solved! Except that the patron is bothered by the fact it looks slightly different and constantly tries to keep opening the external version instead. Eventually, I convince him this is exactly what he needs, show him the title, explain how to make new pages. This doesn't work so I just make the pages for him.

Finally, back to security, only an hour in!

...But that would be too easy wouldn't it. From here on out, over the course of the next hour, I was stopped for the most basic questions.

""How do I put a break here? Oh...press enter? So the space bar...no? Enter? So backspace...no? Oooh, enter.""

""How do I copy and paste?"" This one took ages. Again and again I would explain, for him to highlight the text. Again and again he would highlight it, left click, highlight it, right click outside the page entirely, highlight it, open menu, click out of the box. Finally, we got copying down, only for him to be more confused by paste.

I genuinely believe someone could solve Einstein's Field Equations more easily than this man could work out copy/paste. The most complicated philosophical question poses less intellectual work than copy/paste. 

Eventually, he kind of somewhat gets it. But it does not end. Every single time he has to change to a new label, usually just meaning he has to change the very last line, he has to come and ask about copy/paste again. I showed him the menu, I showed him keyboard shortcuts, I tried everything over the past two hours to make it make sense to him. It was genuinely a relief for him to ask me how to save a document to his flash drive, as it meant not explaining more about copy/paste.

I'll not ever think poorly of an older man for not understanding computers, but even in the course of typing this out, I've been interrupted four times just about copy/paste. This may be the one tech situation to make me slam my head into the desk the most, and I've worked for Frontier before.

627,"Upgrading network drivers is easy, right?","So I used to work as a trainee at my school (kinda still do work there, not as trainee tho), we were a fairly sizeable school so had equally sized infrastructure to boot. At the time, our core infrastructure consisted of 1 server that performed core roles like AD, user storage, and main network functions (like DHCP and the internet proxy) - with 2 other servers that performed misc services and any custom programs we needed to host.

Because of the size of the school, the core server actually had dual gigabit NICs. But when the server was initially installed, no pairing configuration was set on the cards - so they weren't operating in failover, round robin, teaming. They were just two independent cards. For a long time, we just kinda let it slide because we never had any issues with network performance (if it ain't broke, don't fix it).

Eventually, it got to the point where we were starting to hit capacity on the single gigabit NIC, as the school grew. We knew the server had a second NIC installed, so we planned for some configuration changes in the last week of term.

I am **SO** glad we planned to do it then.

When we went to go down and enable teaming so we could get the full fat 2gbps, the cards' drivers were complaining saying they needed the latest drivers to enable teaming. No big deal, just download the latest drivers and update... right?

We started the driver installer. It started uninstalling the old drivers so it could install the new ones, but then it said to finish uninstalling the old drivers it needed to restart. Yeah, ok, lets restart then.

One small problem (that we didn't realise at the time).
If the network drivers are going to be uninstalled on restart, the system will have no network when it comes back online again. To login to the server, we needed the AD server as there was no local login (due to security policies). The server was the AD server though. 

So now we had no AD. No internet proxy either. Luckily, one of the other slave servers was setup as a DHCP failover, so at least the local network kept operating.

Which still wasn't much use, because with no AD no one could authenticate with any of our AD driven services (which most were). And aside from that, no one could use the internet, teachers and students couldn't access their files, printing wasn't working. Pretty much the entire network was brought down.

To try and fix the issue, we had to somehow manage to get a local account onto the machine, use said local account to refresh the network drivers, and remove the local account and login with AD again. This was way too complex for our pay levels, so the head IT guy contacted the regional tech guy (who has more clearance and experience than us to fix these things), who in turn had to contact the server manufacturer directly to be able get this custom software thingy they had to use to flash a local account without breaking any of the files on the server. We never really got told the direct process of how the solution worked, but it took them the entire last week to get the network back up.

The school had no network for an **entire week**. This is why planning ~~outages~~ changes is important.

628,The IT Blindside,"So this is a bit of an off shoot from yesterday's [They Aren't Sure What They Are Buying; Saved Ya Couple Ten Grand](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8qj1ve/they_arent_sure_what_they_are_buying_saved_ya/) in the comments. I won't try and go through any dialog just the story.

**Backstory:** About two, two and a half year back a client was interested in a video presentation and conferencing setup for their business, they would have it setup at a couple remote offices in conference rooms and they could then have company wide meetings, training, conferences both internally and externally.

\-\-

So I'm not a video engineer by any means, I work on the interconnection side of the house and because this involved some networking components as well as a possible SIP server I was involved in it from that aspect.

Customer had outlined the basics for us some of the info above, they would also be the ones purchasing the solution, however a third\-party would be paying, I'm guessing some type of grant or another. With this we setup and came up with a solution based on the Polycom cloud services as it met every requirement, we also from the hardware side put together all the components for the solution(Projectors, screens, mic/speakers, etc.). At this point I'm not sure what happened, but either way the customer didn't like the cloud and asked for a pure hardware solution.

With this in mind we put together a full on projection system connected to Polycom VBP(Video Border Proxy). They signed off on it and made the purchase. Because some of the components we don't house on site took a couple weeks to gather up and get ready for, this however it where I got involved and things went awry.

We alerted the customer everything was ready for installs. Because I don't do sales it hadn't been discussed with us about installs, so naturally we call over and talk to the PM to find out no install was quoted, they didn't seem to know why and we scheduled a conference call.

Customer proceeds to explain it wasn't part of the budget and they were just purchasing for their internal IT to configure and setup. Explaining the complications behind this and that if their IT were to call us we couldn't help them beyond  basic troubleshooting. They signed off said to deliver on x date and see friendly tech who they would alert.

So we as a company hire out delivery to someone else as we don't have the trucks, they show up on the proposed date we load everything in and set them along their way.

About threeish hours later we get a call from the delivery driver telling us they can't deliver it to the friendly tech as they hadn't ordered anything, this being just shy of about $50,000 in gear they refused the delivery. We became back involved and called the tech to find out the company hadn't bothered to tell them about getting this new system and they saw a different company name listed(this being the people paying) they couldn't accept it. At this point we told the driver to stay put and we would get it straight.

A half\-day later the driver is told to bring all the gear back to us.

Over the pursuing six or so weeks we ended up having to requote out all the config, setup, implementation and charging for re\-delivery all because no one bothered to let IT know it would be coming nor did they have all the expertise needed for setup and install. This ended up being about a $8,000 charge to them.

**TL;DR:** Company purchases a video solution and doesn't bother to relay information to IT nor find out if they have all the right people to install and configure.",False,465,84,hidesinserverroom,talesfromtechsupport

Just dealt with this. I'm on my lunch break. On mobile.

I've been dealing with one of our machines not working right all day. Calling our back office to get someone to fix it won't work because they don't want to have to pay someone to come out if there's nothing wrong with it, even though this machine is famous for breaking down, and just wants to monitor it. Trying to fight them on getting a tech dispatched has really shortened my fuse right off the bat today.

Then *she* calls. She will be BOL for bitchy old lady.

So, I'm waiting for customers to come in when the phone rings. I pick it up.

I hang up. Call comes through again and I pick it up.

Me: hello, welcome to \[store\] this is theeverymaam speaking. How can I help you?

BOL: Don't hang up on me again!

Me: I'm sorry ma'am. I did just pick up the phone but there was no answer so I hung up.

BOL: Well I was speaking to you but you were ignoring me.

Me: Like I said I couldn't hear you\-

BOL: Well I could hear you and I could hear voices in the background.

Me: Yes, I think there was something wrong with the connection then, but how can I help you? (She yelled at me multiple times throughout the entire phone call that she's still there so don't hang up, but I'll spare you)

BOL: I was just in there a little while ago and some guy helped me and told me to call a number but I can't get through.

Me: well what seems to be the problem?

BOL: I'm trying to get on the computer but I can't. It won't let me. I've tried and it won't let me get in. I put in my password and everything but its stopping me for some reason.

Me: Okay so you can get on your computer just fine but need to get onto your account?

BOL: Yes.

Me: Okay, can you give me your account number or social so I can pull you up?

She proceeds to give me her husband's social (ugh) but as long as they are linked I should be able to find her. I have her give me the last four of hers to verify who she is. Neither of them have an online account. But they have several business with us. I ask her if it's under there and she has no clue (of course because why would that be useful to know) and she just says that it's the one that has all of the accounts pull up (obviously, im not stupid) so que me searching through all of their businesses to find their online account. She tells at me because she hears voices in the background and I have to explain that my coworkers are waiting on people (which is also really annoying and happens way too often).

I find it and she has indeed been locked out. Easy fix though, as we just reset the password. Unfortunately this time it wants me to either email or text a temporary one to her, rather than set it to the last four of the ssn or tin. But, no big deal... for normal people.

Me: Okay, I need to send you the temporary password so i can email or have it texted to you.

BOL: oh, yes, thats what I have. (Proceeds to repeat the whole user id) but when I put in nnn it says wrong.

Me: Okay, so you're putting that number in the password then?

BOL: yes, its nnn.

Inner me: please don't tell me you're goddamn password lady. I'm not allowed to know.

Me: okay, I can't see your password so I don't know what it sent you. Unfortunately, at this time, I can't do anything for you. I can give you the number for online support to call.

BOL: I don't know if I have the patience to deal with them today.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but we don't have access to your online account so the only thing I can do for you is reset your password like we've already tried. Hang on one moment and I'll get you the number.

630,Why do we not have parts for what we service? Why can't I order cables? WHYYY!?,"Sup. I do, among other things, on site service for a brand of RFID security gates used by libraries, and the self check-out kiosks that go with them.

I got a call at the end of March in a rural town that was part of a very small network of libraries. They have one self check-out computer. The monitor no longer displays anything. I plug in an adjacent monitor from one of the computers there for internet browsing, and I see the output just fine. The broken monitor has a touchscreen builtin, so this monitor I grabbed for testing can't take its place, but at least I know what is going on.

I figure this will be easy. All it needs is a new monitor. How much trouble could this be? 

I ask one of my leads which monitor I'm looking to order, since this kiosk is so old I don't have any documentation on it. He gives me a number, and I order it. About 20 techs are waiting for this part, and have been for a while. After a couple of weeks of waiting, I find out he misunderstood which kiosk I'm ordering for, and that the part I ordered is a all in one PC, not just a monitor. I don't even want to try and reimage a new machine, since I just need a monitor. 

Turns out, that particular touchscreen/monitor combo doesn't have a part number in my parts order system. I have a similar one that usually goes with a different unit. So I order it. It so happens that the monitor I ordered doesn't fit on the same stand, and only takes DVI in, while the computer only outputs on VGA. After ordering the stand that goes with the new monitor we found out that the depot had a little problem where they mixed up two sizes of stand, requiring me to reorder the stand.

Ordering the adapter came with it's own challenges. Searching for DVI adapter gives me about 30 different items, with varying codes, and descriptions that are all a little more vague than I'd like. I more or less pick one at random and hope for the best. I also order a DVI cable. Someone in logistics calls me up:

&gt; $logistics: Hey, this adapter you ordered is about a couple hundred bucks. I can get another brand for a lot cheaper, would that be alright?

&gt; $me: It cost how much? Get whatever brand you want, doesn't matter to me and that price is rediculous.

And I get a call from a different logistics guy:

&gt; $otherlogisticsguy: Hey, can you order a cable coded for library calls?

&gt; $me: No, they don't have their own special part number for video cables.

&gt; $otherlogisticsguy: Well, you need to stick to parts labeled for libraries. Buy a cable at a store on your way their, add the part to the ticket, and then submit the form for reimbursement.

&gt; $me: The hell?

&gt; $otherlogisticsguy: I know, I don't make the rules.

Remember how this all started at end of March? I didn't get everything together until last Friday, so the kiosk hasn't been usable for the past two months.

I get to the library, thinking that I will finally get this call out of my queue. After putting the monitor on its stand and arranging some cabling, I turn it on and am greeted by a no video input error. Hell. Examination of the DVI to VGA adapter I ordered showed a couple of oddities. First, the DVI side is labeled input, and the VGA side is labeled output. I didn't know these came in one way varieties. Second, the adapter requires a 5V power supply. It was not supplied with a 5V power supply. Why would it need a power supply? Why is it so hard to order a simple, common PC part?

Currently my hope is that the Best Buy in the town between me and the library has an adapter that will work. I'll just buy it on my own, and put it down as a parking expense on my time sheet, since I little interest in filling out a ticket to get reimbursed in a month for a small sum.",False,265,53,RyeonToast,talesfromtechsupport

So a little back story on this, we had a client that for the past several years asked for an implementation of Sharepoint and conversion of local resources into Sharepoint. All in all this is about a 100 \- 110 hour job for the work requirements between setup, implementation, conversion, design, engineer and on\-site support. This has bounced back and forth multiple times over the years, paused, stopped, re\-quoted, etc.

This one particular day after some long and lengthy discussion on when this would be ready to begin the scope of work it went a bit sideways.

At the beginning our conversations we had gone over Office 365 and it's requirements versus an on\-prem solution requiring varying licensing, hardware and software purchases. To our surprise they went with an on\-prem solution, later we would find out that during our discussions on O365, they kept referring to the Office suite of products and didn't seem to understand the Sharepoint part of it.

Because of their business and size they were offered really aggressive pricing from us, but Microsoft had even better purchasing power, however they decided to spend a couple ten\-thousand with us from licensing, software and hardware.

Then one day this happened. We get a call saying we need another meeting, after already signing everything.

* **ME = Well Me**
* **Customer = Well Customer of course**

&gt;Customer \- So we need to talk about the Sharepoint pricing and why you are charging x ten\-thousand dollars for software and hardware  
&gt;  
&gt;Me \- We offered pricing on the base software, all needed licensing and hardware needed to run the Sharepoint instance  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer \- We are interested in other products now rather than just Sharepoint

At this point I go about explaining the on\-prem versus the Office 356 with Sharepoint options, yet again. Giving them examples of our pricing vs Microsoft. It was as this point we also learned they had not involved their IT department until after everything was decided upon. Also learning their internal IT department had explained better pricing via Microsoft vs us and seemed to not believed or maybe understood exactly what O365 with Sharepoint was.

As such I confirmed what their IT department told them and proceeded to save them oh about a couple ten\-thousand dollars in the process.

Okay then, ssh into the IP of the access server and...

What? No response? That VM should be up.

It was at this point that I realized the entire VM cluster was down. After a brief conversation with our other IT department (it’s better if you don’t ask, because that is something that I do not fully understand myself, and therefore cannot answer) they tell me that the electrician had to do some maintenance on the giant UPS, and some unknown connections were unplugged. Turns out, those unknown connections were our entire server room.

We were running an older (read; extremely outdated) version of XenServer. This cluster, which had been running for years, hadn’t been patched properly by the previous admin, and there were MANY custom modifications. There were three servers; one for development, two for production. The production servers were in a pool, with HA enabled. All three had dedicated connections to our storage server (a direct Ethernet line and private address for each server).

XenServer HA is automatic load balancing of VMs across pool members. Basically, it would migrate the VMs to a different server if one went down. Nice, and very useful. Ours was tested and working.

Or so I thought.

Now here’s some important information that you need to know about XenServer.

1. HA uses a remote storage server that is mounted on all pool members to get a ‘heartbeat’ from each server, along with the drives for each HA VM. No remote storage, no HA, no VMs.
2. Gracefully powering down a master server in a pool WHILE LEAVING ITS SLAVE ON allows a slave to take on master duties to keep the pool running. This is not true if the slave is turned on by itself.
3. The “slave” server will fail to start anything properly if it can’t reach the master when it boots, including its access console.

By this point, I had confirmed that very bad things had happened to our VM servers. Luckily, the Dev server was fine, it just hadn’t automatically powered on. That was easy. Push power button and wait.

But the production cluster was a VERY different story. The master couldn’t find the remote storage, so no HA, so no VMs. The slave was completely unusable. It didn’t even respond to pings correctly. DNS, Authentication, Access, Logging, all of it was offline.

So I start digging. Force mount the storage in XenServer; fails. Manually mount it to somewhere else; succeeds. Manually mount it on different folder in XenServer; succeeds. Add new repo with the server’s IP; succeeds. Attempt to mount in XenServer again; fails.

At this point I look at the error message and proceed to facepalm harder than Picard ever has.

“Hostname unknown; host storage.server.uni could not be found; reason: resolver timed out.”

The previous admin had added the storage server using a DNS name, when the DNS servers were VMs.

Easy fix, I think, very annoyed. Change the host name to the IP. Problem solved. Server starts properly.

Now this is easy, I think. Just use the HA pool to start all the VMs on the master until I can fix the slave.

Except HA is reporting that there are 0 VMs in the pool.

Even if the disks weren’t there I would have received some kind of error, and a broken VM would have shown up. But no, the VMs are all outside the pool. What the heck?

Fun fact: by default, XenServer creates the VM’s drive in the default storage array. The default storage array’s default location is the local disk, not HA. So guess where all the VMs’ hard drives were.

Some VMs were installed on the master. LDAP, SSH, Samba, all working. DNS?

We have six DNS servers. The two sets of two main ones use Ceph for failover on the same IP, and the others are for other networks. All are redundant, with some measure of failover.

Every single one is on the slave VM server. Which is broken.

What followed was an arduous process of replacing hostnames with IPs using a live disk to mount XenServer’s root disk and modify it manually. 

Alternately, as I found out later, hitting CTRL-ALT-F2 on the server would have dropped me to a login shell, where the process would have taken ten minutes. You win some you lose some.

With that Catch-22 averted, DNS started. DNS worked.

Turns out, for once, it wasn’t DNS. Except it was.

But why wouldn’t the VMs boot without the HA mount? Because the previous admin had created a second disk for each VM on the remote storage, and never used it.

Another fun fact; this version of XenServer would not migrate local disks across servers. So that was where the DNS servers stayed until that cluster died. Gotta love those ultra-redundant single-point-of-failure systems.

TL;DR: previous admin used hostnames to connect remote storage to VM server, which required the DNS VMs to be on, all while those VMs had been created outside of HA, instead locking them to a single server, but still required that HA disk to be mounted, which required DNS. A Catch-22 that didn’t need to exist.",False,225,21,chientaylor,talesfromtechsupport
636,Drunk guy told my husband this app was free! You charged me $30 and only the BBB can fix it!,"Good afternoon all. Our mobile app has about 7 million users and I’m on a team that handles customer inquiries. The app can be downloaded for free to use some features, but the main feature requires digital credits. Can’t say more or it will be a giveaway for the app.
This one came in direct from a web form on our company website today.

IW will be Idiot Wife. Me will be me.


IW: said this was free and you charged me $30

Me: hey IW, thanks for contacting us! We see that there is no account with the email you provided. While the mobile app is free to download from the Google Play Store, it does cost (digital currency) to use the (main feature of the) app. The charges will appear like X on the billing statement

IW: I never said I had an account!!! My husband was told at the bar that this app was free and then ya’ll charged his card $30!! My husbands name is X and I expect a refund within 24 hours! This is absolutely ridiculous!! I have been waiting for a refund for a month!!

Me: The app is free to download, but it is not free to (use main feature). This is the first message we have received from (email).
We see in the screenshot you have sent that there is a $20 and $10 purchase. The payment information was entered manually into the app and the “purchase credits” button was tapped. 
Once for a $20 package and once for a $10 package. 
There is also a screen after that which confirms the purchase. 

In order to assist, we would need to be contacted directly from the email associated with the account or the mobile app account itself. We do not have any information for the account at this time.

IW: he deleted your stupid app after ya’ll charged us $30! If I don’t have my money back in 24 hours I’m going to the BBB since you obvious can’t help and they can. Have a nice day.

Me: the app is not free to use. No representative from (company) has claimed otherwise. In order for us to locate the account, we would need the email address associated with the account. We would be able to issue a refund for (digital currency) that has not yet been used, but we could not issue a refund for currency that has already been used. 


IW: go f*** yourself the BBB will give me what I need




So looking forward to speaking with legal about this BBB claim for an account which hasn’t even been identified. The BBB cannot issue the money back, lol.

Sorry the drunk guy at the bar lied to your husband, and then your husband input the payment info manually and made 2 purchases. Did he think it was a fake receipt and fake digital wallet? The field to enter the payment info was fake, as well as the “CONFIRM PURCHASE” pop up...?
Guarantee that if we find the account all the digital currency has been used.

637,Track 9: The Great Southern Trendkill,"I've been on this sub for the past 2 years, unwilling to post as the salt is still very much with me from a previous life in IT. I have some stories. Hopefully some will find them amusing, they were not so much for me.

This happened around the 2006\-2007 era. Whenever XP SP2 was the latest and greatest. My dad owned a consulting business at the time. I was in my early teens and he took me along most afternoons to teach me computers. We had a client that was keen on keeping older equipment around. They kept their desktops on the floor in a ground\-level office building. To accessorize, they had these old CRT monitors from maybe \~1996 when they first moved in.

A hurricane pays us a visit, flooding most of the area. 1 to 3 feet of water on the roads. Every desktop in the building is submerged in at least a foot of water. Completely non\-salvageable. My dad, as the “IT guy,” gets called into the building a few days later to meet with an insurance adjuster. The office is still somewhat flooded and without power. However, management NEEDS their employees up and running as soon as possible. The adjuster meets my dad and begins taking inventory. It should be noted that many of the CRTs were fine. They were plugged into surge protectors and, oddly, didn't take any water damage. I think they lost 2 or 3.

My dad doesn't give a f\*\*\*. He told me he got caught piling some CRTs onto the still flooded office floor to make it look like they were damaged in the flood. Thing is, the adjuster puts them in as non\-salvageable anyway. Being as it is my dad telling me this story, I assume he exaggerated to keep me entertained.

Fast forward two weeks: the carpets are being professionally dried, the cubicles are almost repaired, and we have twenty\-something boxes of new PCs and monitors to go along with them. I don't know and I don't want to know. 

Epilogue: In case anyone is concerned, the office's servers were all on top of a desk in a small data closet. They were unharmed. The “only” data lost was whatever the users had saved locally. Music (when Limewire was still a thing), desktop files, pictures, documents… It was a s\*\*\*show, in as far as all the idiots using company property to download music were now without their precious Santana. The users who whinged were met with exactly the type of stare you'd expect from a man who has, for the past two weeks, been screamed at by management about getting desktops back online. They really got the hang of “saving to the server” after that. Yeah. Right.",False,94,21,worsens,talesfromtechsupport
638,MFAM Sidestories: Unattended Baggage,"*This happened about 45 minutes ago*

In the world of US Commercial Aviation, we find ourselves fully immersed in the security culture that’s become so prevalent these days.  Nobody wants to see another hijacking, another bomb, another crash, another 9/11, so we more or less accept the heightened security at work.  Of course, this security requires some additional training on the part of the police and TSA and their canine companions are just as subject to that training.

There are several variety of canine we see wandering our hangars alongside their handlers on training missions, but most common are the Drug and Bomb dogs.  I really don’t know the number of times I’ve stepped onto a plane to discover a drug dog happily snuffling away beneath our cargo holding equipment, looking for a sample of the good Columbian nose candy.  

Today was no different—a K9 team was working the parts storage area behind my current cubefarm, to which we paid little attention.  It’s a fairly secure, low-distraction environment, perfect for training a dog, so it made sense they were up here.  As a result, I didn’t even register them working among the parts racks as I walked by, headed to the restroom in the same area.  

Standing at the sink a minute later, I happened to look over at the hand-towel dispensers and I noticed two plastic ammo cans with a bag of latex gloves perched atop the dispensers.  Curious and thinking from the gloves we must have gotten some new restroom first aid kit, I grabbed one of the boxes, opened it up and glanced inside.  I was greeted by several long, olive drab blocks on which was emblazoned:

###CHARGE, DEMOLITION M112

Somewhere down low and directly behind me a black hole opened up and I could feel my entire body getting sucked into the void. I was holding in my hand a block of C4, in the wild.  

It took a moment to realize there was a “PROPERTY OF TSA” label on the packaging, and as I slowly, carefully closed the ammo box, I noticed the “SOMEWHERESVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT” label discretely affixed to the top of the box.  

I then replaced it in its home and proceeded to scrub my hands pretty hard.  Exiting the restroom, I ran into one of the officers.

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “..You guys just scared the daylights outta me.”

&gt;**Officer** “Oh?  Did you find something?”

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Yeah, you could say that.  And after I saw what was inside, I washed my hands, a lot.”

&gt;**Officer**  *laughing* “You didn’t take anything did you?”  

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Nope!  I don’t need *any* of that in my life!”

A few minutes later, exercise concluded, the K9 handler introduced us to the dog, a very friendly and beautiful German Shorthair, and we all had a laugh.  


Now, pardon me, I need to go search the void for my stomach.

639,Nothing plugs in right,"Right before I was supposed to go on lunch a young woman walked into my shop asking if we could see why she can’t use the ports on her computer. According to her whenever she plugs something in she has to do it multiple times then giggle the cord before it works and it’s become so much of a hassle she just wants to get it fixed. 

So I get called in to check out her laptop and I boot it up and try to plug a test cable into it. That’s when I felt a patch of rough and scratched metal along the side of her computer. I turn it to the side and look to see whatever that was and I’m almost horrified. 

All of the ports are scratched and bent. Like someone was trying to force a usb cable in repeatedly like they were stabbing it instead of turning it around.  Upon closer look 2/3 USB ports are actually bent out of shape. 

I walk to the front to talk with the lady and she tells me that she gets “the way the cord is supposed to be in wrong sometimes”. I ask if she is trying to force it in and she says that she sometimes does but then realizes it’s the wrong way and flips it around. 

I then ask if she has any problems when she tried to transfer files onto a usb stick and she says sometimes stuff doesn’t copy over when she thought it did. 

I’m on my lunch break right now but I can already tell this is going to take up the rest of my shift.  

Edit: I epoxied a hub to the least broken port and attached it to the case. It’s only a temporary fix but she wanted to keep the computer even after it was filled with corrupted files from her pulling the usb out while transferring data. ",False,194,35,gamageeknerd,talesfromtechsupport

It was a Saturday in early winter - cold, but clear. Snow had fallen a few days previously, but had melted away in all but the coldest and darkest corners of town.  
My children were quiet and reserved; this would have been highly unusual, if not for the mucous that frequently ran from their various facial orifices. While I sought to battle the invading Sinus Goblins, trying to prevent them from gaining a foothold that would be difficult to dislodge them from, my wife tended to the children, seemingly impervious to their attack.

So it was with a specific lack of enthusiasm that I answered the suddenly ringing on-call phone.

&gt; Dispatcher (D): Hey G.

&gt; ME: Hey D, what's up?

&gt; D: Do you look after *{site}*?

&gt; ME: No. Wait, yes. Maybe? I think I might have gone there once, about six months ago? I remember a long drive but not much else.

&gt; D: That's probably right; they're pretty far off. It looks like the site's on some weird support contract, so you probably almost never hear from them.

&gt; ME: Makes sense. What's the issue?

&gt; D: Well the Helpdesk just called me; apparently the site rang in, reporting that the screen is showing a *'system unavailable'* message.

&gt; ME: Dammit!

The system could show many messages - some good, some bad. For example, ""system not ready"" was a standard message that meant the system was still booting up (startup time is approximately 10 minutes); however, ""system unavailable"" indicated that a serious error had occurred - the sort that can only be resolved by replacing the entire system completely. The process consisted of me installing the new hardware, a remote engineer configuring it, and then me testing it prior to departing site. A competent engineer could complete the remote configuration in about half an hour; however, my personal experience was that I would have to wait anywhere between 1.5 and 4 hours... and the wait was always much longer outside regular business hours.  
Like on a Saturday. Like today.

To say that I did not want to deal with it would have been an understatement on par with calling Mt Everest ""that little incline"".

But I was on call. What I wanted was not an option.  
In the common vernacular, I was *""le sigh.""*

&gt; ME: Yeah, okay, assign and push the job to me - I'll pick up a replacement system from the depot and get on the road.

&gt; D: Um... Do you know how to do that?

To be fair, we recently switched to a new job system. Also, D just got a promotion, which means very shortly, he'll no longer be dealing with the after hours jobs.  
Fortunately, I had just spent two hours in an intensive training session with the new system, so I had a pretty good idea of what needed to be done.

&gt; ME: Yes. Maybe. I'll have a go.

&gt; D: Cool, the job number is 12345.

I quickly downed a couple of painkillers, and got to work.

After battling through the login system for the job management software, I quickly found the job. With a little educated guessing on the specifics of the process, I soon had it assigned to myself, even taking the time to send myself the required SMS notifications (because otherwise the status sits on PENDING DISPATCH; actually sending the notification changes it to DISPATCHED, allowing me to carry on with the next steps).  
Paperwork¹ completed, I quickly changed into a clean uniform, grabbed my keys and headed in to the depot. Fortunately, I have fresh systems boxed up and ready for immediate pick up for exactly this situation, so I grabbed one and ~~dropped~~ carefully placed it on the passenger seat. Then I punched in the site address to the GPS.

&gt; ETA: 1 hour 45 minutes

Well, crap. I knew my Saturday was already shot, but the realization that I won't see home again until well after dark suddenly hit home.  
I started the engine and pulled on to the road.

^(¹ ""Paperwork"" is an odd term for an activity completed entirely in the digital realm - I imagine it will one day end up much like the) ^[floppy](https://i.imgur.com/Ft7oopQ.jpg) ^(is today.)

The miles hissed away beneath the tires; except for one quick stop for road snacks, I'd been driving constantly. Snow still littered the edges of the roads - it seemed that at this altitude, it was less prone to melting. It didn't help that a large section of the drive was under repair; the roadworks had stretched for miles and miles. I guesstimated that I'd averaged at least 20% under the speed limit; this was borne out by arriving almost half an hour after the original estimated arrival time.  
But finally - at long, long last - I pulled in to the site.

It was deserted.  
This is not unusual - the system itself is mostly autonomous, with most usage occurring in either late at night or early in the morning.

I checked the screen.

There was no error message.

All systems appeared to working correctly. I grabbed my test equipment from the van and carried out a full system test.  
It passed on the first try.  
No errors.

I picked up the phone.

&gt; ME: Hey D!

&gt; D: Hey G, are you at site yet? What did you find?

&gt; ME: Yes, I just arrived. And as for what I found... I've got nothing. It's all working perfectly.

&gt; D: Well, damn - that's weird!

&gt; ME: I know - 'system unavailable' is usually a complete replacement, right?

&gt; D: It is in my experience!

&gt; ME: Okay, well... I guess I'll just close the job then, and drive another couple of hours to get home then.

&gt; D: Yeah... I mean, there's not much else you can do... Did you...?

&gt; ME: Yep.

&gt; D: Oh, and did you check...?

&gt; ME: Sure did.

&gt; D: Huh. Well, if all that's clear, then I guess there's nothing for it, except to close the job.

&gt; ME: Okay, I'll do that now.

Then I saw something.

&gt; ME: D, I'm going to break my cardinal rule here, and curse loudly on a customer's site. It's OK; this place is abandoned.

&gt; D: What? Why? Huh?

&gt; ME: ***[7DW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words)!!!***

&gt; D: What's going on?

&gt; ME: Check the job notes.

&gt; D: What? Okay... oh, ***[7DW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words)!!!***

&gt; ME: That's what I said!

In the job notes, the third sentence read:

*Screen shows error message* **'system not ready'.**

&gt; D: I'm sorry, G; Helpdesk told me it was 'system unavailable' and I never thought to check what he'd actually written down in the job notes - I assumed he knew that UNAVAILABLE is different and distinct from NOT READY.

&gt; ME: Well... sh!t happens. I guess the system reset for some reason, someone tried to use it while it was starting up, got the NOT READY error and reported it to Helpdesk, who recorded it correctly in the notes but passed it on incorrectly during the verbal escalation.

&gt; D: Yeah, sounds about right.

&gt; ME: So... it was probably working correctly again by the time I had finished assigning the job to myself in the system.

&gt; D: That message never sticks around for more than 15 minutes; you're probably right.

&gt; ME: Well... I'm going to go home now. I'll let management figure out what to do with this job on Monday, because I figure I'm going to be pushing five hours² of time and a half, for a job that I didn't actually need to attend, for a customer who gets billed time and materials.

&gt; D: Yeah, this is going to suck.

D is located in the same office as the managers that are going to have to deal with this.

&gt; ME: Better you than me, bud.

With that, I disconnected the call, started the engine, and got on the road once more.

I had a think. She needs two mouses [yes, I know, the plural should me ""mice"" - but a long time ago a certain bunch of 'Murikans deemed that it is ""mouses"" when referring to more than one computer mouse], and she needs the one under her right-hand to be ""right-handed"" and the one under her left-hand to be ""left-handed"". It would also help if the right-handed mouse was lighter than a normal mouse.

643,Getting schooled by my 78 year-old Gran,"Hi TFTS, unqualified 'family tech-support' here. As oldest of the grandchildren, it has become my reluctant task to help my family with all problems relating to The Google, The Internet Button (ie, IE), and Have You Tried Turning It Off And On Again. This includes increasingly senile Grandma, whom I am visiting for a fortnight to prepare her for a move to hospice in the near future.

Old Gran isn't doing so well after having a couple of strokes. In terms of tech support, she is terrified by anything more complicated than a washing machine, to the point that when her TV showed her an unexpected message last night she turned it off in a panic and had to sit down and take some deep breaths before shakily turning it on again. What she had done was press the 'TV Guide' button. My mum had tried buying her what she thought would be a user-friendly tablet, but Gran was unable to do the quick taps required to push the buttons on the touchscreen, she could only press and hold. All this combined with her general confusion with life has made for a difficult fortnight.

All that said, she still manages to be sweet at times, and  the other day she bought a CD of what she hoped was some good pop music that my generation liked. This CD turned out to be Cliff Richards, which is not my style, but I was touched that she was thinking of me so I fired up the CD player. This is an ancient beast which used to be part gramophone, at least 30 years old. She hadn't touched it since her husband died, but after a dust off and a plug in, it fired up nicely. 

There was one problem though - the CD drawer wouldn't open. There was a big round button that said open/close, and I jabbed away at it, but it wouldn't budge. I tried pressing it from the front, from the side at every angle, even wiggling it in case a wire had come loose, trying to find the magic touch for 15 minutes, but nothing worked. I told Gran that it was busted and prepared to switch it off again, when she suddenly overcame her fear and gave it a poke herself. 

...and it worked. You see, I was using the quick taps that most buttons and touchscreens these days needed, but dear old Gran was pressing slowly and holding, and that's just what the old machine wanted! Sometimes an old machine needs an old touch",False,882,24,U_RACK_DISIPRINE,talesfromtechsupport

Sure enough, it was $IPG but he sounded... different. There was something seriously wrong with his server and for once he was worried and didn't sound like he wanted to pick a fight. I took a deep breath and steeled myself for the callback.

&gt; $IPG: Thanks for calling [Product Store], how can I help you?
&gt;
&gt; $ESF: *(doing my best to be sympathetic and polite)* Hi $IPG, it's $ESF. I got your message, what's up?
&gt;
&gt; $IPG: Oh man, I don't know what's going on, my computer keeps crashing and there's a bunch of junk on the screen!
&gt;
&gt;$ESF: Don't worry, we can figure this out. Can you go into the office and read to me exactly what it says?

I'm put on hold while he moves to the back office where the server is. It's a kernel panic and once he reads enough of it, I know *exactly* what's happening. Here's the short version of what ensued:

&gt; $ESF: Okay, I think I know what's going on. You have a network cable with both ends plugged into the switch.
&gt;
&gt; $IPG: No way, that's not possible!
&gt;
&gt; $ESF: Look, I need you to humor me here...

First I have him locate the cable that goes from the switch to the server, have him unplug it from the switch, then restart the server. Then I ask him to plug the cable back in. Sure enough, it bombs immediately.

&gt; $ESF: Yep. Unplug it again and leave it unplugged for now.

I then walk him through tracing each cable that should go from the switch to the patch panel on the wall. Each one checks out until...

&gt; $IPG: This one connects back to the switch!
&gt; 
&gt; $ESF: Yeah, unplug it.

I explain the extra cable and why it's there. I try to explain why plugging both ends into the switch is a really bad thing and what packet storms are, but that doesn't get very far.

&gt; $ESF: Go ahead and reboot the server then plug it back into the switch and make sure everything is working again.
&gt;
&gt; $IPG: *(after a bit of puttering around)* Yeah man, everything's working again! That's awesome, I thought my system was destroyed! *(continues muttering about how his brother who sometimes works in the store probably screwed it up)*
&gt;
&gt; $ESF: It's all good. One last thing though. I'd suggest you take that spare cable and put it in your desk draw to keep it safe for some time when you might actually need it. Have a good day.",False,426,37,ExtraStrengthFukitol,talesfromtechsupport
645,"Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew...","Real short post.  I just read a recent post about troubleshooting a variable name, and it reminded me about something that happened to me about two years ago.... 

I'm not a programmer. I'm not some script god, but with the help of the Googelers and some time, I've created a number powerahell and batch scripts to quickly run repetitive or otherwise time consuming tasks. 

Unbeknownst to me, a couple of my scripts had made their way into the hands of our LAN admin team. I found this out one day when I happened to see a familiar line roll by as I was troubleshooting a hanging issue in one of the server login scripts. I found that they had reused my script because it solved an issue they were having and now it runs on nearly 20,000 devices daily.... Anyway.... 

One day I get an IM from the DBA manager. He'd discovered one of my powershell scripts and wanted to ask me about it. 

The issue in question? 

Why did I have a variable that stores the search pattern to run the script against, called $whatstatersprecious?

No. I did not have to ask him what script he was talking about. ",False,298,23,Slightlyevolved,talesfromtechsupport
646,Computer won't turn on? Brick it by installing a new HDD!,"Hello y'all! FTP, LTL, you know whats up.

I've been reading this sub for quite some time now but never really had a story to share.Now that I entered an internposition at a medium sized company in my city, specialized in OCR and corresponding software, I am finaly part of this mysterious and magical IT\-world and hope I can share some fun stories in the future.So far I am thrilled to be part of it. This may be subject to future change.

Anyway, I have my first story to share. Albeit from family techsupport.

$me \- BeardedIntern$bro \- my brother

I got messaged by $bro that his computer died without warning and wouldn't turn on again. Urgency Level: Doomsday!As his favorite (and only) IT\-Wizard, maybe I was willing to help him out? Of course I was. But before I hop on my bike and take the half hour tour to our mothers home where he currently lives, I asked him a few questions. Maybe I could spare the trip and solve the riddle from my couch.The questions where as follows:

* What did you do when it stopped working?
* Did you smell anything funny when it happend?
* Did you hear anything funny when it happend?
* Do your other devices in your room still have power?
* If you try to turn it on, does anything inside the case moves, blinks or gives a sound?
* Is the light on your monitor on?

I was confident that I coverd all the important parts. \[Spoiler: I didn't.\] He did nothing special, browsing some internets. didn't smelled or heared anything. It just shut off, no sound, no pop\-upp, nothing. Everything else got power, the light on the monitor is happily glowing.Welp, off I go.

\- about 30 minutes later \-

I sit infront of his, now working, computer.

&gt;$me: Did you tried what I just did?$bro: Uhm. Actually, no.$me: I see. Next time, unplug the powercord, wait a minute or \&gt;two, plug it back in and try to turn it on again.$bro: Ok, sorry 'bout that.$me: It's allright. Could've asked you if you tried it. Guess I'm \&gt;riding home again.

I got up and was ready to leave when my brother showed my the new harddrive he bought, after asking for my advices on the subject. I offerd to install it for him.

\- about 10 minutes of tinkering with cable management and such \-

$me: I hate windwos.$bro (surfing on his smartphone): What? Why?

I point at his monitor. ""Please select a proper boot device.""

$bro: Oh...$me: Yep. Maybe...

I unplug his SSD from which the computer tried to boot, which has no OS installed on it, and tried again. Same prompt. Unplug the new HDD, only running his old HDD at this point.  Lo and behold! I got to the repair screen. That's something different, so it's progress. I don't like it very much, though. Shut down, plug the SSD back in, just to see what it will bring. Exactly nothing. Very well. I bricked it for the time being. I apologised, cursed $MS for being a twat about the new HDD and rode home.

That was yesterday. Today I gave him a bootable USB\-Stick to start the repair in the hopes that that will fix the problem quickly. (I doubt it, to be fair.)

Will come back with an update, advices are welcome. If I borked the formatting I will come back to adjust as best as I can. And as a last point, I am not a native speaker, so there might be some errors I overlooked. Correct me where necessary.

EDIT: Today I went back to fix the mess. Asked a friend for some magical IT\-Dust and got going. I wanted to start at point zero, just to see where I could go from there. The HDD with the OS into the first SATA socket. The SSD into the second. The new HDD into the third. Went into the UEFI to arrange the order of the boot devices. Also checked, that the MB recognized the drives. It did, I set the OS\-HDD as first, then removable device and as third the optical dirve. Continued the boot process. Worked. Set a letter for the new drive, named it. Everything works as it should. I don't really know why it didn't before, but now it does. And that's enough for the time being. I read all your comments and use them to learn. About the tech and how I will post in the future. Thanks folks!",False,100,51,BeardedIntern,talesfromtechsupport
647,The One-Year Print Job,"LTL, FTP, etc.

Dialogue rewritten because I can't remember the details. Both it and the regular text is probably poorly written.

At $company, we're in the process of reorganizing our Azure tenant so that it makes at least some sense. Right now it's a mess. As part of this, I've been monitoring network traffic so we can set up proper vnets and firewall rules. I was going over the packet capture from $legacyApplication, when I saw something very odd: SNMP and raw print traffic to an IP address well outside of our private network.

&gt; **$me**: Hey, $manager, come look at this. The $legacyApplication server is talking to this IP address [*indicates $randomIP with mouse*], which is registered to the DoD Network Information Center. In Ohio.

&gt; **$manager**: What? That's bizarre. I can't think of any reason it should be doing that...

&gt; **$me**: Well, yeah, neither can I. I'll keep looking.

I took a deeper look at the packet logs and saw that the $legacyApplication server was making thousands upon thousands of SNMP requests to this random, apparently DoD, IP address. For the moment, I set up firewall rules to block the traffic just in case it was malicious.

I paused in my analysis of that for a while to look at some other traffic, but when I came back I looked up ""Windows making random SNMP requests"" and found a forum post where someone mentioned Print Spooler. I RDCed into the $legacyApplication server and checked the printers, and voila, a network printer was set up at $randomIP with SNMP enabled. I opened the print spooler to find a single print job, one page long, submitted by $manager on 2017-04-04.

I went and found $manager again.

&gt; **$me**: So I figured it out. [*frantically trying to log on in time for a dramatic reveal*]

&gt; **$manager**: What was it?

&gt; *$me*: Print Spooler.

&gt; **$manager**: Print Spooler? I still think it's $legacyApplication trying to print-

&gt; **$me**: [*finally finishing logon*] It's right here in this printer's properties... ports... there. [*indicates $randomIP in port properties*] And in the print queue... The culprit is you.

&gt; **$manager**: The culprit is me. Wait, 2017-04-04? That's... old.

&gt; **$me**: Yeah, um. It's been trying to print this same document to a non-existent printer at someone else's IP address for over a year. Well, not really ""print to,"" more like ""print at."" I think we can ""stand down yellow alert"" on this one.

It turns out that $manager was trying to set up printing via RDC on the $legacyApplication server for the users a while back, which is where the print job came from.

So that's the tale of how a test print job from over a year ago sat in the print queue of a non-existent printer on a cloud server caused a brief security panic and possibly flooded some random server with SNMP requests.

648,Human Resources and It's Over 9000! Baby Pictures,"Over the past decade of IT Help Desk/Administrator, I dealt with my share of odd IT requests and situations. These days, I work with a tight\-knit group that provides level 1 tech support to various companies in various industries. Boy, this was a fun one from the Human Resources manager of one particular company a couple of days ago.

So, it was a typical Wednesday morning at first, I was drinking my coffee with a pair of double chocolate muffin tops. Enjoying the calm before the storm and then the Help Desk phone rang from the manager of Human Resources herself. The HR director developed a reputation of a micromanager with a swift mood swing. So, I braced myself and answered the phone.

&gt;$NYFranc: Good Morning, this is Help Desk, $NYFranc speaking.  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: Help Desk?! Thank god, I need help. It's Over 9000!  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Huh?! What's over 9000?! The NASDAQ?!  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: No, silly man. The baby pictures on my iPhone. I'm not tech\-savvy and I need IT to salvage my baby memories from myself. I ran out of space on my 32GB phone and I want space for the new memories.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: You got an iPhone. So, I will assume you got a Apple account. You most likely synced your pictures on the iCloud. You can download the pictures from the iCloud and once that's done. Delete them off your phone and we'll make a few tweaks so the iCloud data don't overwhelm your phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: I don't remember my account info nor I want to do that. I'm very busy and need an immediate fix.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Ma'am, you're the director of HR. You just called IT Help Desk and **started a ticket using a Dragonball Z reference from the Japanese anime cult classic, Dragonball Z**. If you want a fix, you will wait until tomorrow morning when I will be on\-site. As soon you arrive at the office, I will give you my undivided attention.  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: Are you sure you can't do this remotely? I'm a busy woman.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: The call is being recorded and I ain't risking my job over baby pictures. You're the HR Manager, **YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE WAIT!** If you cherish the pictures of your child that much, your subordinates **WILL WAIT** and when you're good and ready, you'll see them!  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: You're the 1st tech guy I ever spoke with that convinced me to wait on anything. Fine, but I expect results, $NYFranc.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Deal.

After the call, I informed my counterpart on-site Help Desk supervisor my plans for tomorrow. He saluted me for taking the challenge. After that, I popped a couple of Tylenol and guzzled them down.

The next day, I got there at 9 o'clock, sharp and entered her office. The HR director smiled instantly and told her subordinates to not disturb her until further notice.

&gt;$HR: You are a man of your word, $NYFranc. I asked about you after our call yesterday. Various staff members told me the same: direct, forceful, smart, punctual, and no.1 rule: **make sure you got COFFEE!** I wish my husband was that manly. He got money, but that's it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Thanks, let's get started.  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: Did you have your coffee?  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Yes, I did.

I planted myself down on her Executive Leather chair and she proceed to express endlessly about these three things in this order: 1) iPhone storage, 2) baby pictures, 3) Japanese Anime

I humored her on all three with whatever I knew and then my audit on her phone finished. **IT'S NOT OVER 9000 BABY PICTURES! IT'S OVER 20,000 BABY PICTURES!** Holy smokes! It's a freaking museum to first born children everywhere.

Her face flushed in embarrassment and I calmed her down and told her, ""No worries, it's my job"".

Then, I began the process of migrating 20,000 baby pictures and moving them into a flash drive. She gave me a surprise hug and talked about her 2nd baby coming in the upcoming weeks. She re-emphasized that she needs room on her phone to take more baby pictures. I advised her to get a phone with more storage, so this ticket don't have an immediate sequel.

She chuckled and waited patiently for the picture migration to finish. After two hours, it was all done. She gave her thanks to me for my hard work and she allowed her neglected subordinates permission to see her again.

An hour later, the head of IT Operations approached me and told me that he was stunned I managed to shut down Human Resource for two hours. I replied, ""**what's done is done, my friend. I didn't want this haunting me**."" He advised me to be more diplomatic with the other managers and thank me for handling the ticket.

651,My iCloud Drive is completely full of photos... Why should I trust Google with them?,"Inspired by [this tale of over 9000 baby photos to be removed from iCloud.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8pli1l/human_resources_and_its_over_9000_baby_pictures/) I recently went through a month-long saga with my neighbour trying to accomplish the same task. Fair warning, it's pretty long but there's a reward if you get to the end!  

I got a text from my neighbour that her phone was saying her iCloud storage was full and she couldn't take any more photos. Disaster, same as the 9000 baby photos lady she has thousands of pictures of her 2 kids and various animals. She has a 32Gb iPhone, a 100Gb(ish) Microsoft Surface and several 1Tb external hard drives at her disposal but was also paying monthly for 50Gb of iCloud storage. I'd been called several times before to help organise her photos and videos and transfer them to the external drives for backups because the Surface was getting full. She decided (without asking me) to start paying for iCloud so she would have all her photos backed up without my 3-hour visits every few months. She also said she wanted to use iCloud as well as the external drives because if there's a house fire, having all of your photos on external drives doesn't help. Fair enough.  

She asked if she should just pay for the next level up, 200Gb. I told her no, because she filled 50Gb in about 8 months, 200Gb wasn't much of a price increase but she's going to have the same problem in just under 2 years and the solution then will be to pay 12x what she originally agreed to. I did some research trying to find out how to set up photo stream between her phone and her Surface then found you can get an iCloud for Windows app and set up a sync between the two.    

I set up the app and start by downloading everything off her iCloud to the Surface. We are in a rural area. We get an average download speed of about 5mbps. I set it going and told her not to touch it, I was heading home and would be back tomorrow once it had downloaded all 50Gb. My intention was to download everything, back it up, then delete everything and have iCloud start again from empty.    

Came back the next day hoping to see two full download folders... nothing. About 6 photos in the 2018 folder, nothing in the 2017 folder. Shit. Forgot to change the power settings on the Surface. Screen switched off about 5 minutes after I left and stopped the download. *Sigh*. Set it going again, this time change the settings on the Surface ""Battery Power - Screen switch off NEVER"" told her again not to touch it and left. Came back a couple of days later and it still wasn't done. Took about a week total to download everything. We deleted a few of the longer videos off iCloud (after making double sure they were backed up already) to free up some space and let her take pictures again. That was mistake number 2. It immediately filled up the space we freed up with more photos that hadn't synced yet, extending the amount of time we needed to download everything to the Surface.    

This made me realise the plan wasn't going to work. As soon as we emptied her iCloud, it was immediately going to fill up with every photo still on her phone and we'd end up with duplicates everywhere and not the full 50Gb of useable space. Time for more research. I discovered the gem that is Google Photos. Same as iCloud Drive but unlimited free space for 'high quality' photos. Same sort of payment structure as iCloud for 'Original quality' photos but the limit for high quality is higher than an iPhone can take photos at anyway so it's irrelevant.  

Set up the upload to Google photos to take everything we'd just downloaded off iCloud. Our upload speed is an order of magnitude worse than our download at roughly 0.2mbps. This is the part that made it drag on. If this was my phone and my photos I was dealing with I would've switched off iCloud at this point, let google photos do its thing off the Surface and not worry about not having my photos on my phone for a bit. Because it was my neighbour I felt less comfortable with this. I didn't want to delete everything then have her turn round and say ""Where is this photo? it was the best photo I ever took of [kids]! I need it!"". I wanted to get it all done and be able to tell her ""I'm deleting every photo off your phone, but just go to this photos app instead and they're all there!"" So until google photos was done I didn't want to empty iCloud, just to be sure.   

The entire iCloud download plus the photos that were already on her Surface just about filled it so to get everything onto Google photos without slowing the Surface to a crawl required some juggling and several visits to reconfigure the Google Photos sync. Move the 2017 folder to external drive. Back up 2018 to Google, swap them over to back up 2017, then move all of it to the external drive and move the most recent back-up back to the Surface to be uploaded to Google too. I dread her asking me to put the contents of her (full) 1Tb external drive on there too once she realises how neat it is to have it all in one searchable place.   

A few weeks go by, and she finally gets sick of not being able to take photos so calls me round again to FINISH THIS, ONCE AND FOR ALL. I download the Google Photos app to her phone and set it to sync as well to make sure everything that didn't make it to iCloud is safe. I sync her phone to her computer and download everything new too just to be sure. Then I go to switch off iCloud. Hold up.  

Pressing the off button next to photos prompts a message that 8000 photos will be deleted from the phone. This was an unexpected problem. I didn't realise it would delete every photo off her phone too. Turns out the first thing it did when her 32Gb phone started to get filled up was suggest she optimise space by keeping the original photos on iCloud and only a copy on the phone. So almost every photo on her phone was only a reference to the original in iCloud not actually stored on the phone. I switched the setting to Keep Originals and it started downloading them. It quickly filled up, I deleted some apps (with permission) and some of the biggest videos but no dice. Then I realised, 32Gb phone, maybe 28Gb useable space and a completely full iCloud of 50Gb trying to download.    

I kind of hid. Gave her a brief summary of everything, told her to leave google photos open so it could back up everything it could and escaped. The next day I get a panicked text that she literally can't use her phone, everything she tries to do results in a pop up 'iPhone storage almost full!' it moved all of her apps and data to the cloud to try and make space for the photos and obviously failed. So we went nuclear. She finally decided she didn't care if some stuff went missing, she wanted her phone back! I switched off iCloud. 6000 photos hadn't managed to download and were deleted. I figured that should have cleared enough space to use her apps and stuff again, nope. Deleted all videos except for the last month, nope.  

Went through the storage options, restarted her phone a few times and finally after about 10 minutes the storage advice section popped up something useful 'Clear your recently deleted photos? You will regain 10Gb of space!' I almost threw her phone, can't believe I forgot that. Deleted everything and magically her phone became useable again. I pointed out that even with all of that she was still going to struggle for space on the phone again soon with the volume of photos she takes. Luckily Google photos has an option to delete from your device everything that has been backed up. Otherwise you have to select every photo individually. Used that to (almost) completely clear her photos out and it was finally over, a solid month after I started.    

It shouldn't have taken as long as it did. She kept saying things like  
&gt;Why do they make it so difficult to stop using iCloud?  
&gt;*Uhh, cause they want you to keep paying for it...*  
&gt;""What do you do? Why don't you use iCloud and have this problem too?""  
&gt;*I have a macbook with a 525Gb SSD and a 128Gb iPhone so my computer takes all my photos off photostream seamlessly and I have plenty of storage anyway. Plus when I take 15 photos of one thing in an attempt to get a good shot I go through them later and delete the 14 shit ones.*  
&gt;""Why is it free? What if Google decide to stop it and I lose all my photos?""  
&gt;*Why is trusting Google with them any different to trusting Apple?*   

There was some good that came out of this month-long odyssey, I got paid in puppy cuddles, she got a new cocker spaniel somewhere around week 3 and it was adorable. I also agreed with her ""What if the house burns down?"" logic and set up my own Google photos to back up everything off my computer and phone. Every photo I have is now safe and I love using it, anyone who has a large photo collection I highly recommend it. The image recognition is amazing. Someone asked about my new car the other day, I searched 'car' in google photos and it brought up every photo it identified as containing a car, including the ones where they were covered in a foot of snow! I feel like I need a \#spon or a r/hailcorporate after that, sorry! Those who made it to the end, [here's a slightly blurry reward.](https://imgur.com/a/HFxjLtm)

TL;DR My neighbour takes far too many photos, more than can be contained in any single device that she owns. Takes a month to successfully juggle them all between devices and get them backed up on both an external drive and in the cloud.

652,Changing the password on an inactive account is always a fruitless exercise,"Hi All, infrequent poster, but I don't seem to have many interesting stories that I can post without giving away too much of where I work...

Yesterday however I had a situation come up that struck me as a surprisingly new one for me and my fellow techs in my department (should have suspected it would happen one day, but we didn't think anyone would actually do this).  For quick pre\-amble to explain, I am tech support for an access control system solution.  While I do have back doors into systems, it requires a remote session, and usually either turning on said back door from in the program, or using a physical link to the server via serial cable.

I will be $me and my caller will be $HR for the rather clueless HR director who called.

&gt;$Me: Thank you for calling tech support, this is $Me speaking, may I start with your name please?

&gt;$HR: Yes, this is $HR, we have one of your \&lt;redacted, but not event quite correct company name\&gt; systems and my password stopped working, can you reset it for me?

&gt;$Me: Unfortunately, I do not have any remote administration capabilities to your system to do this, but could I get you to try logging in with the default credentials? They are *username* and *password*.

**(As a side note, I find it scary how many installers and sys admins leave these at default)**

&gt;$HR: No, that didn't work, is there any other way to fix my account?

&gt;$Me: Possibly, is there anyone else in your organization with a working login available right now?  If so I may be able to walk you through resetting your password with that login.

&gt;$HR: Yes, $HRDrone has a login and hers is working right now

&gt;$Me: Excellent, here are the instructions for her to change your password for you \&lt;Insert simple 5 step process\&gt;

&gt;$HR: Ok, I will get her to do that, I'll be right back

5 minutes later...

&gt;$HR: Ok, $HRDrone did it, and I can login now, but it says I'm not allowed to do \&lt;insert routine task here\&gt;, also we had to change my username because it said it was already in use.

Had a bit of a sinking feeling here, because as call center tech support, I am being measured on call times, and I feel like this will take much longer than it should.

&gt;$Me: Ok, would it be possible for us to do a remote session with $HRDrone so I can see what is happening and help fix your account?

&gt;$HR: Yes, that should be fine, let me transfer you to her

&gt;$HRDrone: Hello, $HRDrone speaking, how may I help you?

(Great, a cold transfer, I always love those...)

&gt;$Me: Hi $HRDrone, $HR transferred me to you so we can do a remote session and fix her account up.  Can I get you to go to \&lt;insert remote session website here\&gt;?

(Guidance on getting connected provided here)

&gt;$HRDrone: Ok, can you see my screen yet?

&gt;$Me: Yes, can you please open the Access Control system for me now, so I can get things corrected?

&gt;$HRDrone: Yes, here you go.

At this point, I searched for $HR in their system, and curiously I found 2 listings for $HR, one marked Active, the other being Inactive.  Checking the Active listing, I found an account with no logical permissions, just door access, and with no card/pin set to make use of said access.

I then proceeded to check the ""Inactive"" account, it seems to have full logical permissions to the system, has the original username too.  I changed the account to make it active, and sure enough, the login now works.  Of course, I did not leave it at this, I quickly pulled up an audit on the account, and lo and behold, marked inactive just a couple of hours prior by $HR.

From here, I gave a quick rundown of how $HR broke her own account, found out what they were *trying* to do, and advised how to actually do it.

**TL;DR** Changing the password on an inactive account is always a fruitless exercise.

Generally managing these are pretty simple, get the Fruit devices linked to the system, and push out apps, settings as necessary. 

I receive an email asking if we will be removing the remote management from the new Ipads. By design, when you factory reset the device it asks to be joined to the MDM software again and requires credentials for that to be entered. Turns out they had factory reset their iPads in hopes to connect a new fruit account... (We did not add any accounts to these as they are not needed to get programs as they are managed by the 3rd party program) 

However, what they actual did is undo part of the project they had paid for recently.

656,"The day the PFY graduated, but not before ""DAMN YOU, $BOSS"" echoed across the room","I was once $Boss, and from time to time I had PFYs (Pimply-Faced Youths, young/inexperienced in IT) reporting to me.  Sometimes I got to watch them grow so much in skill and confidence that they ceased to become a PFY almost right before my eyes.  But, in this case, not without one last hiccup.

To recap from my earlier story about this PFY ([Never squander a good outage](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8k4ad4/never_squander_a_good_outage_and_how_to_train_a/)):

/// cue flashback ///

&gt; I was constantly trying to drill into the PFYs:

&gt; 1) Check the simple things first.  EVERY simple thing.

&gt; 2) Question all assumptions.

&gt; 3) Don't give up

&gt; When a PFY got stuck and came to me for help, I would always ask about the simple stuff before giving other advice. (You've got to LIVE the rules to internalize them.)

&gt; At the beginning, this would result in many trips back to the equipment, to personally verify that it was plugged in, that the power cable was seated properly (on both ends!), that the network cable was plugged in, etc. This was always accompanied by a quantity of annoyed muttering.

&gt; As they got better, they would come to me saying, ""The box won't turn on, and I've checked both ends of the power cable, verified the outlet works, etc...""

/// back to the story... ///

So one day I had this conversation with a PFY:

&gt; Me: I need you to install Linux on this computer.  It'll ask you a few questions.  Here are the answers you'll need.

&gt; PFY: I've never used Linux.  I don't know anything about it.

&gt; Me: I know.  That's why I assigned the task to you.

&gt; PFY: Oh.  &lt;eye roll&gt; Great. &lt;/eye roll&gt;

PFY had been with the company for awhile by this point, and was getting to be good.  I knew he could handle it.

Off he went to the workbench in the lab.  It was in the opposite corner of our open-plan office from my desk.  He started off fine.  Then it started getting noisy.  I heard grunts.  Groans.  ""Dammit!""  And other visible signs of frustration.  But I left him alone.

And he didn't give up.  It was a personal thing with him now - he was determined to solve problems himself, without asking me for help.  He hated it when I solved a problem that he couldn't.  So he kept at it.  Googled, power cycled, everything.

Finally, after an entire hour and a half of frustration, he came over to me.

&gt; PFY: I just can't get this thing on the network.  And before you ask, I've checked everything.

&gt; Me: Any error messages?

&gt; PFY: Yes.  [ shows me ]

&gt; Me: That means the NIC doesn't see a network link.

&gt; PFY: I know.  But I made sure it's plugged in!

&gt; Me: Is the switch working?

(There was a little desktop switch underneath the workbench.)

&gt; PFY: Yeah, other machines on it are working.

&gt; Me: Then go back and double check the network cable to the PC.  Make sure it's plugged in tight on both ends.

&gt; PFY: I'm sure it's fine.  I've checked it at least 20 times!

&gt; Me: Just do it.

&gt; PFY: &lt;really annoyed&gt; FINE.  &lt;stomps off noisily&gt;

20 second later, echoing throughout the entire open-plan office, we hear, VERY loudly:

&gt; PFY: DAMN YOU, $BOSS!

Soft chuckles echo around the office...

He came over to my desk.

&gt; Me, unable to entirely suppress my grin: Oh, was the network cable unplugged?

&gt; PFY: Yes.  The network cable was unplugged.  AT THE SWITCH.

That was the very last time the PFY missed something obvious.  He went on to work for several tech companies, being a star tech at each, and recently getting a thoroughly-deserved promotion.

One day.... Oh yes, one day he will have PFYs.  On that day, I'm going to call him up and ask him to check his network cable.",False,3041,195,Universal_Binary,talesfromtechsupport

658,"""The whole system is down! Get there now!""","backstory:  I (FatGuy) spent a summer working as a sort of IT guy at my Dad's (Dad) office after his long-time IT guy/Office Manager retired abruptly.  This was a small doctor's office with probably around 12-15 employees.  I was by no means an IT expert, but I could fix most of the issues that came up, which 9 times out of 10 were ""the printer won't work.""  in the very rare case that it was something I couldn't solve with a quick google, I knew enough to not mess with anything, and outside of adding a user to the Active Directory once, I generally left the main server alone.

&amp;nbsp;

Most of the women working there (office was pretty much all women) could use a computer well enough to do their jobs and get to facebook but that was about the extent of it.  There was one early-mid 40s big redneck woman in particular that was completely computer illiterate...for the sake of this story, let's call her Kevin.  Kevin had been a receptionist at the office for at least 5 years.

&amp;nbsp;

Scene: 7:30am, morning of 4th of July.  

&amp;nbsp;

Me: passed out after drinking with my buddies the night before.

&amp;nbsp;

Dad: (throws bedroom door open...running in in a panic) **FATGUY! WAKE UP!  There's something major going on at the office.  I think we've got a virus or something!  The whole system is down! You gotta get there now!!**

Me: Good one dad....it's 4th of July and even if it wasn't the office doesn't open until 9.

Dad: This isn't a joke.  Kevin came in to get caught up on a few things.  She's down there right now and just called.  She said the machines keep crashing when she tries to turn them on....she's about to try to get on the server and see what it does.

&amp;nbsp;

Me: **YOU KEEP KEVIN OFF THAT SERVER! I'M LEAVING NOW** (the thought of Kevin touching the server immediately put me into a panic)

&amp;nbsp;

after making record time to the office ...

Me: Okay Kevin, I need you to show me exactly what's happening

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin: (flustered) Okay, well I tried to turn on my computer and it gets halfway through the loading screen and then just turns off.  Then I tried another computer and it won't even turn on at all. See, watch.

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin walks to her computer, presses the power button, the machine starts to boot...I notice Kevin is still holding the power button...the machine turns back off.  Then Kevin walks to second computer, presses the power button, ""See, it won't even start to turn on...the screen is still black....what the hell is going on?""

**$HRHero** - one of the first times I've ever been thrilled beyond words by HR  

My company has a policy that all distribution groups are formatted in a specific way for searchability and also professionalism.  

Generally it's ""Department-TeamName.Function"" - So Dev-ProductName.Beta1 for the Beta 1 testers of our product that Dev is working on.    
Simple enough and no one has had ANY problems with it since they started enforcing it.  

Enter the Scrum Masters.  We hired about 5 of them last year and most of them (including $""ScrumMaster"") are good people who work hard - my personal bias against their job role aside, I won't ever claim they aren't dedicated and hard workers.   

After their teams started coalescing, we started getting...odd...team name requests (yes, I get it, they're probably in line with Agile's principles).    
* Team Narwhal  
* Team Spacegoats  
* Team Unicorn  
* (and the one from today, Team Kiwi)  

When I got the distribution request for Team Spacegoats from $""Scrum Master"" I immediately forwarded it to $BWISODS and asked him if this was an appropriate name for us to have, even if we prefix it with Dev-.   


Part of the issue is these distros are sometimes used for client/customer facing emails.   
I really take issue to a professional development company, emailing professional [our industry here] customers regarding product we are trying to develop and sell from an email address of Team.SpaceGoats@company.com.  

$BWISODS agreed with me and told me to shut it down.  I denied the ticket request with verbage equating to 
&gt; ""This was denied by upper management.  Please direct any issues with this request to upper IT management""  

For the next three weeks I received daily emails asking $Me about why the ticket was denied.  I responded, always professionally with 
&gt; ""This was not my decision to deny this group, please contact $BWISODS for the reasoning behind it""   
Finally after a couple weeks, I got one final email: 
 
$""Scrum Master"":  

&gt; I still do not understand why this is not allowed to be a distribution group name.  We need this distribution group because it defines our identity as a team.   
I get the need for professional purposes, but why can't I have Team Spacegoats for a distribution list name???


Eventually the emails subsided and all around stopped.  

Today, I got a new ticket that came in asking for a new distro to be created, this time of the name ""Team Kiwi""  

Before I even had a chance to read the ticket notes, $BWISODS emails me and says ""Just...no""   
I had to talk to $BWISODS about something else this morning so I mentioned Team Kiwi to $BWISODS.  

$BWISODS laughed and asked me if he ever told $Me what happened with Team Spacegoats.   

Turns out... after $""Scrum Master"" sent me that last email, $""Scrum Master"" went to **$HRHero** about this.   $""Scrum Master"" *formally complained about this issue to $HRHero*  
$""Scrum Master's"" complaint included the verbage that $BWISODS unfairly denied this request and that there was no reason for it to be denied.   
$HRHero's response is legendary:  
&gt; ""This request was rightfully denied by $BWISODS.  In fact, if $BWISODS had approved this name change, I would have fired him personally once I found out.

So when I set up the modem+router combo unit I asked the customer what name and password they would like for their WiFi. They gave me a name and the password was _____011. I entered this into the modem and then SHOWED her my screen so she could confirm it was correct. She says it is fine and writes it down.

While I wait for the WiFi name to get changed I go and explain how to use the tvs and then she pulls out her macbook to connect to the WiFi. She tries to connect and gets incorrect password. Hm. Well she probably just typed it in wrong happens all the time. This time I see the paper she wrote and see her type it in and bam same incorrect password. That is strange. So I take her macbook and try myself and same thing. She decides to leave me to it while she keeps unpacking.

So I am connected on my device so I know it is working. Well did some research and says sometimes might have issues connecting to 2.4 and only connects to 5. Our new modem gives both networks the same name so I go in and differentiate them by adding -5G to the 5 band. I try again and same incorrect password error on both 2.4 and 5. I try rebooting the macbook and try again. Nothing. I go into network wifi settings and try forgetting a couple of the old networks and toggling WiFi off and back on. STILL nothing. I reboot the modem (REALLY didn't want to because I am connected just fine and it can take up to 20mins to fully boot up and for diagnostics to show up and I can't leave the job without the diagnostics showing up). 

After I wait for everything to come back up I try again and still does not connect. I am getting increasingly frustrated and I decide I am going to just try changing the password. I log back in and go to the password and see _____011 and then I realize what the damn problem is. This old lady told me _____011 and then wrote down _____001. I brought this to her attention and she says, ""Yea _____001 that is correct."" Then I tell her she told me _____011 and then also checked it when I showed het and said it was fine. So I went back in and changed it to _____001 and connected everything just fine. So yeah, totally my fault for not realizing she did not write down what she told me.

TL;DR: Cust chooses wifi name and password, but writes down different password and then states thats the password she wanted after 40 minutes of not being able to connect.

Wednesday morning. Ticket comes in. “We are still having trouble with our phones, can we please have someone look at them?” Director grabs it again. This is really weird…


I IM him, “Hey do you need me to take a look at those?” 


&gt;Him: No, we are handling it.


&gt;Me: You know, if we got rid of the call center we wouldn’t have these issues…


&gt;Him: LOL


This morning the entire call center is laid off…

&gt;Him: Too late, took your advice


We had just set up a new call center that shared responsibilities with each. I personally thought it was because we were growing but I was told it was because they want to have the call center in the town the corporate office is in.

664,Permission Denied means Out of Memory,"I work part-time at an IT helpdesk at my university. We don't usually get anything more complex here than a Mac user having trouble using the university's printers because the instructions provided by the university are missing a step, so this one was a little unexpected!

The administration here has been trying to use some piece of software to perform optical character recognition on teaching assistant evaluations. Except every time the scanned PDFs were read by the software, it would read one page then spit out a permission denied error.

While we worked on figuring out why this error was appearing in the first place (the program definitely had access to its own ""temp"" folder!) PDFs were read using a temporary workaround we discovered. The program would read one page before spitting out an error the first time it was read, but if all the data was deleted and the PDF was read again, it would read two pages this time! Each successive page would then be read with further delete-and-reread operations.

The manufacturer's knowledgebase indicated that the error was definitely a permissions error and gave several suggestions to try - all of which failed. After contacting their own tech support team (they were quick! If the tech who responded to our ticket 30 minutes after we sent it in reads this, you're awesome.) we learned it was not a permissions error at all, but in fact a system resource issue. Since the PDFs had been scanned in a different orientation than the template, the software was using too many resources attempting to flip the pages around in order to read them, and failing. We got the administrative computer an Adobe Acrobat license, flipped all the PDFs 90 degrees, and the admin was able to complete their OCR task without any more hiccups.",False,161,11,ITKangaroo,talesfromtechsupport

Client calls and tells me that her laptop is taking a literal hour to boot and bring up Windows, and once its up it's nearly unusable. She tells me that it started shortly after the last Windows Creators update. I ask her to bring it by the house. 

&amp;nbsp;

me: So let's take a look at it. 

client: See, it comes up but it's taking forever just to login. I called my IT department and they're sending me more RAM.

me: IT dept? This isn't *your* laptop? 

client: No, work sent it to me. 

me: [Taking my hands off it] Whoa, nope. Sorry. You need to go through them, I can't touch another companies tech. They likely won't pay and you'll end up in trouble. 

client: [Smarter than she seems] Nope, here's the email on my phone. I already asked for permission to bring it to you because I don't know how to install the memory. [Pulls up an email chain between her boss (the VP of Sales) and Johnny IT, and forwards it to me.] 

me: Seems like the hard drive is clicking, and nothing is pulling up after the initial login. I can try and pull the hard drive and copy everything off? Might take me an hour. Say, $60? 

client: Sure, can you get me a price on installing the RAM they sent, a new hard drive, and Windows? 

me: Yep. [Mocks up a price sheet, email it to client.]

client: Great, I sent that off to my boss. Let me know when it's ready and I'll swing back by.

client: [text message] Hey, Johnny IT says that *their* version of Windows is different, so you don't need to install one. 

me: Great, do they want to send the image over? Or are you going to send it back to home office? 

client: Hold on, I got a strange email from VP of Sales.

&gt; I've talked it over with Johnny IT and it seems that the local guy is either incompetent or is attempting to overcharge you. We don't have a Windows image for him to install and we won't pay for a new one. HP laptops come with a free Windows image.

me: Alright, come pick her up. She's useless, but she's paid for. Say where did you get this ""work"" laptop from?

me: They didn't have it sent to them first to have *their image* installed? Lol

And that is the story of how I got paid to *not* fix a computer.

**Aftermath:** 

Eventually, client came back and paid me out of her own pocket to install a Windows image, using the license that Windows auto-assigned based on the hardware. After all that, it turns out it was just a basic home license and they didn't have any special software.

666,CEOs and their printers: Part 2,"[Part 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8osbcy/ceos_and_their_printers/)

One day as I'm working at my desk like normal, I see an email come through. Something about our Provost having printer problems. This should be fun...as I'm reading it, my boss comes up to make to ask if I got the email, and if I can take care of it. I let her know I would. The email was forwarded from our CIO's assistant (CIOA), original from the Provost's assistant. Let's call her EA for Executive Assistant.

""$Provost has requested a new color printer. I didn't want to put a work order in because I wanted to see if you can have someone handle this ASAP. Can you recommend a new color printer for him? He currently has an HP. He wants this removed from him office as soon as the new one comes in.""

I let out a heavy sigh and call EA before going to find another printer.

&gt;$Me: So can you give me a rundown of what's going on with the printer?

&gt;$EA: Every once in awhile a message pops up on the menu. He asks me to look at it, I clear it. But then it comes back and I don't know what to do about. He's tired of dealing with it, he just wants a new one.

&gt;$Me: And you haven't $Vendor about it or even placed a ticket with us whenever the message came up?

&gt;$EA: No.

&gt;$Me: Alright, since I was already given instruction to replace it, I'll see what I can find. I don't exactly know what our stock is so it will take me some time to make sure it's working without issue.

I go down to our stockroom and locate the ""dead printer"" from the last story. Still just sitting there, collecting dust (a lot of times takes place between these stories) I boot it up and try to run some test prints, one of the toners seems to be out there and I can't find a replacement. I start checking other color printers and they either have problems or have no toner. I never seem to have the downtime to call our vendor on these.

I finally remember we have an extra unused printer from a ticket I did a few months ago. CIOA did order the printer requested for the ticket, then ordered another one on accident, thinking that she hadn't ordered it (things like this happen enough, see [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/6polw9/because_ordering_things_is_hard/) here). I asked her to process a return for it to get our money back and spend it on supplies we actually need. She said she talked to Dell, the vendor, and they refunded the money over the misunderstanding but didn't need to return the printer.

So now I have a Dell color printer I can give $Provost. It may not be our standard but it's not unheard of in the environment and we can add it to our service contract. I get to his office and he's there, but leaves as soon as I get there to let me install the printer. It's a USB printer if I remember correctly so it's pretty straight forward. I run some test prints and confirm it's good to go.

I take out the old printer and talk with $EA about the new one. I let her know I'd be putting it on a service contract that would cover supplies and repair. I would send her the information as soon as it's added, and to please call them as soon as something happens on the printer and avoid us having to replace it again.

After I got back and set the old printer aside to have it repaired, I sent off an email to my boss and CIOA, explaining the issue and what could have been prevented had $EA just called our vendor. Citing this example and my last tale, I said that the University is throwing money away by paying for a monthly support contract on these printers, and then never using them. Then even more money gets wasted on new printers that don't have to be bought. I urged them to explain this to the higher-ups in this sense and maybe they'd understand things from a financial perspective, considering we're not in a great position right now.

You'd think that would be the end of that, but there's one last part to this story. When something $Provost's new printer broke down, a coworker of mine was called over to try and fix it. When he couldn't, he called $Vendor and placed a ticket. $Provost didn't like how long he'd have to wait for them to fix it, so he wanted a backup printer in place until then. $CW brought over one and set it up, then had to go and switch the printers back once his main one was fixed. So now he has a backup printer in his office.",False,157,31,superzenki,talesfromtechsupport
667,"Using serial numbers to work out the difference between 1/I, O/0 and B/8","A recent story here brought back some bad memories I thought my good friend Jack had buried.


**Wiggly lines.** (No, not the ones from a broken CRT, those pesky memory ones)


There I was, a young jelly, turboing around his new temp job. Well, I say new, I had been working at the other site (closer to home) and had recently been moved to this one due them hiring someone with a degree that didn't last as long as I did. Unfortunetly for me the other site had been pretty good at equipment disposal and while I had worked on it, I wasn't prepared for The Room Of Discarded ~Crap~ Equipment. This room was on the 2nd floor (3rd for you yanks) of a building, it was a sturdy room but there were no classrooms at this level, which meant no disability lifts Of course, being English, the lifts worked up until the Management had annouced it open and slapped themselves on the back for being so disabled aware, at which point they promptly broke and were covered in tape (both litterally and figuretly). The room also worked as a heat trap.


So one hot summers day I was assigned to the 1st of a 3 part ~nightmare~ plan. Move old equipment into the room. You see, old equipment was dumped everywhere, server room, backup room (that contained the universities generators), the equipment room (""I'll break it down later"") and a random triangular shaped room IT used because no one else wanted it. We had a trolley, but as tradition goes, its wheels were the envy of every surly shopping trolley. Work work work.


Part 2. Asset time! You may remeber from a previous tale of just how much I want to say ""**Thank** you"" to people who placed serial numbers. This is where it started. Pages and pages of handwritten notes of all sorts of s/n's where produced by me. The work was roasting and the preassure to finish was pushing down on me. When I reached my limit I managed to escape the heat trap to the air conditioned calm of the office where I got to have the interesting task of inputting my written figures into excel. Now, I expect by now you can see my typing skills aren't the best, my handwriting skills are far worse. Trying to define between I/1 0/O and B/8 on the equipment was hard, working it out from my scrawled hand was even harder. Many mistakes where made, many repeated trips to recheck s/n's where performed. Finally I had a technique down, with extra strong lines on 1's. Lines through 0's and very straight B's. Day after day I repeated my own version of Sisyphus until finally, the boulder stayed at the top of the hill. I was free! Or so I thought.


Part 3 was thrn revealed. Move all equipment into an empty ground floor room across campus for the disposal company to collect and do the paper work, but you csn't guess where this empty room was in relation to the rooms I had moved equipment out of several weeks before, actually, I bet you can. The paper work was easy enough though, a couple of functions pulled all the relavant information out and auto completed the form for me. Moving the equipment I had lugged upstairs back down again helped me discover my spirit could become an Olympic Limbo Champion. Yet I persisted and I won. Well I thought I had. When the delivery lorry turned up, it was a 2/3 full transit van.

So I help my brother from time to time, now he's an ISP only, but a few years ago he provided satellite TV and IPTV which he gave up due to countless tales such as this.

So we're wiring up an apartment for ADSL, and he's doing the final touches so asks me to pop to one around the corner. It's a French woman who says her satellite receiver isn't working and has been bugging him for days (he didn't supply the box or satellite so had no recourse to get there immediately). So I get there and take a look.

Box is powered on, ok. So let's check the scart cable... Seems fine. Tv is on the correct input and has a signal, but is just displaying a black screen. Try to access the box settings and nothing happens when I press the remote.

I work for an $ISP which offers IPTV, and when I started I took customer calls on shifts. This was about four years ago. One evening I got a call from a customer complaining that her TV signal had lost all color, and was showing the picture in black-and-white. The particular set top box we used had a component output (SCART, since we are in Europe), so was she using that? No, she had a modern TV and used HDMI. After a bit more back-and-forth, we figured out that other channels were fine, the problem was limited to this particular channel.

So I brought up that channel on our test system, and sure enough, it was desaturated, all black-and-white. The channel was TCM, and they were showing a movie that had been made in the 1940s: a black-and-white movie.",False,423,31,stereoroid,talesfromtechsupport
670,The toilet partition that took down an entire building's internet...,"Sub title:  Why did you put the server *there*? 

Okay, while I wasn't in tech support at the time, this was some what my fault; and since then it's left me wondering what the particular company was thinking...if at all.

Several years ago, my father and I ran a company where we installed toilet partitions in bathrooms.  It was a pretty high paying job (figure 5 to 10 grand per bathroom), with relatively easy work load. No more than three or four hours a day, if that. Depending on the number of bathrooms being installed, that is.

In this particular case, we had been called in to replace the partitions in every bathroom on the floor for this company.  They had recently been purchased, and that floor (previously unused) was being converted into a cube farm.  Since the floor hadn't been finished in the first place, we needed to add all the fixtures and partitions.  Due to various laws in place, we were limited in the type of hangers we could use, settling on something called ""full height"" brackets.  Basically an aluminum channel that goes the full height of the partition, and attaches at three or four places, as opposed to the usual small brackets and two attachment points.

In any case, after checking the building plans to make sure we weren't going to accidentally drill into anything dangerous, like power cables, or water lines for sprinkler systems, we set to work getting ready.  The first few bathrooms went fine, with us getting two or three done before we ran into problems.  

About halfway through the next install, one of the crew complained that he had 'hit' something with his drill.  That something had produced all manner of aluminum strips and scrap, making him think he'd hit a metal beam or something.  He hadn't been shocked, nor had water started spraying through the hole; so we told him to stop where he was while we sort out what happened.

We're consulting the plans, finding that there wasn't anything in that particular wall, when a rather harried fellow came running into the room.

&gt;Fellow:  What did you just do? You shut us down! Fix it, fix it now!

&gt;Me:  Wait...what?

&gt;Fellow:  We just went dark, and customers have business to do! This has to be your fault!

&gt;Me:  We're hanging partitions...so how is this *our* fault?

&gt;Fellow:  I don't know, it just is.

We immediately stopped work, and started investigating. It didn't take long to figure out what we'd hit.  Walking around outside the cube farm area, we discovered a locked door; complete with a rather interesting keypad entry.  Calling down to the building security, we informed them of the problem and asked what was behind the door.  After several minutes of searching, they informed us that it was the server farm for the company. 
Oh... great.

Eventually someone from IT popped up on the floor, and after much complaining and consideration, agreed to check the damage.  Guy returned about five minutes later to inform us that we'd hit a server.  So... yeah.  The guy had drilled through the wall, the back of the server, and right into one of the blades. (how the guy didn't get shocked is beyond me.)  This was likely to cost us dearly.

Thankfully we ended up being off the hook when it was revealed that there wasn't any interior drywall in the server room.  Literally it was just open support channels, and one sheet of plaster (drywall) hastily plunked on the outside to make it look secure.  No one ever expected someone to have to drill into it, and didn't consider the consequences of having the servers less than an inch from the newly hung drywall.

Company ended up losing quite a bit from that, I'm told, both from the less than secure nature of their server farm; and the damage caused.  It took us another month to finally finish the contract, after another construction crew had to be paid to actually secure and finish the server room.  

The company closed about a year later, having gone bankrupt.  Given how blasé they were about security...I can't say i'm surprised.

672,Two gaffs by same government organisation!,"Someone posted on here yesterday about drilling through into a server room and it reminded me of two stories nearly 10 years ago when I was doing 2nd line support and project roll out work for a government organisation here in the UK.

This public sector organisation/company I contracted with for nearly 4 years had several buildings on a site where each building varied in age. As money was tight, moving sites or upgrading buildings was way down on the list of things to do. One building where our IT team was based had a toilet and shower on an upper floor. This room just happened to be above a newish server room and small data centre. There was an unfortunate incident where a toilet pipe burst over a weekend resulting in the whole IT department being called in asap by worried security.

This pipe bursted and resulted in leaving a lot of servers and equipment covered in an unknown brown/black smelly liquid/semi solid goo. I can only imagine a scene out of ghostbusters when the pressure must have released out of the pipe. It was only by chance that another alarm went off in the building that security had gone to investigate. Luckily nothing actually penetrated any cases or chassis to cause damage but very close to taking out a small data centre IMHO. We decided to throw away a lot of monitors, cables and odds and sods rather than clean them. Needless to say a few years later that server room was moved off site and a lot of it virualized. The citrix server they had was therefore known as the ""shit server"" whenever it crashed. 

I swear for about 6 months after there was a musky damp smell in that room made worse by the aircon circulating it. Backups would often failed on one of the servers but as management were so busy with user issues this was not a priority! MIND BOGGLES they got lucky with only about 8 hours down time whilst we cleaned the place up.

This same team/department a few years previous when I had not long started as a contractor had made another gaff in the same building. They had decided to use an upstairs room to store old crt monitors and computers during a hardware fresh swap over to flat screens and new computers. This room housed two pallets of new equipment and was the dumping ground for all the old crt monitors and computers. All that extra weight had caused the floor to start creaking and making noises. 

Someone from the accommodation team advised with the building being so it wasn't a good idea to store a couple of tonnes of IT equipment in there. Literally years and years of old computers, crt monitors and furniture had to be removed over a weekend without the aid of a lift. I remember finding anold 14"" touch screen crt monitor, a 386 IBM PCm boxes of old floppy disks and an old Yamaha 1980s musical keyboard.

They were already on our radar as compelete morons, so we made them a document with pictures, indicating what to move, how to move it, how to power it down, and how to set it back up again once it's at the destination. The key piece of information here is that we told them to remove the PSUs while in transit. The same with the disks in the JBOD (they're all labelled), which have their own shock resistant packages.

**Me**: Okay, is it plugged in, and is the power to the device turned on at the switch?

**Moron1**: Erm, yep, it's plugged in.

**Moron1**: Yes. *whispers to his colleague in another language*

**Moron2**: Hello, what you want me to do?

**Me**: I need to make sure the server you're looking at is plugged in, and that the PSUs are showing a red light.

**Moron2**: Yes.

**Me**: \*sigh\*, okay. One sec.

**Me**: Do me a favour. Try to push the PSUs into the device, you might hear a click.

**Moron2**: Okay now there is a red light on them.

**Me**: So when I asked you earlier if there was a red light, and you said yes, what did you mean?

**Moron2**: Yes, the red light is on now.

**Moron2**: It's on now.

**Me**: Great, is the JBOD, the big box full of hard drives connected to the front of the server?

So now I'm trying to connect, and the ENTIRE raid is degraded. It's not detecting any disks as valid, which is odd because there is multiple redundancy.

&gt; $User: Oh, its rebooting now! Is it done?!

 

&gt; $Selben: Let’s wait for it to reboot…

 

$Selben finished all his notes for the ticket, then stared down at the time, waiting for it to magically speed up, while occasionally responding to the customer with the occasional ‘Yep, just wait! And what do you see now?’.

 

&gt; $User: It’s working now!

 

&gt; $Selben: Great, have a wonderful weekend!

 

&gt; $User: Okay, bye!

 

$Selben then along with all the other techs returned to staring at the empty call queue

 

With two hours remaining, $Selben watched as a couple other techs finished their shifts, nodding in solidarity as they headed out. Another hour passed with no calls or emails, $Selben sat quietly. $Sup1 was on his cell chatting with someone, looking a bit more cheerful as the day was finally coming to an end. Once $Selben was off his shift, $Sup1 could also leave - from what he overheard $Selben concluded $Sup1 had a date. With ten minutes left, naturally $Selben’s phone began to ring, he could practically feel the dagger like eyes from $Sup1 across the room.

 

&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling, this is $Selben.

 

A panicked voice came from the other side.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: This is $HRDrone from HR!

 

&gt; $Selben: Okay.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: I need to take care of something urgently! But you can’t look at it, because the information is confidential! I need this file completely encrypted!

 

&gt; $Selben: Okay, no problem! That should only take a couple minutes.

 

$Sup1 stood next to $Selben’s desk, pointing at his watch. $Selben muted the call briefly and explained it was someone from HR. $Sup1 threw his hands in the air and stomped back to his office.

$Selben was eventually able to get $HRDrone to give up some of the “classified information.” It was something that had to do with a legal issue, so to be emailed around it needed to be encrypted. Simple enough. $Selben offered to connect in and show how to use the software they normally use. However, $HRDrone refused to let him connect in case he tried to look at the files. (*Sigh*) After two and a half hours, $Selben was finally able to walk $HRDrone through installing the software and encrypting the file. $HRDrone seemed happy about the success and finally the call ended.

 

No sooner had the receiver hung up, $Sup1 was practically pulling $Selben out of his chair and pushing him out the door. Besides the minor delay, $Selben had a good holiday weekend. The whole company was off, and the IT Department was included - three worry-free days of bliss.

 

Naturally upon returning to work Tuesday morning, $Selben was ~~ambushed then captured~~ greeted and taken to a side office by some HR ~~minions~~ employees. $HRDrone, $Sup2, and the head of HR were already waiting. Everyone was very upset, so $Selben sat and patiently waited to be fired for something he had (or hadn’t) done. After the long weekend it’s sometimes tough bounce back into things without coffee.

 

&gt; $HRLead: I need to know why things were handled *this* way.

 

&gt; $Sup2: Please explain to us what the problem is.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: HE! (*points at $Selben*) took forever to encrypt my files and then it didn’t even work. I’m betting is was because he was in a rush to leave on Friday. This is poor customer service!

 

&gt; $Sup2: $Selben is more than capable of running the encryption software. I doubt he just didn’t do it.

 

&gt; $Selben: Ah, well, I was told to not connect to the machine, so I spent two and a half hours walking $HRDrone through the process.

 

$Sup2 raised an eyebrow.

 

&gt; $HRLead: Why wouldn’t you let him connect? He’s part of IT.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: It’s part of *The Files*

 

&gt; $HRLead: You mean *The Files*?! Of course they can’t see them!

 

$Selben refrained from letting his eyes roll into the back of his head.

 

&gt; $Sup2: Okay, let’s just fix this - can we look at the file?

 

After much convincing that seeing a filename wouldn’t let IT know the contents of *The File*, they got $HRDrone to show *The File*. As $Selben expected, it was encrypted, and no issue could be seen by him or $Sup2.

 

&gt; $Sup2: So, what’s the…

 

$HRDrone interrupted, holding up a hand with a smug look. He opened an email, dated before the call to $Selben on Friday, where the file had been shared with him from $HRLead, and opened it.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: See, it’s not encrypted at all! Also, watch this.

 

$HRDrone pulled out a thumb drive. $Selben bit his lip after making the realization of what was about to happen. $HRDrone put the drive into his machine and was able to open the file stored on it without decrypting it as well.

 

$Sup2 and $Selben glanced over at $HRLead, who had gone quiet. His jaw was actually dropped. $Selben was impressed at how closely $HRLead suddenly resembled a cartoon character.

 

&gt; $Sup2: Okay, I’ve seen enough. $HRLead, we will schedule some training for your staff on how encryption works in the next week.

 

&gt; $HRLead: Agreed.

 

As a recap, $HRDrone thought once you encrypted a file that ALL copies of the file in any location would also be encrypted. All HR reps were scheduled to go through a mandatory training over the next month on how to use the encryption software and expectations of how it should function.",False,1157,94,Selben,talesfromtechsupport
675,Tales From Aircraft Maintenance (sort of): Tank you very much,"A few years back I was deployed to $DeployedLocation. I was assigned to our local command post equivalent for a few months because I was “good with computers”. Our setup was most definitely austere. The squadron was set up in a mix of cargo containers, tents and other scavenged equipment. There were permanent facilities nearby but we were not welcome there due to my officer being a selfimportantjackass. I, however, was able to secure a single network link to connect us to their network and the outside world.

Being an avionics tech, I knew the basics of signal flow and the basics of how networks function. That made me the IT guy for my unit. The problem was, our “compound” was located across the street from where I could get the line run from. Being the highly skilled scrounger and all\-around McGyver that I am, I took one of my airmen and fabricated a steel guard so cars wouldn’t run over the cable and destroy it. It worked for a few weeks…

…until a tank ran over my cable guard and crushed it.

My officer, being who he was, demanded I fix it immediately and he didn’t care how. Once again, I take my airman and go a’scrounging. I was unable to locate another length of cat5 that would run the length I needed and was unable to secure crimpers to make my own cable. We did locate a few patch cables and my airman had one of his better ideas.

Solve the problem with duct tape. We patched in several lengths of cat5 into the crushed cable and used duct tape to splice and bind the patched lengths.

Problem 2. We cannot run it across the road again. There are trees lining this road on both sides.

I boost my airman into the tree and we run the cable up one tree (bound with duct tape), through the tree (bound with duct tape), across to the other and down.

We restored network connectivity in under 3 hours after a tank ran over our network cable.

As a thank you for my effort, my officer sent me back to the flightline and back to turning jets.

676,"""What do you mean I didn't check where the buried lines were?"" an Air Force story","First deployment was Kuwait.  

I was a comm guy in a fairly sleepy shop.  About the most we had to do was monitor circuits, update crypto, run wiring inside buildings, and once a night we had to turn the porno off.

Anywho, people don't really recognize how much of a pain in the ass rain is in the desert.  Out in the sand, its not an issue, it drains quickly and its like it was never there.  However where people build and live just under the sand is this hard-packed amalgamation of sand, rock, and other crap that doesn't let the water drain.  Half an hour of rain can lead to a foot of standing water in some places.

Well, spring rains came one night and drenched the entire base.  A road down by the flightline was completely cut off by the rain.  Some of the Security Forces (cops) were upset that they couldn't patrol the entire flightline and were whining about that (they were likely more upset that one idiot drove his cop car straight down the road and sank it so the hood was below the water.)  So the Security Forces commander calls the Civil Engineering commander and gets some guys down there with a wide variety of heavy equipment, including some goober with a ditch witch.

Somewhere around midnight they get to work cutting a channel to best allow the water to drain.  Almost the very first thing they do is run across a fiber optic bundle that supplied internet and the various secure comm lines to the entire base.  Everyone got woken up, even people that had no knowledge of repairing fiber optics (meaning me) and were put to work.  Somehow I managed to get chosen to work with C.E. and verify where the buried lines were.  This basically meant slogging through knee-deep to mid-thigh freezing water trying to find flags.  Until that had been completed our commander didn't allow any more C.E. involvement other than that necessary to unearth enough of the bundle for us to repair it.  About halfway through that C.E. was able to get a pump setup and start draining the water.

Ended up taking the guys fixing the bundle 5-6 hours standing mid-thigh in freezing cold water to get the bare necessities back up and running and get the planes flying.

Imagine if you drew a line down the middle and bent the laptop roughly 90 degrees about that line. That's what rolled into our desktop queue on Monday, with a note that said ""can you recover data? important thesis work,"" along with the client's contact details.

I later learned the client was walking at the top of a tall winding staircase surrounding a large open column of air (perfect for dropping things down, apparently) and they dropped their laptop off the edge after tripping. 8 unfortunate stories later, this laptop managed to break the floor tiles at the bottom of the stairs, and the laptop itself, which landed on its edge, looked liked someone stronger than I had gotten angry and just bent the thing across the middle.

The poor tech who got assigned this one was considering writing it off as an impossible recovery job, but when we looked at the client's details and realized who we were dealing with, we decided that it might be a good idea to at least try. (That's a different story.) After a bit of prying, we managed to get the bottom plate off of the device, and realized that we had previously replaced the HDD with an SSD for this same client. A glimmer of hope came out of this discovery, and the tech quickly worked to remove the SSD from the chassis. The logic board, snapped in two, was unsalvageable to an almost comical extent, but the SSD came out without any problems and had no data corruption whatsoever.

First of all, the URL the head included in the email was wrong. Second, there was no indication where the user was located (onsite, offsite, at a colocation, etc). Last, no contact information was provided for the user except for an email address (oh, and not to be forgotten, no ticket was opened).

I sigh as I explain to my junior tech ($jt) the missing information and how to respond to such requests.

$dev comes over after I verified the site actually works, and the following conversation ensued:

ME (to $jt): ...so the only thing I can do at this point is assume nothing and email this person to reach out to me so I can ask a few questions.

$JT: I see. So everything is working, but this person just can't get on?

$DEV: Like reading their instructions?

I looked at the email, and it was a thread that included attached instructions on what they need to do to access our RDS system, both locally and remotely.

679,Where did my data go?,"So a little backstory for this, I had been the sole employee of a branch of a small computer store. We had 3 locations and mine just existed because they didn't want to close the store. This also meant that when several employees quit and there wasn't enough people to handle the work at the other stores I got the excess workflow.

3 characters in this story.  
$ME: James Franco  
$AO: Asshole store Owner
$CX: Clueless Customer

# Act 1: Set up for failure

As mentioned before, several people had quit so there was a lot of overflow. The main branch sent me all of the computers that needed windows reinstalled. I had gotten a call from the owner.

&gt;$AO: ""What's taking so long?""

&gt;$ME: ""The backups, I don't have a NAS here, so I can only really back up 1 or 2 machines at a time.""

&gt;$AO: ""Well what about the machines that don't need backups?""

&gt;$ME: ""I've been backing them up just in case, it's saved my ass too many times to not back them up.""

&gt;$AO: ""I don't care. We are way behind schedule, I need you to only back up the machines that say they need to be backed up.""

&gt;$ME: ""Ok, fine.""

# Act 2: Enter the fool

So now I have about 15 computers in my store that need to have windows reinstalled when a customer walks through the door. This is somewhat rare because that store probably only saw 2-5 customers a day.

&gt;$ME: ""Hi, how can I help you?""

&gt;$CX: ""I was hoping that I could get a Format and Reload""

&gt;$ME: ""Oh ok, are you sure you want a format and reload?""

It should be noted at this point that there is a sign above me that says what services we offer and format and reload basically says ""We reinstall windows on your computer""

&gt;$CX: ""Yeah, I want that.""

&gt;$ME: ""Oh ok, do you want your data backed up, or have you already done that?""

&gt;$CX: ""Oh I've backed up all my data so don't worry about that.""

&gt;$ME: ""Alright, sounds great, I'll get right on that.""

Since this was a customer at my store I decided to have his computer be the next available one, which lucky for him wasn't too long afterwards. I quickly went to work on reinstalling windows. I called him mid day the next day informing him that all the updates were done and his machine was ready. He was at work and informed me that he would pick it up that night.

#Act 3: Houston we have failure

I come into work the next morning to see him holding his computer outside the store door. _Ugh great, it's too early for this shit_ I disable the alarm and go around and open the front door.

&gt;$ME: ""Can I help you?""

&gt;$CX: ""What did you do to my computer?""

&gt;$ME: ""Is it not booting?""

&gt;$CX: ""When you pull it up nothing's there.""

Oh ok, probably just booted to a black screen for the first time. I swap another computer's spot real quick to see if it boots. Pulls up fine. Probably no big deal. Right?

&gt;$ME: ""It looks like it pulls up fine to me. Was it doing this before?""

&gt;$CX: ""None of my stuff is there.""

&gt;$ME: ""You asked for a format and reload.""

&gt;$CX: ""Yeah, so where is my stuff""

&gt;$ME: ""It got removed when I reinstalled windows.""

&gt;$CX: ""Why would you do that? I just wanted you to remove the viruses""

&gt;$ME: ""Because you asked for a format and reload. It says on the sign that we reinstall windows on that. If you look further up the sign you could ask for a tune-up or malware removal and that would have gotten rid of the viruses for you.""

&gt;$CX: ""Well, get my stuff back.""

&gt;$ME: ""Ok, well you mentioned you had a backup. Do you have it on a external drive or is it online?""

&gt;$CX: ""Oh I can get that.""

Proceeds to open up My Documents.

&gt;$CX: ""It's gone!""

&gt;$ME: ""Yeah, do you have it on like a flashdrive or on an external hard drive? Or do you have a backup service?""

&gt;$CX: ""No, you have to get it back. There's 4 years of my quickbooks data on there and the deadline for taxes is next week!""

&gt;$ME: ""I'll see what I can do.""

#Epilogue

In the end I tried running some recovery programs on the drive, but never was able to find his quickbooks data. I did get one phone call from the owner though.

&gt;$AO: ""I have a customer calling saying you lost all of his data!""

&gt;$ME: ""Yeah, the customer asked for a format and reload, and didn't want the data restored.""

&gt;$AO: ""Why didn't you back it up?""

&gt;$ME: ""Because you told me not to because it was taking too long, remember?""

&gt;$AO: ""Well, he's writing bad reviews on facebook, make sure this never happens again.""

680,It Doesn't Work,"Backstory: I'm the lead software developers at a marketing company of around 150 employees.  We haven't always had someone on tech support so when people had issues with computers they just came to me and my developers because ""we know computers"".  

The printer problem:  Printers suck, we put a man on the moon and printers never just work.  I consider it a form of job security for anyone technical.  But our printer wasn't working and they were going to throw it away.  My team didn't have a printer so I said ""We'll take a look at it and if we get it to work we'll just use it"".   We were met with some criticism for taking up this task.  The CEO of the company and one of our lead marketers.  They almost chanted for an hour straight ""It doesn't work"" and we were also laughed in our face saying ""You think you can do that"".  The game was afoot.

Upon looking at the printer's setup it wasn't connected to the network.... so we did the logical thing and connected it to the network.  After doing this we found that we could not connect directly to the IP no matter what protocol was selected.  Because printers.  So I did the next logical step and installed the driver from online.  I then connected to the printer and printed the now infamous phrase in the office: ""It Doesn't Work.""  I proceeded to bring the printer back into the CEOs office and laid the freshly printed warm paper and let him know we actually didn't need a printer for our team.

681,Headset Usage Problem,"Hi folks,

obligatory ""long time lurker, first time poster yada yada""

I'm a system administrator, mostly storage and virtualization but since we only have one 1st tier helpdesk technician my colleagues and I also do 2nd tier helpdesk.

So this happened yesterday. I get a notification about a new ticket titled ""headphone usage problem"". Check who created it and instantly facepalm. 

Background info, our executive board consists of 4 people and they share 2 secretaries. In their infinite wisdom they deciced to get rid of both secretaries at the same time and hire two complete new assistants (their terminology). 
That was two month ago. Obviously those two month were filled with tickets, mails and phone calls á la ""who's responsible for ..."", ""how do you....."" and so on. I really tried to give them the benefit of doubt because they were both new but after a month I just dubbed them ""dumb and dumbr"" and just try not to break my desk with my head.
Our telephone system is VoIP and since we also have an in-house customer callcenter we also have client software on our computers for extended features. If you're not a callcenter agent you don't really need it but it has some features people like to use e.g. copy a telephone number from an e-mail and paste it in the client to dial.

So the ticket reads:
Hello,
it is with regret that I have to inform you, that I can no longer use my headset. Everytime I dial a phone number using the phone software it phones out from ext$2 which belongs to my colleague instead of ext$1 which is mine. Instead I have to cumbersomely use the keyboard on the phone to dial. Immediate assistance ist required.
Sincerely dumb€r

1st thought:
What does that have to do with the headset?
2nd thought:
What's cumbersome about using the bloody dialpad on the phone?
3rd thought:
Oh man, I bet dumber is using dumbs extension to log into the client software.

So I reply:
Hello dumb€r,
What number do you input into the program when you open it?
 (Please note the absence of any technical terms as to not overload dumbers brain)

Instead of an reply in the ticket I get a phone call.

dumb€r: (long winded repeat of everything in  the ticket)

Me: Yes, yes but what number do ..

dumb€r interrupts: (another repition)

Me: I understand but what num..

dumb€r interrupts: (another repition with interjected ""I can't work like this, nothing works"")

Me interrupts: Do you mind if I log on remotely?

dumb€r: Not at all (gives me ID and password)

I log on and check the number she's using and of course she's using ext$2 instead of her own ext$1. I log her off and try to log her in with ext$1. An error pops up ""You're allready logged in"" 

Me: Huh?

dumb€r: I tried that but it gave me the same error. So I tried to trick it by putting ext$1 as the password.

Me(facepalm): It wouldn't log you in so you tried to trick the program by using ext$1 as the password for ext$2?

dumb€r: Yes, but it is still not working. Why doesn't it work?

Me: Well, it's not working because you're using the wrong login and you can't use the right login because someone else is using it.

Long story short, I went up to the top floor checked both their logins and just as I thought dumb was using dumbers extension. Logged both of them off and told them to use the right numbers to log in.

Exhibit A: outdated passwords on the documentation they handed over. Exhibit B: OUIs missing from the switches they deployed shortly before we took them over. (*That* particular problem I have seen enough times it's my first go-to for a phone not working.)  
Exhibit C: Their domain. It's not contoso.int but it might as well be with how badly it's named.  
I was on the PDC looking for a mapped drive setting. No GPOs for it, so perhaps a script? So I tried pulling up \\\contoso.int to get to the Sysvol folder.  
Nada. Timed out. On the PDC. And ping turned up 172.16.1.5, which wasn't responding and had no ARP entry.  
So of course, as my favorite shirt declares, it's DNS.  
They had old/nonfunctional nameservers out the wazoo, some dating back years. Plus the secondary DC was missing in spots. I tidied up the records and cleared the caches, then switched back to cmd. Nslookup gave me the right response!....but ping didn't. Even after multiple courtesy flushes.  
I was still thinking it was a latency issue. But a nagging bit of doubt after working on desktops doing the same thing pointed me to the hosts file.  
And there. it. was.  
&gt;172.16.1.5      contoso.int  

Deleted the entry and everything came up fine.  
And the scripts I was looking for were there but unapplied. So I still have no idea how their drives are getting mapped besides manually.

The network has gone down in half of the school we need it up and running now. 

1st line had done the usual are all the lights on in the switches ect. 

This school had had several network issues so I got sent to investigate. The visit went like this:

I arrive and go to the switch cabinet at that side of the school where I see 8 empty plug sockets and a laminator plugged in and the switch plug laying on the counter. I promptly plug it back in and low and behold problem solved. I moved the laminator and put a sign covering the switch plug saying do not unplug. I inform the school what had happened and leave. 

The next day I receive a frantic call stating the network was down again. I ask them to check the plug and am assured that it is plugged in and that, that is not the issue. 

So I head to the school go to the cabinet and see it is back to the laminator being plugged in and the switch unplugged. I carry out the same procedure and take the IT link there to show them and tell them that they need to check this before calling. All is well and IT link is happy. 

The next day guess what? Another call about the network being down. Speak to IT link and he assured me he has checked the plug and that is 100% not the issue. I begrudgingly go back to the school and discover that it has been unplugged again. At this point I had, had enough. I went and found the headteacher and IT link and had the following conversation:
Me: someone keeps unplugging the switch causing your network to keep dropping, this is the third time this week and it’s starting to cost you a lot of money; £75 a visit to put a plug back in the wall.

685,Logging onto Windows with a different username STILL doesn't change your username on a 3rd party website.,"One of the applications we use requires a browser plugin. From time to time this plugin fails and has to be reinstalled - a process which usually involves much manual editing of the registry and hunting down configuration files for termination. Occasionally things are so messed up it is quicker and easier to reimage the machine and start over: the plugin configures itself under each individual user's profile and, on a shared computer, there can be dozens of profiles. From time to time I see the plugin working under some profiles but not others, hence the rewipe because I don't feel like going through each individual profile and making the fixes.

One of the profiles is kiosk mode which is pretty locked down. You can use the third party application and not much else - it hobbles the user to an extent, but when their regular profile is borked it will get the job done until I pull the machine to wipe. So I tell the user to log in under the kiosk account and they're good to go.

Users frequently believe that when they log in under username: kiosk their username on the third party site *also* changes to username: kiosk. I then get another call saying they can't log in to the 3rd party site.

$user: kiosk - that's what you told me to log in with

$me: no, that's the account to log onto Windows. Your 3rd party username is unchanged

BONUS: Many users repeatedly, as in every three months, believe that when the 3rd party site forces them to change their password EVERY other password is changed along with it - local computer, email, payroll, I haven't seen anybody think their bank account password changes yet, but give it time.

689,User disability causes an unexpected problem,"As with most tech people, I am my parents' personal tech support line. My dad is legally blind, so most of the things he needs assistance with are related to not being able to see well. His vision is 20/200- his vision is mostly a big blur, but he can read if he holds the text up to within a few inches of his face. Glasses do not help his vision.

A few years ago he got his first smartphone (an iphone). He quickly learned his way around using Siri and the text-to-voice features, and had the font size on his phone set to approx 100px which made it possible for him to read it. 

Within his first few weeks with his new phone, he asked me for help with a weird problem. He told me that every time he tried to call his office's voicemail to check his messages, when he tried to type in his password, the screen would go black on him. I took his phone and tried checking the voicemail, and it worked fine. I couldn't reproduce the issue with his screen going black. Feeling stumped, I told him to do it himself so I could see what he was doing.

My dad dialed his office voicemail number and put the phone to his ear. The message prompted him to enter his mailbox password. He took the phone and held it in front of his face, one inch away from his eyes, while his pointer finger reached to press the number pad. The screen went black. That's when I realized, he was holding the phone so close to his face that it was triggering the proximity sensor (which makes the screen going black the way it does when you hold it up to your ear during a call). 

When I told him the problem, he adjusted to hold the phone far enough away to not make the screen go black. Since then he's been super happy with his iphone.

690,Words failed me.,"I'm not proper tech support but since I started with this small company at entry level customer service, I've proven to be enough of a self-starter to get promoted several times to somewhat of a data analyst/client reporting master/basic coding resource and I'm often backup IT/Tech support for a lot of the team. 


In any case, I had developed some automation of menial work that also allowed for some helpful data points and trends to be displayed on a user-friendly dashboard on the fly out of my own desire to see what I could do.  The CEO found out about this project and asked me to deploy it to one of the directors (Director, for now).  Once I walked Director through how it all worked, there was one aspect that she requested that needed some work; fixing this required my collaboration with a developer currently on an extended vacation.  No big deal; I was able to devise and document a set of something like 7-10 steps that would work fine until it was fully automated. 


This particular Director was, of course, not great with any kind of tech and really struggled with anything to do with Excel beyond simply opening a file.  I knew this would be painful for her so I took pains to type out each step complete with snips of what each step looked like, color coding, the works.  I emailed her these steps after reiterating why it was needed, that this was temporary, etc., and also included someone close to her in her office (we don't work in the same location) who I knew would be able to help her out if she couldn't reach me with issues.  Additionally, I let her know that I would be flying to her location for a week very soon and I would absolutely make time for her while in the office as she struggled a bit with following along in screen sharing. 


Fast forward, and I'm at her location.  I try to drop by her office a couple times but each time she tells me she's too busy to talk.  Okay, I guess.  On that Friday, my last day there, within my last hour, I'm in a meeting with the CEO, a couple other of execs, and a couple directors and I'm largely taking that time to field questions and discuss areas for improvement.  I'm suddenly interrupted mid-sentence by Director flinging the door open.



Director: [Me], why isn't the dashboard ready for use?? It's so important!

Me: [blinking a few times] It requires some upgrades but is functional... did you get my email outlining the steps needed?

No one mentioned what had happened but I received a delivery back at my home office the following Monday of a bottle of wine from the CEO with no explanation.


I think Director realized she was acting insane because she was able to process my instructions for a while before the promised update occurred.  She left the company not too long after that.

693,How to not use version control,"Last year I was employed as a contractor into a company that didn't really have anyone who knew how to develop. The reason I was contracted was they had a large quantity of ColdFusion code on their server.

My job was to convert this ColdFusion code to raw PHP... Kill me.

But it paid extremely well, and I really only averaged ~4 hours of work a day to satisfy my requirements.

Along with all the ColdFusion, the servers had a rule in place that allowed users to add and edit files, but no one could delete anything. So the directories were massive since there were multiple .pdf.bak.bak.bak files, and even a .txt file which was named, ""Hey Jim, next time you see this can you update [x]"".txt, which was then an empty file.

So I spent about 6 months converting everything over to PHP, setting up VC, creating a test environment, asking for feedback to make sure everything was behaving properly. And when it was all good to go, I did my final push to VC to the group name that I'll just abbreviate 'gn'.

So here the master branch is, all converted. I contact the gn manager and tell them that I've updated all their files, and that we've removed the ColdFusion from prod. A security scan is run, and it comes back spotless (go me!). For any new updates they should work with a specific coworker to push their files.

Fast forward to last week (I completed my work around June of 2017), and I get an email from my old manager asking some questions about the work I had done (I'm still with the company, just on a different project).

So I start digging. The first thing that I find is a repo on VC named 'gn-final'. So I start digging through that repo, and they've simply pulled the php files I wrote from my gn repo, and kept them next to the .cfm files that existed before we got rid of them.

Apparently they had some changes to make, and used this gn-final instead of branching from my repo, and our security guy got a lot of alerts that new critical security issues had been deployed in production. Now we have a meeting today to discuss proper deployment procedures.


tl;dr: Removed security flaws and a year later a group put the exact same flaws back into production.

Edit: Meeting just finished. Some more digging makes it look like their developer made changes in the 'gn' repo, not the 'gn-final' repo. Then when they asked for their changes in production, they used the 'gn-final' repo.

694,CEOs and their printers,"This title probably triggered a lot of people but I wanted everyone to know what they were getting into. I've dealt with a lot of printers in my experience and can usually get it working if it's not a complicated hardware repair. I've also dealt with certain CEOs being the special snowflakes who expect everything to work 24/7, and our CIO just can't say no to them.

The first tale started when my director asked if I was available to install a printer for our CFRE (Central Fund Raising Executive). Luckily I didn't have anything going on that afternoon, and the new printer was already ordered and inventoried in our stock room. We set up a time and I brought the printer over to install. I had looked at the ticket she assigned me and it simply said ""My printer is dead. I need a new one."" I look at the history, it went to Procurement, and our CIO's assistant simply ordered a new one based on our standard. No scope and assess, no checking with our team if we had any stock printers that would work. Just jump the line for this executive and forget about the budget (charging other departments for their IT equipment? What's that?). I knew this wouldn't be the end.

I bring the printer over, the CFRE isn't there as most executives want their IT work done while they're not in meetings. His assistant let me in, and the first thing I do is assess the printer since I don't have anyone watching over my shoulder. I turned it on and watched it come to life. I printed out a config sheet and supplies status page. Network configured, not low on supplies at all. I even did test printers from his computer just fine. Did the printer really just get turned off and he had no idea how to turn it on? It wouldn't surprise me. The biggest kicker is that the printer was on a service contract, and if it was actually did, there was a good chance our vendor could fix/replace it because we already paid a monthly amount for service/supplies (these were charged to departments for their printers, or were supposed to be anyway).

I decide to just replace the printer, the decision made was way above my pay grade and I knew to just do what my bosses told me to do. I get the new printer set up and functional, bring the old one back. I debate between telling my director or just not saying anything at all, and choose not to say something. Anybody in IT here who's assistant director level or above is trained to appease executives, so what would be the point?

We're a small civil engineering firm(with focus on small), and due to lack of resources new employees take more time to set 'em up, but one such employee wanted to start early, so we asked him to bring his notebook with him to set it up.

He brings his dusty Semp Toshiba notebook (which according to him some keys don't work),then he sits on the chair, lays it on the desk, lifts the screen and proceeds to boot it.

As the screen raised so did my eyebrow, there were dark red splotches all over its surface. While startled, I composed myself and began to troubleshoot:

$me: So what keys aren't working?

$NE: I don't know exactly...

$NE: (opens a browser and starts typing)

After he typed some letters, a few of them were numbers, which led me to:

$me: (presses fn + num lock buttons)

$NE: What!? What did you do? Its working now!

$me: I turned num lock off.

From what I could see he was very relieved (probably wasn't using it for quite some time thinking it was broken). Then I asked:

$me: And what are those red spots on the screen?

$NE: Those? I burst a pimple on my face and the blood splat on the screen.

$me: (internally hurls)

$me: Well, why didn't you clean it then?

$NE: Oh? I'm not really sure...

$me: Sigh... (grabs a disposable rag and some cleaning solution).

After a few wipes, the screen is crystal clear (and the rag way more gross than it was before)

I looked up the server in CMDB and it sure turned out that the IP address was changed.

Since the IP address change was the sole reason why the server lost connectivity, I asked the network guy if he could send me a full list of new IP ranges which were implemented.

His response:
&gt; It's OBVIOUS that when server is moved to a new vlan, its' IP address changes.

Well, it was not so obvious to me. And I still did not get the list of new network ranges, so I had to ask again.

1) Passive aggressive threat about the financial cost of the employee's idle time being blamed on IT. 

2) Rhetorical (from my point anyway) questions about how the new employee will spend their time now? 

3) Demands for the tracking numbers for the parts so they can track the shipping themselves. (We don't even have those yet)

4) Ad hoc employee evaluations (very negative) for my entire department and eventually myself. 

5) Dire apocalyptic prophesy about the impact on the company if not the world or human life in general  if their employee does not get their system in a few hours (bit my tongue to keep from suggesting we send a tech to re-image the customer's own similar system for the new employee to avoid this Extinction Level Event)

\[T\ being myself the technician]

\[C\ being the client]

Minding the front desk as I was filling in for another Technician, a man, and his wife walks in. They have this old Dell Inspiron which they had claimed started to run slow and on top of that couldn't run ""Candy Crunch."" I took a look at the PC after it had finally booted up. There were some updates that couldn't go through for the machine. Threw some run-time errors and explained to them that a wipe and re\-installation of the OS would more than likely remedy their issue. The one thing that truly mattered to this man was the ability to run ""candy crunch."" We go over pricing and turn around time and he agrees to leave his laptop.

Ensue the next day. I had finished the laptop after making a VHD of his HDD for a data backup, and a new OS with some of his apps. I go over some points such as ""Candy Crunch"" to make sure it was a quality job and call.

T\ ""Hello C\ I have just finished your laptop, its running quick with little hick-up, and all your updates have gone through.""

C\ ""Oh that's just fantastic, I'll swing by later today to pick up my laptop. I cant wait to play ""candy crunch"".""

T\ ""Absolutely sir we will have your laptop on the waiting rack for you to pickup.""

Time passes as I'm working with other machines and C\ finally comes in and picks up. Candy Crush was running completely fine on Google Chrome so I knew my job was complete for T\... or so I thought. I received a call thirty minutes later from C\...

C\ ""This is complete B\-. I paid you people to fix my PC so I can play my F- CANDY CRUNCH. AND I STILL CAN'T PLAY""!

T\ ""Sir I'm completely sorry, I even made sure that cand-""

C\ ""NO IT'S NOT WORKING. SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? DROP IT OFF TO HAVE YOU PEOPLE CHARGE ME AGAIN JUST TO PLAY CANDY CRUNCH. THE GAME IS FREE""!

At this point I have a hunch to the problem's solution but I also couldn't help this strange anger build up in me. I even made sure candy crush works before making the call and yet another thing; your'e not even saying the name right.

T\ ""Sir we give a 30-day service guarantee, I would be pleased to help you. Before anything else, are you in front of your PC""?

C\ ""YES""!

T\ ""Okay please open up google chrome and type speed test in the search bar.""

C\ ""fine.. I hate chrome anyways. Now what.. run it I suppose. If I knew these were your tools I'd do this work myself.""

T\ ""Well I only use this site for very specific problems, this is just to get an understanding of your network speeds to an extent and yes please run it.""

Running out of patience on my end. The test goes for about the usual 30-50 seconds.

T\ ""So how is it going.""

C\ ""Better if I could play my damn game but the thing gave me two numbers, a five and a six and a half or so.""

I took the biggest sigh off phone. I did all I could to fix C\ problem and I did fix it. But I cant fix Internet speeds...

T\ ""C\ could you please play candy crush on chrome I would like to know how it runs.""

C\ ""WHY? The Candy Crunch runs like crap on fire fox and internet Edge why would it run any better on this garbage browser""?

T\ ""Sir please try it.""

One eternity of a minute later...

C\ ""...""

The moment of pause. The sweet break in\-between deep angry breathing to a more calm state. The man had not said anything for a solid minute. The next thing I could hear is even sweeter.. the ""Candy Crunch"" theme. It played for about 15 seconds until C\ finally said something..

C\ ""..why. Why cant this run on FIREFOX""!

At this point I've had enough and I did what technicians should never. I had to do it to em' with facts. Told him that his internet barely has enough to even load the game let alone play it on other browsers and that potentially Chrome was the better browser due to the fact that it ""optimized"" the game over the rest of the ads on Facebook. I told him how the computer now runs without any issues and that he should honestly call his ISP for a better package that way ""Candy Crunch"" will play flawlessly on any browser from anywhere in his house. At that point He had enough and just agreed and went to go call his ISP.  Later when the day was over I sat in my car for a solid minute just thinking to myself ""Google Chrome is better optimized to play Candy Crunch."" I never would have or ever wanted to say something that dumb in my life, let alone say it to calm someone in a candy crunch induced rage.

&gt; Good morning $rmacd [smiley emoticon]

Not now it effing isn't.

I struggle; the most laboured of replies is formulated over many minutes:

&gt; Hi...


Now there is one - and only one - reason I'd be getting a message from $1LS. Something is broken and - invariably - it's easier to just leave the ticket in the queue and ask me the question when I get in, than read the documentation I've literally spent ~~hours~~ days writing. F me. Here goes.

&gt; $1LS: We have been trying to make $routine_change and $maint and I can't compile your code

&gt; $rmacd: ...

&gt; $1LS: It doesn't work

&gt; $rmacd: ... I mean, ok - I get that ""doesn't compile"" == ""won't work"", but you gotta give me something to work on here ... What was the error? Where are the logs?


Now just a quick bit of background, we were mainly a Java outfit at this point. All our support (offshore) were contracted solely as JEE support techs. That is literally part of their job description (this becomes important). 


The application? Entirely orthodox: a JEE application about as old as humanity itself and one which would bite you in the arse and send you into an apocalyptic wild goose chase if you as much as blinked when it was looking at you. Younger me - being the budding and ~~naive~~ enthusiastic young programmer I was, offered to try tidy it up a bit - add some logging, mavenize for some dependency management and packaging ... etc. But of course, as happens, this only serves to catalyze the process by which I eventually turn into the sole point of contact for the application.


But yes. Logs. In fact I was very proud of the logging. So much so, I remember specifically, _excitedly_ writing in the system documentation that as long as `TERM=1` it would give you some beautifully colorized logs. The thinking being, that even if you were on the lower end of the scale of ""0"" thru ""unable to read instructions"", you would still clearly see any bright red lines angrily hissing ""ERROR"" at you and, you know ... fix them.


Or so I thought.


&gt; $rmacd: Have you sent the logs through yet?

&gt; $maint/$1LS: Sent now, please do the needful [sic] [smiling emoticon]


wtf is this


&gt; $rmacd: Did you mean to send me through a screenshot of your desktop?

&gt; $maint: Logs are in the bottom [smiling emoticon]


Yes. I can see your desktop, Eclipse and the bottom console showing about 2 lines from stdout. I don't even.


&gt; $rmacd: Can you send me through the application logs please? 

&gt; $maint: Yes sure sir

Now I don't know if you've got these points in your life where it feels like everything froze and you still recall precisely everything about your surroundings, what you were doing, who you were with. Mostly associated with traumatic events.


This was one of those events.


Not only has $maint sent me another screenshot but - clear as day - in my beautiful, colorized output, in bright red, right in the middle of his screen:

$me= ok, so $ca, did you put this into the address bar or did you do like a google search for it?

$ca = I put it in the address bar

$me = that is odd, how about I remote into your computer to help you out. In order to do so, I would need you to click on a link that I can send to the e\-mail address that we have on file.

$ca = no that is on my phone, not on the computer. I have a different e\-mail on the computer 

$me = … k… can you go to $\(mail provider’s website\), and log in that way? I can only send it to an e\-mail on file, due to privacy and FERPA guidelines.

$ca = no. That e\-mail is on my PHONE, this other e\-mail is on the COMPUTER.

$me = ok… what is the “computer e\-mail”

$ca = \*\*reads same e\-mail but with a number 2 at the end. $ca made a new e\-mail for every device they had\*\*

$me = ok, \*\*\*adds alt e\-mail so I can send it to that one\*\*\* click this link, I will use $remoteprogram to help

$me = ok, so you see how you typed this into the Bing \*shudder\* “search field”, don’t do that, just do it in the address bar  \*shows the difference between the two\*

$ca = They. Are. The. Same. Thing.

$me = … so when I type it in you see how it gets you to where I want to go?

$ca = that is because you are doing it on your computer, MINE goes to the other thing. Ya’ll need to learn how to help people, because you can do that with your IT access, I don’t have the same permissions on the internet that you do!

$me = …k…  \*\*clicks links to get to password reset pages\*\* so just fill this out and you will be good to go.

701,We don't know where this script is coming from!,"This happened over the course of the past week, and finally ended today.

The Characters:

$Me: The only programmer at the company

$Supe: My somewhat tech-savvy supervisor

$AdGuy: A PPC ad guy, who also does SEO and other analytics-related stuff.  For those who remember my previous story, yes, this is $NewGuy.

One week ago, $Supe approaches me.

&gt; $Supe: Hi, you're going to hate me for this.

&gt; $Me: Okayyyy, what's up?

&gt; $Supe: We have an analytics script on CompanySite that we can't find the source of.  We used to add this script via TagManager, but that was giving us duplicate stats.  We know the script is working, because we're still receiving the stats.  We had an outside guy try to find this a while back, but he couldn't find anything.  $AdGuy needs to make sure that this script only sends anonymized IP data, to be compliant with GDPR, so this is very important.

&gt; $Me: Do you have any other information?

&gt; $Supe: Nope.

So I proceed to grep the entire server for this script.  I cant find it or any reference to it, except in cached pages.  I go back to $Supe.

&gt; $Me: So the script isn't on the server.  This most likely means that it's being inserted by an outside service.  Can you think of any service that you might have set up that you're not using anymore?

&gt; $Supe: Nope.

Great.  So the next day, I visit every analytics and code insertion service that I know the company uses, and check each one.  Nothing.  Then I try MetalBrowser's tools, and discover that the pageview request URL created by this script already contains a directive to anonymize the IP address.  Awesome, right?  I relay this information to $Supe, but he tells me to keep looking because he still doesn't want scripts with unknown sources running on CompanySite.

I proceed to bang my head on this for a couple more days.  Then I hit on the idea of loading CompanySite incrementally, so I can see when this script appears, and hopefully what adds it.

Today, I load the page incrementally.  The analytics script has already appeared at the first breakpoint.  There's only one other script loaded, something with a gibberish file name.  I open it up in the sources tab, and it says...CumulusFire?  The load balancer?  Why would that insert an analytics script?  I open up the company's CumulusFire account, and see a link to something called ""Apps"".  And there's an analytics app installed.  I uninstall it, and reactivate the script in TagManager.  Five minutes later, $Supe arrives in the office.

&gt; $Me: I found the source of the script, apparently someone installed it via CumulusFire.

&gt; $Supe: Oh, right, I forgot we'd done that!

So I'm informed (days late, mind you) that big Mr. Swingin' D. McImportantPerson has transferred here from one of our offices in another country and needs a cell phone.

I have everything ready to go, and the order confirmations go out. Immediately Mr. McImportantPerson forwards one of the emails to me, asking:

*""(Phone Model)? Really? Is there a war on or something over here? Do you people really not know they have released (DesiredModel) now?""*

704,"A shouting mob, tears and a wookie roar.","Last year, we migrated to Windows 10.

It did not go well.

About half way through my migration schedule, I had to do an office of old ladies that were very resistant to change in all ways. They were in an uproar when the menu at their favorite lunch spot was updated. All new computers and a new operating system would be extra fun for me.

Side Note: My coworker and I listed out all the problem offices/users and divided them up so we both got an equal amount of problem users.

On the day the migration was scheduled, I showed up to their office at the scheduled time. They were of course not ready for me. No backups done, matter of fact they were still working as if nothing was going on. They received no less than 5 general emails and each received a calendar invite with clear instructions, and the date and time of the migration. They chose to \(unsurprisingly\) ignore them.

When I showed up to do the migration I was ganged up on and told what a terrible person I am for changing things on them.

\&gt;How dare I disrupt their important work with this?

\&gt;Can’t they have an exception?

\&gt;We are still getting used to Windows 7!

\&gt;Come back later, we are busy!

\&gt;You don’t have my permission to touch my computer!

I politely explain to them that this was put out in multiple meetings, by email and the flashing reminders that just popped up on their screens reminding them that this was happening. I politely ask them to pull up the email from the CEO stating that this is mandatory and all exceptions will have to be submitted in writing 2 weeks ago. I explain that I am doing my job and if they refuse this migration, I will lock their computers out until the migration has been completed.

They continue to refuse to allow me access to their computers.

At this point I am tired of going in circles with them and calmly walk of the office and return to mine. Once at my desk, I lock their computers in AD and send a remote restart. Their computers are now locked out. Within 5 minutes, they all storm into my office hurling insults, accusations and one is begging me to give her an exception. I repeat my speech about this being mandatory and I do not have the power to exempt anyone, even the scheduling of this was out of my hands.

Once again tired of going in circles with them, I call the CEO directly. He backs my actions and orders them to allow me access.

I return to their office to perform the migration. Taking the CEO’s suggestion, I recommend the ladies go take a coffee break and come back in 30 minutes. I back up the user data, swap the computers with new hardware and restore their profiles to the new computers. Task complete!

It wasn’t.

For anyone who reads these stories, we all know this isn’t where it ends.

About the time that the ladies were finished taking their hour long 30 minute break, it is time for lunch. I make a point of taking a full hour away from my desk each day at a set time whenever possible. I sit on a bench outside, reading a book. I find this helps me recenter myself. My users \(generally\) know that I am to be left alone during this time. I become surly when I do not have my midday break.

The ladies weren’t having it. About 15 minutes into my lunch, they all came storming out to where I sit, foaming at the mouth and hurling abuse even before they were close enough for me to understand them. When the mob finally gets to my bench, I remind them I am on lunch and would be back in my office in 45 minutes.

\&gt;How dare I take a lunch break when they are having computer issues!

I know that they will continue to mob me until I relent. Normally, I do not allow my lunch to be interrupted, but I know this will only be made worse if I do not go now. We proceed to their office and I ask what the issue is. Immediately I am overwhelmed by the most basic of issues.

\&gt;How do I log in?

\&gt;Where is all my apps?

Three of the four ladies are yelling at me, the fourth is sobbing quietly at her desk. She tells me that this is all too much change and maybe she should just retire. I know what needs to be done.

I give the loudest Wookie roar I can \(my throat was sore for a bit after\) to get their attention. The yelling stops, the room is silent but for some muffled sobs and all eyes are on me \(including some from people in other offices now\).

707,No you!,"This will be a short one.

**Background:**

A few years back I worked as a L1 support for a phone company. Horrible job. This is one of the stories that stuck with me.

**Story:**

It was around noon when $C [customer] called. He had heard about our offer where he could call *one* other phone number for free. As such, he had bought that service.


The customer is required to log in to their account and input the number manually, after which it will be free to call that number, as long as you hang up before the 2 hour mark. Calling the same number, within seconds of hanging up, was allowed.


The issue $C had, was that he was getting billed for calling this number and he wanted to know why. I quickly recalled the 2 hour rule and went to check; all of his calls were less than 2 hours. Good boy. So I went to check the number he had provided for the service. Guess what, the last numeral was wrong. I told him this. He refuted having made a mistake and demanded a full refund. I told him I could see in the logs, down to the exact second, when he input the number and his IP at that time.


His reaction? Blaming me (personally) for changing the number after he had input it, because he knew he didn't make a mistake. I told him that even if I sympathized with him, the amount he demanded refunded was way above what I was allowed to refund, so I couldn't refund him even if I wanted to.


This unleashed another storm of slurs and personal critique; something along the lines of being a liar, corrupt, incompetent, etc.

Luckily, the company policy allowed us to hang up on customer if they verbally attack us, so I did.

I wanted to make this last story special and memorable, for myself mostly. This community is one of my favourite on Reddit, and the levels of camaraderie I've experienced here is unmatched. We can all let off some steam by blasting our customers and end users in a safe space, and I truly believe it helps us all in our careers. We share a common perspective, and unlike my most other aspects of my life, I feel like I belong here. This is why I present to you the story of TerrorByte. It's heavily modified from actual events, which may be difficult to pick up on, but I included a TL:DR at the bottom anyway. Please excuse any horrible formatting, it's 6AM here, and I've not slept!

_Our story begins long ago. Our hero, a pokey startup, forms a cloud, the glint in their eyes and the fire in their heart paving the way for great things. The \~\~spice\~\~ data flows, and they expand with rapid efficiency, quickly surpassing 1 exabyte of storage. The number continues to rise, and constant improvements, monitoring, and preemptive problem solving result in years without a single data loss event. The world felt.. balanced._

_I'm afraid, however, this plot is not without strife. The storage repositories, although 80TB in size, were no match for the sheer mass of a JBOD full of raw 4K footage. Will the unlimited storage policy be the folly of our hero?_

TerrorByte, our villan, hatches his evil plan to find the limit of 'unlimited', and ponders in his lair, becoming excited at the potential reward for his success, elite status in the league of evil end-users. 

""Muahaha, if only I can find their limit. They cannot possibly be infinite. I shall find their weakness, and bamboozle them into oblivion!""

His mind set, he begins the upload of his 4k footage. To his misfortune, EOL (Evil Online) provides only ADSL broadband, with only moderate upload speeds! *gasp* - He waits. His beard grows, the wallpaper peels from the walls, and dust begins to coat his lair. TerrorByte remains at his console, waiting for the right moment. Time passes.

""Let us check our progress! Muahah.""

""Nooooooooo. Those incompetent fools!""

TerrorByte phones our hero's cloud support team, and furiously demands that they resolve the ridiculous speed issues to their system. Support are sympathetic, however ultimately, they explain to him the implications of such a large upload, and also the logic of attempting to store 80TB of data in the cloud. They also indicate that while they offer unlimited storage, there are limitations to the infrastr-- _**click**_

He hangs up the phone, repressing the interaction lest it damage his pride, or his evil doings. He continues to upload, and brood. 

After some time, TerrorByte falls into a catatonic state. His lifeless body awaits the siren's call. 

Seasons pass, times change, wars come and go, but TerrorByte remains with a sole purpose, to overload the cloud. His resolute nature drives him to continue living, until the day he can report his success!

""Wat."" TerrorByte stumbles back, unable to contain his fury. ""What is tHe MeAnInG oF THIS!!"" 

He slams his fists down onto his console, and immediately picks up the phone to contact support. However, not wanting to let on his evil intentions, he plays it cool. 

""Hello, this is Cloud Support, how can I help?"", said the employee on the other end. 

""Oh, hai. Yes, I, erm, just wondered if you could check my account, to make sure there aren't any... _problems_ with it? I'm storing a lot of data and it would be a shame if something....._happened_ to it."" He struggles to absorb a snigger. 

""Oh, wow, I see you're storing 79TB. That is a lot for cloud storage, and I would seriously recommend against continuing to upload. Our repositories are only 80TB, and this is something I'll need to bring to the attention of management, as you could encounter data loss if it becomes full.""

""No, no."" said TerrorByte, ""I can go ahead and remove some data, there's no need to take it any further. In fact, I'll get right on that now.""

""Okay sir, good luck, and let us know if you have any problems.""

""Oh, I will. ^^muahahahahahahaha"" _**click**_

TerrorByte regroups for a last push. He makes copies of existing data, and begins a further upload. This time, there shall be no sleep. His eyes would be glued to the console for the duration of the transfer.

709,"Well, we wanted to test that anyway ...","Some time ago I was part of a team who built a datacenter. A final step of the project was a long list of tests where we would verify that

* if a redundant component fails there will be no service disruption
* monitoring alerts actually work

So we created a long list of tests. While preparing that list I noticed that one host reported one power supply as faulty. Well... we'll check that when we are onsite.

So there are about 10 people in this server room... network guys, storage guys, virtualization guys, quality manager. We are doing one test at a time... unplug something... verify its still working... check monitoring. Plug back in... verify its still working... check monitoring. Unplug the other cable... etc.

I mentioned the problem with the power supply so we check.. hmmm both show 'green' but hardware monitoring reports one as faulty. Strange.

While we are doing redundancy tests suddenly the host with the faulty power supply fails. I look up - and there's a networking guy holding a power cable....

Me: 'Explain ?'

NG: 'Uh.. I wanted to see if its properly seated...'

Me: 'Well... seems that was the cable to the operational power supply... and we wanted to test host failover anyway.'

Somehow unplugging and re-inserting the faulty power supply fixed it.

And host failover worked (VMware vSphere HA usually does).

And we noticed monitoring didn't monitor host network connections and fixed that.

EDIT: Actually we found another thing that was kind of interesting. Well at least for me because I hadn't thought of it when preparing the test checklist.

When we did network switch redundancy test (pull power cable from switch) connected ESXi hosts would fail over traffic to the other switch; almost no packets lost. Good.

But when the switch was powered back on network traffic to ESXi hosts would be disrupted for almost one minute. Bad. What happened was that network ports to ESXi hosts would come up, ESXi would distribute traffic between switches, but the switch that just had been powered on wouldn't talk to other switches for some time. Don't ask me why; I can 'sho run' and 'copy run start' but thats it. So they implemented a delay when the ESXi network ports would come up. If we had tested this by just shutting down ports on the switch we wouldn't have caught this.",False,323,17,wrdlbrmft,talesfromtechsupport

715,Just because lights are on does not mean it’s getting power,"Pre-text: I am not your typical tech support. I am an electrical engineer specializing in induction furnaces. These are the items that melt metals down to liquid for pouring into molds. 

So this week I’m in Chicago, headed home after solving a problem and learning an important lesson. Just because lights are on, does not mean the unit is receiving power. 

Tuesday I get an emergency call around 2 pm est. A client in Chicago area is down and wants me out there yesterday. Before I go, I go to our aftermarket sales and ask “Does client X have all the spare parts I would need?”  Yup. They do. Awesome. 

I fly out that night and get there in the morning. Now before I go further, I need to give some background. Our power supplies use a proprietary unit that I can’t name without revealing my company. Let’s just call it PSPLC. Because that’s what it is. It is a proprietary PLC designed to watch, control, and fire thyristors up to 1.2 MHz. We can’t use a standard PLC as it’s refresh rates are not fast enough. To give you an idea, this particular unit was designed in the early 90s. 

So I get in Tuesday morning and discover the problem is that the PSPLC is not working. It doesn’t start. At all. The unit powers up. Gives a quick BUS Error. Then goes into another language saying what translates to Self Test. 

Nice. We’ll Bus error would mean that one or more of PSPLC cards aren’t communicating. We will start there. I have the client grab all his spares and I replace these cards one by one into the rack. No change. Spare CPU, spare IO cards, spare rectifier and inverter cards. No change. Ok. It has to be the rack then. 

They don’t have a spare rack. Fuck. 

We don’t have a rack in stock. Double fuck. 

We have a backplane in stock. Bingo. It has the wrong transformers, but hey, my colleagues can solder and make it work.  They do that and ship it out next day. I get to go to the hotel and wait for it to arrive the next day. Awesome, an afternoon off. I’m convinced it’s the backplane. After all, it’s the only thing that hasn’t been changed and it’s the pathway between the cards. Maybe a trace blew. I’ve seen it before. This will make for an extra day maybe, but I should still be home in time for my family event this weekend. 

I go in Thursday morning and the parts there at roughly 8 am. Perfect. We take the rack out and replace the backplane. Install the original cards. Takes 2 hours but by 10 AM we’re ready for a power test. The unthinkable happens. Same error. Fuuuuuuuu

I get out my laptop and plug in my usb to 232 converter and my null modem cable. I disconnect the customer interface module and connect manually to the PSPLC. I open up DOS. Yes. DOS. In 2018. Remember how I said this was designed in the early 90s?

I type in the command to connect. I connect. Yay. Immediately see “BUS Time out... error 016.019.001”.

Ok so more information. I look up in our manuals and it tells me nothing I don’t know. It’s a Error with cards communicating to each other. Ok. 016 is the error number. Troubleshooting guide says to replace all the cards one by one. If not, replace the rack. Great. Already did that. 019 means it’s a problem with the inverter card for inverter 2.

Wait. 

This is a single PS and furnace unit. It doesn’t have an inverter 2.

What?

I check the jumpers on the backplane. It’s set up for our standard one ps and one furnace combination. 

Maybe the error log can give me some more information. I use the DOS commands to upload the error log from the PSPLC to my computer. I then use the command to load it into a notepad file. I open it up and...

Gibberish. 

Fucking Gibberish. 

What?

At my wits end, I call my colleagues who also do this. They have no idea what could cause this. I have done everything they would have. Not only that, but Jake (name changed for anonymity) tested the backplane in our simulator yesterday and it worked there. 

Together we grasp at straws. They give me a few ideas and I get back to the unit.

I take their spare cards one by one replacing them with the new backplane. Maybe they both went at the same time? This time each time connecting with my laptop. Bus timeout. 016.019.001. Every damn time. 

I grab extra cards from other units. They won’t be able to run with these cards, but they should be able to get past the error. 016.019.001. Every. Damn. Card. 

Maybe the units not grounded correctly. I grab a meter. Nope. Both the rack and the backplane measure shorted to ground. 

Maybe the unit has external issues. Reaching, but if it eliminates the possibility, I’ll try it. I disconnect every IO connection besides the input power and my laptop. Same. Fucking. Error. 

I recheck the jumpers in back and remove the sub print board that’s for the second rectifier. It has no effect on coms, but I’m already grasping at straws. Same. Error. 

At this point I email my colleagues and boss. I call my boss up and tell him everything I’ve done. Even he’s out of ideas. He forwards my email to his superiors and instructs me to put all the spare cards in at the same time. Effectively building them a new PSPLC.

I do. And to no surprise I’m greeted with the same error. I call him back and he authorizes my colleagues to send a complete PSPLC from scratch. A $40,000 unit. Damn. 

I go to the client. I have no answers to give him. But it’s the end of the day Thursday. I have to make it back for my event Saturday. I tell the second shift manager my situation and he can’t make that call. His boss told him I don’t leave til it’s fixed. I tell my boss and he has me come in Friday and plan the last flight for Friday. I’ll be home for Saturday and he’s flying Jake out to replace me. Nice. I don’t like leaving without fixing a problem though. Always makes me feel horrible. 

I schedule my flight out for 6:30 PM. I go in at 7 AM and talk to the maintenance managers boss. I tell him the plan and he’s surprisingly ok with it. The tracking for the PSPLC indicates 9 am arrival. Awesome. I wait around a couple hours and it’s in maintenance at 10. Ok. Running late.

It’s our simulator PSPLC. I am cracking up. Every card has SIM and Property of (our company) written on it. Whatever. Atleast I know that this PSPLC works and has worked for months. 

We install it into the unit. The only wires I hook up are the 120V control power input, ground wire, and my PC. I turn it on. 

Same. Damn. Error. 

I call up Jake. “It just worked in the office yesterday! I made it!”

What haven’t I done? How do I go through 4 CPUs, 3 racks, and 4 sets of other cards and none work?

Everyone’s at a loss. It’s 11 am and I have their maintenance personnel grab a spare interface module. I don’t think it’s the interface. I’ve used 2 different cables and a Customer interface and my laptop, but it’s the only thing we haven’t done and I can keep him working while I think of another explanation. 

Then it hits me. The control power. Sure, the normal PLC powers. And the control power everywhere else works. But it’s the only common point I haven’t checked. 

I grab my meter and measure the control power directly into the PSPLC. 75VAC. 

Boom. 

Enough to turn on the rail and the unit. Not enough to function. I laugh. It’s 11 AM. I have to leave at 3. Jake’s Flight is in half an hour. I go to the client and tell him I found it. He laughs. He still wants jake to come out. If only to test all the spare parts to make sure they’re all good. 

Now the fun part. Why is control power 120 every where else but not here?

I get the drawing out. It’s from another division of our company in a different country. But I can read it. I trace it back and see that the PSPLC has its own transformer. It has its own dedicated 120V stepdown transformer. What? Who’s idea was this? Why?  I’ve never seen this in all our other units. I call Jake and our other techs. They’ve never seen it either. 

Whatever. I measure the high voltage just in case. The transformer is getting the 440V input it should be. It’s just outputting 75V. 

We talk to the parts guys and see if they have it in stock. It’s noon by the time we find out. They do! There is a god! (maybe.)

Maintenance grabs the spare and replaces the transformer. We turn it on and confirm it outputs 122V. Perfect!

It’s 1 pm. We turn hook up the unit to the PSPLC. It fucking works!

We install their rack again. It works. No errors. I’m dancing.

By 2 PM, I’m out the door. I’m driving the hour to ORD. Headed home in time for my flight, feeling the bliss of being victorious. 

I call up my boss. I tell him the news. All he asks me is “How the hell does a transformer go from putting out 120V to 75V? Either they put out 0 or the correct ratio... and who decided to give the PSPLC a dedicated transformer?”

When I tell him what division all he says is “Of course...”

716,You mean we need employees to work automated computers?,"I haven't posted in a while, but looking back over old posts \-\- I thought it would be fun to share another old story of mine.

It all starts back to when I was an hourly worker, working for the ""Little Boss^(TM)"" \(The CEO's original supervisor/manager for IT\)

I do not know where Little Boss^(TM) came from, but he was in charge of handling our servers \(Generation 8 dell I believe\), we handled data storage and network setup in the IT dept. as well as maintaining equipment that was on the office floor. Anytime new user credentials were needed, Little Boss^(TM) would have one of us do it, and give us his monthly random password to log in with his credentials.

Eventually I began to make a name for myself with Little Boss^(TM), and anything he needed done \-\- I'd be the first on the spot. Anything dealing with the servers, sensitive data backup, and lastly working on the CEO's \(AKA $BigBoss\) computer.

One thing I hadn't realized was that I wasn't being credited with any of my work, and since everything was running so smoothly, all of us in IT were sitting around \-\- tinkering with computers, fixing them when parts would arrive \(slowly building our parts stockpile\). At one point, $BigBoss determines that us sitting means cutbacks are in order. The supervisor adjusts our schedules accordingly. I was ending up working a meager 8\-16 hours, and getting a supplemental job until I could find a new main one.

After about 3 months of this, $BigBoss begins to notice more errors piling up \-\- so we're called in more and more until finally we're pulling near doubles everytime we come in.

Then, all of our services are blocked out \-\- no computer can access our main server. It can ping \-\- but for some odd reason, nothing works. I restart our workstation services to connect to the server \-\- but they're not working at all \-\- stuck loading infinitely. I use Little Boss^(TM)'s monthly random password \(which he had taped to the under side of his desk, being 20\-30 characters in length\) on the main server and find out the problem; We'd set up tasks to backup any data on a regular basis. But it was was always deleted in person to ensure copying ""sensitive data"" completed, and deleting what wasn't necessary.

Our main database storage was reading full.

I didn't understand why it was full, as any files we had could easily be compressed and take up bare nothing on it.

Little Boss^(TM) had changed the task to begin making database copies of itself on its own drive to ensure copying completed, which was no issue at first. Until it began recursively making a backup of the backup, and all files on the drive.

$BigBoss comes over and sees me working on the computer and asks very sternly ""What do you think you're doing?"", and I inform him that we'd had too much storage used. He sees me backup the old backups to long\-term storage \(and I sorted later\), delete the files, restart the server process \-\- and in no less than five minutes, screens start loading up and I feel content with life.

Apparently I'd left a big enough impression that I was put back on full time hours. While I was happy with life, my previous stories should well enough explain what I was about to get myself into.

Squatted on a static IP he figured nobody would use, outside of the DHCP pool. from a simple ipconfig, he got the gateway. He also put 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 as DNS to bypass us.

Our radius server was only used for wifi to allow users to use their domain creds to get onto the main vlan, so on wired, it was free reign. 

Anyway, when we caught up to him, we re-imaged his pc and blocked steam. We also set a bios password on all machines, and when users asked why, we said to ask Sudo Man.

He was a bit mad, and said he'll find another way around it. Was hoping it didn't come to that. See, one of the things we backed up was his excel file. The one that could render him useless (He was a  petroleum engineer btw). We told him that the machine stays the same or his boss gets a copy of it. 

We also thanked him for the internal audit, as his shenanigans got the IT manager to finally pay for a 3rd party security audit. He made the company a better place.


His name stuck though, as the girls from Procurement heard us calling him that, and followed suit, without even knowing what Sudo means.


We still keep in touch and there are no hard feelings. He took the name as a badge of honor after a while, and we appreciated what he did, as we all learned a lesson that week.

719,"The willing, and life affirming client","Working in tech support is sometimes *very* frustrating. Other times, it can really help you realize why you're in this field.

My co\-worker tells me of this server not willing to start at all, and a clueless client on the other side. The only issue is, we only support software that we put out, not hardware on the end\-user side.

I sigh, and wave at him to transfer me the call.

&gt;BxS: Hello, This is Boxed\_Singularity. How may I help you today?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Client: My server won't turn on at all, it doesn't make any noise and the fans don't come on.

My first thought at this moment was that it was a bad PSU, and I make the statement that we only support our released software, and that any hardware is not under our purview.

&gt;$Client: Then what do we pay you for?  
&gt;  
&gt;BxS: If there are any irregularities in our software, if they don't start up or anything like that \-\- then we are fully able to walk you through most problems.

By this time, the customer is pleading with me \-\- as this is one of their necessary things for their business, ties into their POS \(Point of sale\), and to their other computers. After a little, I give after I find out he's just a floor worker and not even a manager, and he's the one getting yelled at.

&gt;BxS: Alright, I want you to open up the case of the server, and I'm going to walk you through a couple of things. Now, is your server a Dell, HP, or IBM?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Client: HP. But I'm not too good with computers. Do I really have to do this? Can we just try turning it on a couple more times  
&gt;  
&gt;BxS: If there's something that's stopped it before, it'll most likely stop it the more we try. Try plugging it in somewhere else, and other than that \-\- plug a monitor up to it so you can see if it boots.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Client: I just don't know a lot, and I don't want to break anything  
&gt;  
&gt;BxS: Don't worry, with how you're already moving along \-\- you'll be a pro in no time.

I usually say that to apprehensive clients, hoping it eases them.

At this point, I figure I'll just walk him through a couple things with the PSU because that sounded like the culprit

&gt;BxS: Did that do anything when you plugged in the computer?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Client: Well, there's this light on the motherboard

Wish I'd known there was a light on this whole time, so now I walk him through taking out the ram and I ask him to turn it on \-\- listening and praying to hear beeping.

It beeps. So that's perfect, I figure it's either a bad stick, or slot \-\- so I have him plug one stick in, and it stops beeping. I have him take it out, and plug in the next one in the exact same spot, until 3 don't work there. I have him move it to the next port, and it starts to turn on. I hear him yell with excitement. 

&gt;BxS: Don't party too hard now, we're going to plug in the rest of the RAM except in the slot that isn't working.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Client: Alright, alright \- let's get this done and I thank you so much.

For a moment while he was plugging them in, I was really hoping it was just the one slot that wasn't working.

He presses the button, and it's starting up. I tell him that the board will have to be replaced in the future, but other than that it fixed the problem for now.

720,Do you not remember the psychic part of your interview?,"I don't work in tech support, but as a data processor who interacts regularly with sales people and account managers, answering some of their more...unusual questions.  



My interview for this company was a suprisingly simple one. ""Can you spot something amiss here?"" ""Can you follow these instructions?"" ""Are you able to tell what shape I've drawn on the left piece of paper in the next room?"" Pretty standard stuff.



It's a surprisingly frequent occurence to have jobs come back after they've gone to clients because they've changed their mind about something. It's almost as frequent that a sales person will come to my desk at 4:30pm asking why something's not been given to a client, when they CLEARLY asked for it...



The stars:  
$Me: Data Assassin, consumer of bagels and lacking in psychic prowess.  
$ESG (Expectant Sales Guy): Knows what they want, but not how to get it.  
$ClientManager: Only gets passing mentions, but writes the specs I work from, and makes sure it's what sales want. Patience is their virtue.



&gt; $ESG: Hey, $Me, I've looked at what went to $Client but it's missing a few things that are pretty integral to the contract.  
&gt; $Me: I don't think I missed anything, let me bring up the request and you can point out what's missing.  
  
I promptly go to the job folder and bring up the processing modules and the spec.  
  
&gt; $Me: Ok, so P1 and P2 are initial processing relating to these parts of the spec, and P3 outputs like this part of the spec says.  
&gt; $ESG: Where's the *completely unmentioned part*?  
&gt; $Me: What?  
&gt; $ESG: You've not included *completely unmentioned part*!  
&gt; $Me: Nothing I've seen mentions that once... I mean, I could look at doing it, but it's usually a day or two of work.  
&gt; $ESG: No! This has to go out today. I can't believe you've missed this out! They even confirmed the details in an email to me yesterday!  
&gt; $Me: Was $ClientManager cc'd?  
&gt; $ESG: No.  
&gt; $Me: Did you send me or $ClientManager this email?  
&gt; $ESG: No. You should have just known to do this.  
  
Oh look, my eye twitch has returned!  
  
&gt; $Me: This requirement isn't even remotely standard for a job of this kind, we'd only do it if explicitly told to do so.  
&gt; $ESG: Well it needs doing. They're unhappy it's missing.  
&gt; $Me: I can take a look, but you'll need to send the details over in an email to me and the client manager. It won't be today though, as it takes hours to run. You'll nee...  
&gt; $ESG (interrupting me):BUT IT HAS TO GO TODAY!  
&gt; $Me: ...eed to tell the client there's a delay.  
&gt; $ESG: WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM?  
  
""That you screwed up and expected everyone else to be psychic"" Oh wait, what I actually said was:  
  
&gt; $Me: Something about a communication error and the spec not being updated with a new requirement, and that we'll resupply to them ASAP.



$ESG then proceeded to walk off mumbling something about incompetence and commission. I then got to work with this extra processing, which I actually managed to get sorted for lunch time the next day. $ClientManager passed the data to $Client, who thanked us for fixing the mistake and getting it over promptly.



Turns out, the client wasn't expecting the file to be output until that day anyway. Were impressed they got it early, impressed that we noticed a mistake (admittedly after they received it), and impressed we still managed to get it completed on time. What the client doesn't know won't hurt them.

For background, I am contractor working for a company \(I will call SupCorp\) contracted to a government agency I will call the Department of HelpME! \(Aka DoH!\) that provides application support and development. I am considered an ""Solutions Analyst"" which is  fancy way of saying I work tier 3 tech support. As such, we do not create tickets. All tickets must go through the main DoH!  service call center either via email or phone. 

Currently, SupCorp is in the middle of deploying a major upgrade to java system wide to prepare for an update of one of the DoH!'s applications. Because they are running multiple versions of Windows, each version has their own service ticket to track deployment. We are currently in user testing on this deployment, with release scheduled this weekend. The deadline for this testing was last Friday. Being a good little drone, I sent out an email to the head of testing ""Abby"" asking if user testing was complete on the three tickets. I included the numbers and what system it was for reference. 

Abby replied they were still testing, and copied the service call center on the email. Ten minutes later, my inbox pings as I get a notification that I have a new ticket assigned to me. I look at the ticket and it was a literal copy paste of my email to Abby.  

Thinking there must be more going on, I called the service center employee, ""Cher"" \(because she is clueless.\)

Me: Hey Cher, I just got service center ticket 666, but it's just a list of tickets 555, 554, and 553. I think Abby may have copied you just so you can update the status on those tickets.

Cher: If we get an email, we are supposed to create a ticket. 

Me: Even if that email isn't a service request? 

Cher: Every email gets a ticket. 

Me: So what should I do with this ticket? Do I need to send it back to you so you can use it to document something?  

Cher: I don't know. Work the ticket.

Me: But isn't it a duplicate, essentially?

Cher: I just create tickets. I don't know.

I hung up the phone in a state of shock and confusion. I've worked with other service center employees and they generally don't open a ticket unless it is a request, especially if the ticket references other tickets. They just update the ticket. I ended up marking the new one as a duplicate and sending it back to the service desk manager.

As with any workplace, some people are more stressed than others. It seemed only natural that one of the more stressful environments came from the special education department. 

One one occasion a teacher came into my office in panic mode, nearly crying, because the computer that she needed for a parent meeting wasn’t coming on and time was running short before her meeting. A student had been on the PC that day and she was convinced that it was now FUBAR. She had checked all the cables to see if anything was loose. 

We had hundreds of these old computers so i had seen just about every that could go wrong with them. On this particular model \(an old IBM\), occasionally the PSU would need to be reset. You could do this by flipping the switch on the back of it from 110 volts to 220 volts then back to 110. Then the computer would come up perfectly normal. 

I entered the room and sat down with the desperate teacher hovering over me, reached around to the back of the computer, checked the cable and flipped the switch. She did not see me flip it, just that i checked the power cable like she had done so many times before. 

Knowing that it would come on, i decided to have just a moment of fun. I put my hands together as if to pray, lowered my head and reached my hand out to top of the monitor. I convulsed just slightly and did what i can only describe as a Benny Hinn impersonation. Raised my head and hit the power button. 

The PC clanked to life and the teacher’s mouth dropped nearly to the floor. I got up from the desk, faked being a little out of breath and just nodded to her. 

BTW, this was a small enough place that we all knew each other pretty well and i had a good working relationship with this teacher. So, when the story started to get out, I came clean about the actual issue and everyone including her got a good laugh out of it.

726,Nickle and Diming a company into oblivion,"tl;dr - saving a few bucks here drains the account elsewhere

While this is not a ""Stupid User Story"" (per submission guidelines), it certainly is a ""Stupid Management Story"" - and that's 'close enough'.

Back in the mid-90s when I was working for |a|n|a|l|o|g| (again!), I was supporting the software that helped manage the spare parts inventory &amp; logistics for the ""Field Service"" side of the organisation.

One of my regular tasks was to access the ""database"" (ISAM files, but well organised enough to be classed as a 'database') via the Data Manipulation Language (DML) directly. On one of these excursions, I noticed the spare-parts inventory of repaired monitors (15"" CRT, 1024x768, full colour, case colour was technocrap white) was in the thousands of repaired units waiting to be placed back into stock.

I contacted the main user of the system, and queried her about this.

&gt; me: Surely this is too many by at least an order of magnitude?  
&gt; she: No, that's about right.

Then she told me a story of a high up manager in MA (USA) who just received a massive bonus because he had shaved $5 a unit for monitors from a Taiwanese manufacturer, $DarkOff. They had earnestly recommended that he purchase the more expensive monitors, as the cheaper ones are known to be unreliable, and require repair/replacement on a frequent basis.

    Of course, this begs the question - ""Why the heck are you even manufacturing this crap in the first place?""  But I digress...


The global order was for several million monitors with the brand |a|n|a|l|o|g| on the front, not $DarkOff, and the... (*take a breath, calm down...*) and the 'manager' had ""saved"" the company tens of millions of dollars - hence his bonus.

Of course, we will ignore the consequences of his 'nickel and diming' - especially the additional resources spent in repairing and warehousing thousands upon thousands of this crap across the globe, and most especially (and I think this was a 'death-blow' to the company) the rock-bottom reputation |a|n|a|l|o|g| now had in a lot of State Government departments in Australia, and no doubt across the globe.

He may have ""saved"" the company several tens of millions of dollars, and scored a nice bonus, but ultimately, at what cost?

$me will be me, $her will be her, to keep it simple.
I appreciate her and she's not completely clueless... Usually.

&gt;$her : Hey $me ! My laptop isn't working this morning, I can't turn it on, I don't understand why... Can you help ?

&gt;$me : Yeah sure, we'll go through the basics : have you plugged it, tried a different outlet ? Is there any light or sound, maybe vibration coming from it ?

&gt;$her : No, absolutely nothing. It was working fine yesterday in the office, but I couldn't use it at home, I don't know what happened

&gt;$me : You took it at home ? You're not really supposed to do that, it should stay on your desk...

&gt;$her : Yeah I know, but I had to for personal reasons, sorry about that... And do you think it would be possible to get a bag for the laptop ? I'm getting tired to keep it under my arm when moving around with it

&gt;$me : What do you mean keep it under your arm ?

&gt;$her : Well, I had to hold it from the office to my home.

From there, I'm reminding myself that tuesday, there was some really bad weather, a lot of rain, which flooded the street, to give you an idea of the intensity. And I fear of what her answer might be when I ask her if she took it under the rain...

&gt;$her : Well, yeah, I had to, I don't have any bag for it

&gt;$me : And... The laptop got wet, right ?

&gt;$her : Yeah... But I dried it and wrapped it in a towel when I was back home

I had to really hold my sigh on the phone, and told her that since the computer was rained on, it was probably dead. She didn't seem to make any connection between the fact that her computer died and the fact that she put it under the rain...
But, well, my manager agreed to give her a brand new laptop, under the condition that it will not, never, ever, leave the office.

Edit :

Well, I sure wasn't expecting this many comments :)
I'll answer to the few frequent questions :

- Why not a desktop instead of a laptop ?

Unfortunately, we don't have our word to say about the equipment, as the tech team. We do not have a single desktop spare to use, and it's easier for our coworkers to use a laptop, since they have a lot of meetings each week. Another reason is that she's supposed to move around in order to meet the clients (and for this, they are given a laptop bag), so a desktop is not really practical...

- Why is our policy not to take the laptops home ?

We have quite a lot of sensitive data, ours, our clients, and the management thinks it's better if the laptop are not used at home. Again, we do not have our word to say about that.

- Why not a lock ?

I can't really answer this, as it's been more than two years since I first started to ask for it. It's never ""the right time"" or they ""don't have a budget"" for this. Management again

- A brand new laptop ?! Why not buy a desktop then ?

We have a few laptop around, some old, some recently bought, and I think they buy them in bulk, so the price is a bit lower. She got a new one, as she sometimes have to meet with a client, and we can't decently give her a Dell Vostro 3500 bought in 2010.

- Will she suffer any consequences ?

I don't really know. We are in two different offices, a few hundred kilometers apart, and I've not seen my manager since monday. I don't think she will have to pay for the laptop, but I hope the management will make her learn the lesson..",False,2951,238,autruip,talesfromtechsupport

I ran into one of the oddest problems I've ever dealt with the other day. A customer - a high-end hairdresser - was having problems with two of her Mac's, complaining about slow internet and the computers locking up. We replaced their consumer wifi product with an enterprise system, but the problems continued. Whenever I would get to the site, the problem would be resolved and everything would work fine, so I began to just randomly pop in and see how things were working.


The other day, I popped in and the girl up front said, ""Perfect timing! This ones locked up!"" I sat down and dug in. Determined that the bluetooth mouse was working, but the left mouse button wouldn't click. The right clicker worked fine. A reboot restored functionality but while I was looking at what could have caused it, the other Mac lost it's left clicker. ""Well, self,"" I said to myself, ""that's interesting."" I plugged a wired mouse in, but still no left click. I turned off the bluetooth mouse, no clicky. I finally discovered that I could turn off bluetooth and get the wired mouse to work.


Looking through the list of bluetooth devices, I found 2 mice active. I start turning off mice, but there's still an ""Administrator Mouse"" connecting. I ask around about more mice and the owner says she has a couple in her purse. She goes and digs them out and, surprisingly, one of them is on.

730,What could go wrong if you let employees wire their desks?,"Some background first:
I work as the only IT admin a medium sized branch office (approx 80 people) and we have just a basic DC-DHCP-AD server and 3 switches.

Monday morning I got in the office as always, and a pack of 5 people rush at me screaming *oh my goood there's no internet at all!!*

Well, they were right. Access points are down, ethernet ports on the wall give no signal whatsoever, and I'm starting to freak out.

I head straight into the server room, and everything looks fine. So basic troubleshooting begins.

Internet was up, wiring was correct (I added a switch a day before, could have messed it up), but I couldn't access our router. I had to run to buy a serial-to-ethernet adapter to access CLI and even after that, the only thing that came to my mind was that the switches died (it happened to another branch a couple weeks before)

4 hours have passed at this point, so I contact my colleagues from HQ explaining the situation, and after letting them do some troubleshooting too, they told me *either you've wired it wrong, switches are dead or* **there's a loop somewhere.**

Here's when it came to my mind. That moring a team moved to a different desk area, and they were let free of moving their own stuff.

Went to check and....... they plugged both ends of an ethernet cable in the wall ports. 

I was angry. Like *really* angry. I removed the cable and threw it in the middle of the room and went to my desk. The problem was still there.

They did not only caused **one** loop, but 2 of them.
The 3rd loop (yes, there were 3 loops at the end) was from an IP phone with ethernet pass-trough with, obviously, both ports connected to the wall jacks.

Reported what happened and removed the loops, network was fine as always. 

Never trust employees, not even on basic stuff.

TL:DR - Whole office was down for 4+ hours due to employees plugging both ends of ethernet cables in the wall socket.

I work at a Data Integration and Managed Services company that also happens to sell and support a few specific data-focused applications. The application i Support is a robust File Transfer application that consolidates various transmission protocols.

One of our customers has been using this software since before I even started with my company. He frequently writes in with the most basic of questions that should have been learned the first day using the software. Today's, though, takes the cake.

For some background, this customer also uses our VAN services for the transmission of data, rather than a direct connection with a partner.

S=Our Software

OS=Other Software

&gt;C: I was viewing a transaction from the VAN portal and I see that we received a transaction, but it's not showing up in our software. Please advise.

&gt;M: Good afternoon C! I'm more than happy to help with this issue. Could you please provide the &lt;Relevant Identification information&gt; so I can look into this transmission issue further?

&gt;C: Provides &lt;Relevant Identification Information&gt;.

&gt;M: I see from the header information that the data was not transmitted with S. It appears that OS was used for sending the data, as well as the acknowledgement.

&gt;C: Yes, we're experimenting with another application. Why didn't the transmission show up in S?

&gt;M: Well, since you used OS for the transmission of data, the acknowledgement would have come in via OS as well. That application is from a completely different company that has no association with us or S. S can only track information that is processed through it.

733,I'm a Kevin,"But I prefer to believe I just pulled a Kevin once.  ( r/storiesaboutkevin )

Worked as tech support for a very large company with stores all over the country.  We'd have to regularly remote in to their store servers, which supported their cash registers.

Due to the fact that the company used xml files to post prices and sales to each store, updates would take hours for each store. 

Due to the fact that the people who set up the prices and xml files, as well as regular failures of the update process, the registers wouldn't show the correct prices when customers tried to purchase items on sale.

So often, on the day after new updates were done, we'd get tons of tickets about prices being wrong.  We'd telnet into the server, check whether the xml file had the item and price, and if it did, rerun the load. If not, call the marketing team and have them regenerate the xml, and then we'd rerun the load.  I don't remember if we did the push to the store or if they did.  Even after the load finished, you'd have to check to make sure the prices were correct now.  If not, you'd have to do it all again.

But there was no direct way to see how far the load was.  You had to run a command to see what it was doing.  Even then, it didn't say how many records.  So you could type the command to view it, and then repeat the command, but it was easier to wait and do other tickets while this was going on, and then check later.

I had one store where the load didn't work, so I figured out the problem and reran it.  Problem is, it's been hours now and the store manager is getting frustrated about these price issues today not being fixed.  So I needed to wait until it's done and then verify it as soon as the load was complete.

But it was annoying having to keep rerunning that command to see whether it was done, so I had I brilliant Kevin like idea.  I would create a batch file that would run the command every few seconds on this store's server.

It worked wonderfully.  Would scroll showing the status, and I could just sit there watching it.

I could, until we got another call from that store screaming about how their registers were hung.  Oops.  Boy the manager was pissed.

734,Customer has pre-existing issues outside of the scope of the repair i'm doing? must be my fault when I don't prevent further issues.,"So I work as a computer repair tech. One of our clients came in yesterday. He needed a screen replaced on his laptop because it was cracked and wasn't working. We opened the computer up to find that there were some screws rolling around. 

The thing is, he said the computer was working just fine before he took it in. That's all great and dandy, but that doesn't change the fact that there are now a dozen screws rolling around in your laptop. 

So, I make sure to find and re-screw in any and all screws that I need in order to do this repair, along with any screwholes I can get to easily. 

Some of the screwholes are inaccessible without removing more component that are entirely outside of the scope of this repair. I decide to finish my repair and tell the customer about this. I can tell that whoever last repaired this device didn't know what the fuck they're doing because honestly it isn't hard to screw in a screw properly.

So, I tell her i can do that for a small extra fee. In the past my boss (Senior technician, he's been here a long time.) has been really strict on the ROI for repairs. If it takes too long to do a particular repair, I get reprimanded for taking too long because that's money we can earn doing someone else's repair. 

So, I decide to do the bare minimum in order to make sure this repair goes smoothly and suggest the customer come back later to ask my boss for a discount on getting his shit fixed because its #notmyfault and his existing issue with screws coming out isn't preventing my repair from working properly.

I then get a call from my boss, reprimanding me, because apparently a screw got loose and fucked up his computer. 

So I: 

1) either removed all loose screws

2) or tightened any existing screws

but because another screw gets loose I get reprimanded.

735,Dueling Dual Monitors,"The following tale is set in a small, East Coast office environment wherein I am often called to provide on-site tech support when our corporate tech support (West Coast) is unavailable or needs a pair of eyeballs on the problem. Lately, I've had issues where our new hires feel they need not just two, but even three or four monitors. All requests for additional monitors have been denied. 


The cast is as follows:


**$Me**: Yours truly.

**$CSL**: Our delightfully competent Customer Service Leader.

**$NewGirl**: A recent hire who defies explanation. The office pool is currently giving her till Friday before she gets the boot. Incompetence given human form.


Our tale begins in the early hours of the morning as I'm leaving my house for the office. $CSL calls me because $NewGirl's computer isn't working, and wants to know when I'll be there to fix it. Since it will be at least 30 minutes before I get there, and $NewGirl can't work without a functional computer, I try to begin diagnosing the problem over the phone.

$CSL tells me $NewGirl's monitors aren't working, both were only giving a blank screen, so I began running through general troubleshooting; are the monitors on, cables connected, yada yada, but nothing's working. I'm at a loss for what the problem could be, but we've had bad weather lately and consider a power surge may have knocked a monitor out. 

I start walking $CSL through getting a replacement monitor out of the storage room, when she helpfully volunteers they can only see the cursor on the screen. 

&gt;$Me: ""Wait, what?! I thought they were blank."" 

&gt;$CSL: ""Well, yeah they're blank except for the cursor.""

Okaaaaay.... so we're not dealing with dead monitors. 

&gt;$Me: ""Well, did you try turning it off and on again?""
 
&gt;$CSL: ""Yes, let me check the cables again.""

&gt;$Me: ""No, please don't, I think we're dealing with a software issue here.""

So I have them reboot into safe mode, which works, then into normal mode, which also works, so problem solved. Great.


Later in the day I'm in the office when $NewGirl pops in to say she's having the same issue again. I walk over and find two black screens with only the cursor visible. No amount of clicking, Ctrl+Alt+Del'ing or Ctrl+Shift+Esc'ing produces any result, so I reboot a few times, each time it works, but then suddenly cuts out again.

Well, darn. Maybe there is an intermittent hardware fault here. I go to check the cables again, when to my surprise I find 2 VGA cables and 1 DVI cable plugged into the back of the PC. That can't be right, there's only 2 monitors. Also, one of the VGA ports goes to the onboard card, and one goes to the external card. You can't use both simultaneously.

&gt;$Me: ""Why are there three cables?"" 

No one answers.

I disconnect the VGA attached to the onboard card and voila! it works! Happy to have it working, but still confused where the extra cable came from I begin tugging on it to pull it out from behind the desk since its certainly not needed. Strangely, it seems to be attached to something?!

Tracing the cable I find it plugged into one of the two monitors, right alongside the DVI cable.

&gt;$Me: ""Who ran two cables to the same monitor?"" 

&gt;$NewGirl: ""I did.""

&gt;$Me: ""... But why?""

&gt;$NewGirl: ""I saw there were 2 ports so I wanted to enable dual monitors on that one"".

I glared back at $NewGirl as if to say, ""It does not work that way. Why are you messing with your PC? Why aren't you focusing on the tasks you've been assigned which you cannot handle? Why are you here? How do you function as an adult human being?"". Of course, all of that is left unsaid. 

A long silence follows.

***doom doom doom doom***

A subtle thrumming sounded throughout the helpdesk room that afternoon. Not really audible but noticeable, even over the clatter of phones, talking, and whatever dubiously stupid, non-work related topic is being discussed (Why anyone would go to Africa, it being a 3rd world country; being the choice topic of the afternoon. Don't ask. Never ask. Rule 1 of HelpDesk. Rule 2 is, Always Bring Donuts.)

As was typical, $WhaIdo was listening to the Spooty music service.... No one was really sure how he managed to get a $150 Logitech speaker system for his workstation, but have one he did. With MAXBASS.

***doom doom doom doom***

$WhaIdo liked dance music.

***doom doom doo---*** For a few moments the conversation where we were trying to get $Silly to understand that Africa was a continent, not a country, continued. Then the lack of MAXBASS started to sink in.

&gt;""$WhaIDo, why'd you turn off your music?"" I queried from halfway across the room.

&gt;""I dunno Wha I do. It just stopped.""

After a few moments, every phone in the room started ringing. Quite rapidly, the status board for the call queue began racking up the number of users on hold.

$Silly's lesson on Eastern continent geography put on hold, we began answering the phones as rapidly as possible; as HelpDesks in crisis mode are wont to do. The first few all said the same thing; $MainApp is not working. The third call I get is not from one of our local buildings, but an offsite location, and the fourth is a VMWare Horizon user...

Quickly making some tests, one thing becomes immediately apparent... the entire company has no WAN access. Not just here, but all remote sites as well.

T.

F.

Around the fifth call... ***doom doom doom doom***

&gt;Everyone turns to look at $WhaIDo's desk. ""Do we have the internet back up?"" someone asks.

&gt;""Sounds like it,"" comes a response.

***Doom doom doo---*** Once again, the music stops.

***Doom Doo---***

***Doo----- om…. Doo---***

Every few minutes, it would play about 5 seconds of music. At this point, we have no idea what the Networking Team is up to; but it is obviously in their area. I decide to do a ping to Google, and all packets drop. But, how? If all packets are dropping, then why are we still hearing *Yolanda Be Cool* tell us that *We No Speak Americano*?

On a whim, I decide to run ping continuously. And thus, after 30 seconds I find, 98% packet loss, and average response times of over 4000ms! A quick IM to my **Cult of ShadowIT** (the only way anything actually gets done in IT) contact in the Networking team, to find out if they noticed this yet turns out to be a good idea as they were still working their way through the layers to find where the problem was and hadn't yet noticed the high latency, as their initial test wasn't getting through either.

I don't know what magic powers they have, but though their use, Networking quickly found that something was completely saturating our outbound WAN. We're talking 2x 10Gb fiber for our primary load balanced access, plus whatever else we have for backups.

**OVER 20Gb SATURATED?!?**

We continue to handle the absurd amount of calls from all over the US. Sporadically backed with snippets of MAXBASS. After about 30 minutes we hear it:

***doom doom doom doom doom***

It keeps going… 10 seconds… 20 seconds… 30 seconds! A WHOLE MINUTE!

WE HAVE INTERNET BACK!!!

I verify I can reach google, apple, reddit, dslreports.... my usual web access test. All of them work! All of them to the backing track of ***doom doom doom doom***

The music keeps playing. ***doom doom---*** My heart begins to flutter. Not again!

Oh. It was just another song starting.

&gt;$EngineerHutt speaks up from the back of the room where he sits; ""It's okay, I fixed the WAN issue, and we should be fine now!""

He... fixed the WAN issue? How? He's not networking. He doesn't have access to anything close to that level. Despite his name, he actually doesn't have the power a large smuggling ring and a retinue of bikini clad slave Carrie Fishers. He does, however, have the equal amount of undeserved ego.

I find out about an hour later. In a way $EngineerHutt did fix the problem. Mostly because he WAS the problem. Turns out that the WAN was saturated because $EngineerHutt decided 1pm would be an ideal time to update all of the SCCM distribution servers across the entire company.

Really, I'm not sure who to fault here. Him for doing an update like this with no planning or notification; or Networking for never hearing of a thing called QoS?

This did not end up being the only time his Huttness managed to kill the WAN.

740,The 'Thing',"This happened a few hours ago and left me with this soothing calmness inside me that I'm sure most of you have felt at some point or another. It's not terribly exciting or perhaps interesting. Maybe it might be relateble...

Humility and victory.

**Background**: One of our clients decided to 'deallocate' their offices here in Sweden last year. We took down most of their equipment, sent back what needed to be sent back, ran killdisk on what needed to be killed.
What remained however was 'The Thing'. The Thing is a IBM iseries 740. I have built vast virtualized clusters, deployed seemingly magical solutions to esoteric problems but none of that pride I feel in work compares to the primal uncertainty and dread I feel
when I'm close to 'The Thing'. The client in question wanted us to host this monstrosity for a ten year period, us supplying the means for them to connect to it when needed. The same was to made of a specific finance software.

The players:

**$me** - Exhausted cat lady and caffeine enthusiast.

**$pcat** - Networking Wizard and Office Dad.

**$biblicalname** - My cloud-partner in crime. Also Mr. Meseeks.

**$IBMdude** - Soft spoken thaumaturge of everything Big Blue. Does not work for there.


My boss told me to mount it up and connect it when we got
it and that was the last I heard of it until Sunday. I had been to an MS course for the better part of a week and was exhausted, having not had any real down time in nearly two weeks and was relaxing when the email showed up.

&gt;""High Priority! The Thing and $financesoftware needs to be reachable over VPN by Tuesday.""

&gt;""Oki dokey"" I replied, rubbing the belly of fattest of my two cats. No rest for the weary.

Thinking that I could keep ahead of the coming weeks onslaught I provisioned a VM with our cloud partner, setup and installed $financesoftware and then started fiddling with Routing and Remote Access. Which refused to work at all.
Having struggled with it well into the night, having gone so far as to provision and new VM and test my configuration on that one, I came to the office on Monday with a total of zero results and 4 hours of sleep.
After a few cups of liquid life (coffee) I decided to screw the rules and do it another way I knew worked. I rang my expert.

&gt;**$me**: ""Hi $biblicalname, it's $me. Could you set up a OpenVPN solution for this account?"" *I sent him the details.*

&gt;**$biblicalname**: ""Sure can! I'll gateway it through pfSense wall. How many clients?""

&gt;**$me**: ""Two, me and one called $client""

&gt;**$biblicalname**: ""Gimme an hour.""

&gt;**$me**: ""Brilliant! Thanks!""

An hour later I had a working VPN solution for $financesoftware. Which meant I now needed to face The Thing. Having had it rigged up but not powered up, it sat, silent and foreboding in our server room.

&gt;**$me**: ""$pcat... do you have any idea how to boot this thing up?""

&gt;**$pcat**: ""Nope. But I tried to Google it..."" *he said, and poked a bit at the mysterious LCD console.* ""I don't think I got it right though.""

&gt;**$me**: ""So did I..."" *I said, remembering the wall of opaque information, terminology and standards that I had met when I had attempted a cursory glance at it.*

For those who never have encountered these pieces of hardware, they run on what I decided to call 'IWODT' - IBM Way of Doing Things. For example, you can't just click the power button. You need to go through a tiny display to specify boot options etc.
And then it runs through, the gods know, how many SRC codes that tells you were in the boot process it is. 

To be fair and honest - this might not even be true! Maybe the power button can just be pressed! I knew nothing about this and had to learn it quickly if I were to meet the deadline. Plowing through Googled articles, IBM specs and references at
caffeine and nicotine addled pace I managed after a while to determine that I indeed knew absolutely nothing. The Thing was built to outlast human life. An inscrutable black box to a Non-IBM simpleton as myself.

I pride myself in being able to learn knew things quickly and putting them into practice but this felt so inscrutable, unknowable, that my own doubt was putting the whole venture into jeopardy. 

I need expert advice. 

Thankfully I knew a guy who I had worked with when the Thing needed some TLC a few years back.


&gt;**$IBMdude**: ""This is $IBMdude at $notactuallyIBM.""

&gt;**$me**: ""It's $me. How the hell do I boot a iseries 740?"" *I said, skipping any greeting.*

&gt;**$IBMdude**: *chuckles* ""Long time no see. Go to function 1, set N and not M. Press power.""

&gt;**$me**: ""Done. Now what?""

&gt;**$IBMdude**: ""Wait for it..."" *(he didn't say this but he might as well, because a moment later I was blasted by the screaming of fans).*

&gt;**$me:** ""Gods..."" *I step out of the server room.* ""Second question, which NIC should I connect? It's the same machine you got sent from $client a while back.""

&gt;**$IBMdude**: ""Hold on... I think it should be T1. In all likelihood it will have a static IP.""

&gt;**$me**: ""Which you don't have documented?"" *I said, despair setting in.*

&gt;**$IBMdude**: ""Sorry, $me.""

&gt;**$me**: ""I'll manage. Thanks for the help though!""

&gt;**$IBMdude:** ""No worries.""

Now began the hunt for which NIC the machine used to do whatever it did. Thankfully I had help. $Pcat is a network wizard. However, the Thing had eight different NIC's, marked HMC, T1 and so on which to the uninitiated meant nothing.
I asked him to set up a VPN and reserve a network for me while I hunted down the specifics. In my naiveté I thought I might be able gleam some information from IBM's manuals in regards to this but was met with terminology that in context
of how nearly everything else is done in IT today, is alien. I plowed through a functions reference while I sat with wireshark to try and gather something, anything, from the NIC's on the machine and discovered function 30.
Function 30 displays some Ethernet information. Not being able to ping anything on the ports I had tested so far I click myself into it and found an IP. Excited I wrote it down, connected a cable and configured things appropriately. I got a ping response.
I nearly wept.

&gt;**$me**: ""$pcat! I GOT AN ADDRESS!"" *I cried, grinning like an idiot.*

&gt;**$pcat**: ""Nice! I'll reconfigure the VPN. I'll mail you.""

30 minutes later I was pinging the machine via VPN.

&gt;**$pcat**: ""I love ARP-proxy. Dirty as hell but it works.""

&gt;**$me**: ""I'd settle for just about anything now.""

741,I Can't Edit This Word Document,"Happened the other day before quitting time. Here I am planning my well\-executed escape out of the office with detailed plans to dodge people and get to my scheduled commute home. Then, blammo, a tech support call comes in. Obvious swearing and damnation instantly rummage across my brain and suddenly end as soon as I answered this call.

$NYFranc: Good afternoon, this is Help Desk, how can I help you?

$Retail: I can't edit this Word document, can you help me?

$NYFranc: What error\(s\) are you getting?

$Retail: No errors, just that I type and nothing happens. I'm confused. Please remote in and help me.

$NYFranc: No worries, will remote in ASAP.

I thought it was a simple issue with a Word document, well, it was, but common sense was lacking with this person from the Retail Department.

After a few seconds of remote PC surfing, I entered the PC of $Retail and did a few obvious checks. While $Retail claims she did nothing wrong, I assured her that it's ok and disturbing the Help Desk team 20 minutes before closing time was ok \(really in my mind, **IT WASN'T!**\)

* Document locked, nope.
* Any odd add\-ins, macros, and Microsoft weirdness, nope.
* Corrupt file, nope.

After doing the obvious guesswork and the lack of coffee in my system \(**I should be a coffee ambassador \- read my past stories on why!**\), I was in ""bleep it"" mode and decided to type to mess with the contents of the document itself. The $Retail user gasped very loudly and passionately as I attempted to cause chaos. Then, I stumbled upon it, the contents of the Word documents was all PICTURES! Bleeping PICTURES! $Retail actually tried to type on graphics itself like it was Photoshop.

$NYFranc: Um, yea, your Word document's contents is all pictures.

$Retail: Really?!

$NYFranc: Yes, really! It never occurred to you for one brief moment that all of it was pictures. Most likely, whoever gave you this document did a poor job in exporting it as a Word document.

$Retail: \(total silence for 15 seconds\)

$Retail: Ah yes, it makes sense. Thankfully, a colleague just noticed this and e\-mailed me the same version just now and with words, not pictures. Thank you very much for the help. You're very sweet. Bye!

I figured since my supervisor will review the ticket, either I get reprimanded for being blunt or praised for being professional and the caller will give a negative rating for me. I reported in this morning. E\-mail from supervisor:

$NYFranc, job well done on that last ticket. Also, her supervisor called me after hours to praise your commitment to the Retail Team.

P.S. Don't forget your coffee!

742,The dial-up ADSL connection that didn't work,"
Back in the early 2000s a neighbour of mine had upgraded his old dial-up connection to a brand new ADSL 8/1 connection through his ISP. He was installing it with another neighbour acting as technical and morale support, but they couldn't get it to work. That's when they called the nerdy teenager living next door for help.

After arriving at the scene I found everything to be superficially correct. The family PC and the ADSL modem were located in the laundry room. Both had power and were turned on, and connected properly to each other and the wall with network and phone cables. Still, the internet connection was not working.

&gt; $Neighbour1: ""I ordered the upgrade from ISP and they gave me this modem, but we can't get it to work.""

&gt; $Neighbour2: ""I think the problem is the phone number in the PC's dial-up connection settings here, see?""

&gt; $Me: ""Hmm, no, the ADSL connection doesn't use the dial-up stuff, the PC just needs an ethernet connection to the modem with the correct network settings.""

&gt; $Neighbour2: ""No, I don't think that is correct. See if I go here and then...""

*10 minutes later*

&gt; $Neighbour2: ""And see, it's still not working. I don't know what the problem is.""

&gt; $Me: ""Let me have a look. It's probably the WAN settings in the modem or the PC's network settings.""

*Clickety click click*

&gt; $Me: ""No, the PC's network settings are fine. It's getting the IP address automatically from the modem's DHCP and we can connect to the modem's control panel through the browser. It must be the modem's WAN settings then.""

*More clickety clicks*

&gt; $Me: ""The WAN settings look fine to me. See here *pointing* the settings are what the ISP says they should be. I'm not sure what the problem is, maybe a faulty modem or phone cable?""

&gt; $Neighbour2: ""It's the dial-up settings, the number is wrong. Let me take a look again.""

While $Neighbour2 checks the dial-up settings for the umpteenth time, I go through the whole setup in my head trying to figure out what the problem could be. Usually it turns out to be a faulty cable or the, at the time, ubiquitous Telehell ADSL modem built from a potato grown by the lowest bidder in Belarussia. In this case both would seem unlikely since everything is new. Then I get an idea.

&gt; $Me: ""Has the ISP opened the ADSL connection on their end yet?""

&gt; $Neighbour1: ""Well, surely they have, but... Well, I don't know. Let me make a call.""

*One call to ISP later*

&gt; $Neighbour1: ""Yeah, they haven't opened it yet.""

&gt; $Me: ""There's your problem then. It should start working with the current setup as soon as the ISP gets the connection up and running.""

And that's how I earned pizza money that day.

$Eyore is not a very good programmer.  I'm a terrible programmer, and I know it and avoid code grinding when and where I can, which is why I'm an IT systems guy. 

$Eyore is a poor programmer and thinks he's great, and thinks his greatness extends into other areas of IT-ish-ness, like his home PC.

Over the last two weeks or so, $Eyore has been over in his cube talking to his son on the phone, figuring out a new PC he wants to build. Then, he'd ask me ""Whats your opinion on AMD vs Intel?"" or some other similarly rando question. Shop talk. OK. Whatever. At first you're polite, but then, as you'd expect, the floodgates open. ""What kind of SSD should I get? Whats the difference between 6Gb and 3Gb SSDs?"" ""What an Intel Optane memory module?"" ""Do you think I should get onboard video?"" ""Whats a good cooler fan setup?""

Now, I've built PCs for home but I've really gotten to the point these days where I tell someone who asks me about building a PC ""Go to this mom &amp; pop computer store, or TigerDirect, and get one of their barebones kits with the CPU combo you want, then add to it."" That usually shuts people up.

Not $Eyore. It just made it *worse*.  $Eyore orders all the parts for his super stupendo PC build, and they start arriving late last week. I hear his running commentary over the cube wall ""Oh, the mother board just showed up"" or ""I go the wrong RAM, so I need to send that back..""  Dude, I'm not encouraging you. I'm **WORKING**.

Friday afternoon, he shows up late (most of the company was on holiday, and those that were left were released in the early afternoon) with some long convoluted tale of a trip to the DMV, a forgotten suit for a wedding, misdelivery of one of the PC components and a trip to find the postman, the delivery of the other components, etc, before he finally deigns to show up at the office after everybody, including our boss, has left for the day.

&gt;$Eyore: ""Hey, if I run in to trouble working on this over the weekend, can I call you?""

&gt;$Me: ""No.""

&gt;$Eyore: ""Well, I mean, I don't think I will...""

&gt;$Me: ""And I don't think I'll answer.""

He did call my cell on Sunday, and I was conveniently unavailable. ""Sorry, wife &amp; I were kayaking the lower Congo with Prince Harry and ol' whatshername...""

So he schlepps this PC into the building this morning as he comes shambling in the door.

&gt;$Eyore: ""I'm having some driver problems.""

&gt;$Me: ""Don't plug that PC into the network.""

&gt;$Eyore: ""I'll put it on the guest wireless.""

&gt;$Me: ""Why do you even have it in here?""

&gt;$Eyore: ""I wanted you to look at it...""

&gt;$Me: ""OK, but I need you to code a mobile app for me first. With a database interface.""

He drops the thing on his desk and hooks it up to  a spare monitor and starts fucking with it.

&gt;$Eyore: ""This thing was such a pain to assemble.."" (I hear the POST as Win 10 comes up.. 4 second boot, not bad)

&gt;$Eyore: ""The motherboard wouldn't fit in to the case.."" 

(He's clicking the mouse and mumbling about drivers and the guest wifi password)

&gt;$Eyore: ""there's like a radius to the recessed area and the motherboard didn't fit into that raised area, so..""

(I'm rolling my eyes hard. Jesus, do you not have any professional manners, guy?)

&gt;$Eyore: ""so I had to drill out a little part of the case in the corner of that recess so the mother board would fit...""

I suddenly perk up.. wait, wut?

&gt;$Eyore: "".. and then I had to go out and get more screws because the screws that came with it didn't fit, so I could screw the motherboard into the case.""

&gt;$Me: (standing up in my cube) ""Wait, hold on a second. The motherboard didn't fit into the case recess? What do you mean?""

&gt;$Eyore: (he unscrews the side of the case and points inside) ""Right there. See where I had to drill it out? And the screws that came with it were too short to fit into the holes in the bottom of the case..""

(I can't really see inside this thing from my cube)

&gt;$Me: (Coming around the cube wall) ""Turn it off. Did you install the standoffs that came with the hardware?""

&gt;$Eyore: ""What? There were some screws in a baggie..""

&gt;$Me: ""Shut off the computer, now...""

&gt;$Eyore: ""Why? Its running OK, I just have some driver..""

I reach around the back of the PC and click the rocker on the power supply, and then pull the cord.

&gt;$Eyore: ""What did you do that for?""

&gt;$Me: ""Do you not understand that you basically just shorted your motherboard against the metal of the case?""

&gt;$Eyore: ""Whaaa?""

&gt;$Me: ""Take this thing out of the building and put it in your car. This is not your personal tech support place. You want to build computer, fine. You want to ask me a couple questions, fine.  But what you're doing is way, way beyond that and you're taking advantage of professional courtesy.""

Went through each a couple of times with appropriate waiting times in between.

Checked in with $NA for advice, and after a chat with him, and checking $ISP outages in the area (there were none) he recommended to check in with them. Okay, email our contact with $ISP with a description of the problem and the onsite contact details. After a short while, I get a response:

Site had router connected to UNI-D Port 1 but the service is provisioned on UNI-D Port 2.

The lad was around 14 and had  almost done it correctly. He had set the printer up, and run the install disk to  setup the driver on  the pc,  but it wouldn't  connect with the wireless network and he thought that he would have to use a USB lead to program the printer, and naturally there wasn't one in the house.

In the mid 90's, my father bought our first computer. It was a ZEOS 486 and came with a 3.5"" Floppy Drive, a 5.25"" Floppy drive, and a CD-Rom that you needed special cases to use. (You inserted the CD into a tray that had a flip-top lid and the bottom opened up like a floppy exposing the bottom of the CD)

It was my first exposure to software and hardware because I sat with my father as he Installed new hard drives, RAM, windows 95 etc...

So the computer lasted well into the 2000's and when my family upgraded to a Dell with Windows XP, the ZEOS became mine... and my brother's.


The machine was a workhorse. I wrote most of my papers on it, played a bunch of DOOM and loaded it up with all the music it could hold... until one day... one day it just stopped working.


It would boot to the windows 98 desktop, freeze and die. Regularly. I messed with it for weeks before I considered it dead and gave up. My father recommended we drill a hole in the hard drive before tossing it so I began taking the machine apart. I had the hole in the hard drive when I decided to see how a floppy drive worked.

I pried open the 5.25"" floppy drive and saw..... a CD... My brother in his infinite wisdom shoved a CD into the floppy drive. (commence crying)
I could only imagine that the machine was trying to read a CD via the floppy drive and didn't much like the fact that it couldn't do so.

Much to my dismay the hard drive was already toast and my computer disassembly technique had not been established yet; the final nail was driven into the coffin.

I received a call from $Doctor that his $MA couldn't access a certain part of our EHR that he could, but that he needed her to access in order to get this part of his job out of the way, so he could see patients. He explained to me that the only difference between his workstation and hers is the fact that he has firefox installed and uses the EHR in that browser, whereas she uses internet explorer and does not have the option of using firefox. Thus, he believed that it was a browser issue (common to $crappyEHR, and part of the reason she uses IE instead of firefox/chrome is that the $crappyEHR's specimen label print function only works properly in IE). He did not check what she was doing, as he trusts her due to their years working together. 


I came down to his department in person, as I was doing my daily check of how things were in the building anyway, and had him show me what he needed her to do. Having confirmed that this is something she needed to be able to do, I went to the room she was working from, opened IE under her username and password (she entered herself) to confirm she couldn't and...proceeded to perfectly replicate the exact same thing $doctor had just done in Firefox, with $MA and $doctor looking over my shoulder as I did so, to which he answer was to $doctor that she'd told him not that she couldn't do it, but that she didn't know how.

From the new router, two LAN cables went in to two different powerlines adapters.  The other two were plugged in to the old ISP wireless router and and even older wireless router.  Even though it looked a mess everything should theoretically be working.  

After a quick examination it was determined that the new router was faulty, removed it and moved everything else up the line so as not to cause confusion and everything works as it used to.

It was a fairly slow day, I was trying to look busy while sipping a cup of builder’s tea at my desk when I saw a new email addressed to me:

Below that, I saw some back-and-forth email between $Salesperson and $CustomerIT. As a background, $Customer is a household brand that you will see at least a few times a day. Apparently, they were deploying a new application for internal use, and was looking to purchase some servers. 

Fair enough, I don’t normally work with server opportunities since I’m more of a network guy, but this doesn’t seem to be that complicated. So I called $Salesperson on her cell.

&gt;Hi $Me,

&gt;Yeah, you won’t find much about that. I think we’re one of the only few people crazy enough to buy them (*Of course, he was much more diplomatic about this than __I__ was*). I attached the requirement from $Appvendor for your reference. Also, I won’t be needing any engineering services from you, just make sure it boots before delivery. We need to be up and running in two month’s time. 

&gt;Cheers,

&amp;nbsp;

The requirement itself was pretty big for the time but wasn’t really crazy either. Three servers, dual socket Xeons, lots of RAM, a couple of spinning disks. I was a bit worried about delivery time, but I fired an email to the usual suspects (Dell, HP, IBM) for a quote. 

A couple of days later, I sent the three quotes to $Salesperson to give $Customer a couple of options and proceeded to move on with my life.

I highly respect $Manager for a lot of things, but his calmness under pressure and his penchant for understatement are definitely somewhere on top. While he said ‘lively complaint’ what truly happened in the email thread preceding it is closer to ‘on-chair bowel evacuation’ for $SalesDirector 

Apparently we had sent $Customer -who is now just few days away from deadline-  a server with the wrong specification. $CustManager even sent us screenshots of the servers’ specification. All of them are woefully below what I remember was required. Hell, I’m sure my gaming PC back then was faster than any of those three. I felt my stomach turning.

&amp;nbsp;

Huh. 

&amp;nbsp;

‘Huh’ was my exact reaction reading this email, I remember this vividly because a few desks away, $Manager made the exact same sound before calling me to join him and $Salesperson.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;$Salesperson: Hi $CustomerIT, I have $Me and $Manager in this call.

&gt;$CustomerIT: Hi guys, I understand my boss was a bit… 

&gt;$Manager: I’d say ‘animated’

&gt;$CustomerIT: … animated earlier today, sorry about that. That’s because we need to present the application to C-Level next week.

&gt;$Manager: Don’t worry about that, $SalesDirector took most of the brunt. I need to ask though, did *__we__* even provide those servers?

&gt;$Salesperson: Yea, I don’t remember receiving any PO for them 

&gt;$CustomerIT: You guys didn’t. Our new procurement, bless his noble intentions, decided to shop around for a price comparison. What he should do was confirm with me before issuing PO, guess what he did. 

&gt;$Me: Buy from whoever bid lowest?

&gt;$CustomerIT: That he did. If they provided the same specification we won’t be having this conversation. 

&gt;$Me: Ouch, what’s your plan for the deadline , then?

&gt;$CustomerIT: Honestly not too sure. We have the application running temporarily on a spare PC we have, but once users start testing I don’t think it will hold. I can’t use any other servers for various reasons. We’re definitely preparing to purchase your original quotation, though. 

&gt;$Me: Yeah, that thing will melt. Say, do you really need all three servers to run it? 

&gt;$CustomerIT: Two for application redundancy, one for DB, yeah.

&gt;$Me: Can you pull the CPU and RAM from one server and put it in the other server?

&gt;$CustomerIT: Yeah, but won’t it mess with the warranty?

&gt;$Me: Honestly not sure.

&gt;$Manager: We can’t officially recommend it, but I think that’s a valid solution. Better if you can add some more RAM. I’ll check if we have some spare laying around

&gt;$CustomerIT: I’ll try that. I’ll contact you guys later.

&amp;nbsp;

The servers we quoted originally have two CPUs (eight cores total) and 64GB RAM each. $CustomerIT managed to convince $AppVendor to try and install it on a server with four core CPU and 8GB RAM. That server managed to heroically last through user testing phase (with some noted performance complaints) while we scrambled to prepare the replacements. 

It was a mistake from $Customer’s procurement that cost them maybe an extra $3000-4000 on top of our ~$20000 quote (plus whatever it was to expedite delivery), though still only a drop in the bucket compared to what $Application cost them. 

What amused me the most was $CustManager's sheepish expression when we met with him after that fiasco. Now that's entertainment.

Story participants
Me: Slazer
Boss: the boss
T1: Tech 1
T2 Tech 2

---------------------------------

Backstory

The boss is all about redundancy and backup. If he finds a single point of failure that I have missed he lets us know and sets a time frame for when he wants it resolved along with a when the failover testing should be done.  Because an untested backup is worse than no backup.

---------------------------------

To spare the boring BGP details

We have 2 data centres in our closest state capitol. With transit multihomed transit through a single level 2 carrier (while not true multihomed we have transit of last resort through one of our layer 2 customers). 

One day the boss arrives in the office around 10:30 AM after being in a huff about hearing of a major outage in a competitors network.

&gt;Boss: Slazer, did you get our traffic balanced over our 2 transit paths like we discussed a while ago?

&gt;Me: Yes, DC1 advertises prefix 1,3,5 and the aggregate. DC2 advertises prefixes 2,4,6 and the aggregate.

&gt;Boss: What happens when one of the transit fails?

&gt;Me: I am advertising the DC2 prefixes out DC1 with the backup BGP community. Then doing the same thing for DC1 prefixes over DC2.  In the event of a transit failure the upstream has a backup path ready to go.

&gt;Boss: and it works?

&gt;Me: Yes, last time I tested it was about 2 or 3 months ago and it failover over correctly.

&gt;Boss: Why haven't you tested it sooner? 

&gt;Me: RANCID hasn't reported a configuration change since the last test.  I only test it if there has been a config change on and of those routers.

&gt;Boss: But how can you be sure it still works?

&gt;Me: Shall I force a failover now to show it works?

&gt;Boss: Sure.  (which I assume he said with sarcasm) 

Me: *Starts logging to DC1 core router*

T1 seeing me do my configuration change face.

&gt;T1: If you are doing that I am going for a break.

I shutdown our transit interface for DC1 and wait for BGP to time out.

After about 10 min with no calls the boss turns around and continues the conversation.

&gt;Boss: So when will you be testing the failover?

&gt;Me: We are, right now.

&gt;Boss: What??!! *as his face drops.* 

&gt;Me: You agreed. Plus this way now you know for sure it works because the phones haven't started ringing.

&gt;T2: Slazer is right.  The graphs show how an increase in traffic on DC2 transit.

Boss slides over to T2 desk. Sure enough, the graph for DC1 transit is reading zero traffic and the graph for DC2 is showing all the transit traffic for the state.

&gt;Boss: That doesn't looks like much traffic. 

&gt;Me: Only about 20-30% of our traffic goes via Transit, the rest goes via the various IXs we are on.

&gt;Boss: Who don't we get via the IX?

&gt;Me: Customers of our transit provider who aren't on any IX, Telstra and Optus as they aren't on any IX, and any international site that doesn't use a CDN.

We continue discussing for a good 20 - 30 min about where we get various traffic from and further redundancy in the core networks. During which time T1 returns from his break.

&gt;T1: Phones are quiet?

&gt;Me: Yes.

&gt;Boss: Can you turn the DC1 transit back on?

I walk back to my desk and turn the transit interface back on and see the BGP peer back on.  While T2 and the boss are watching the graph for DC2 transit it drops about 2/3 of traffic and that appears back on DC1 transit.

753,Copy/paste,"Hi boys and girls!

First post on r/talesfromtechsupport so forgive me if I mess up but i had to share this one.

I’m a 29yo tech support engineer from the Netherlands.

This particular story is about a customer who calls daily and never fails to prove that everyone can start a business and even be successful even when they have an IQ of room temperature (that joke is funniest in Celsius) 

I’ll go with a simple $me and $him for this story. 

$me hi this is $me speaking, how may I help you?

$him yeah this is $him I’m having trouble transferring a file from one pc to the other... ($him proceeds to explain into extreme detail what the document is and why he needs it on the other pc... why do people do that...)

$me can you tell me how you are trying to transfer the file? Is it by e-mail, your home drive or maybe an other shared network directory?

$him no I just put the thingy in the usb and copy it, then I put it in the other pc but it’s not working. 

Yes, it baffles the mind how someone can have a successful taxi company with over 30 cars in service and not be able to use an USB drive to copy a file.  At this point, I know I’m not going to be able to explain how this works just by telling him. I have to show him. 

$me ok can I use $remote-control-software on both pcs to see what’s wrong? 

He proceeds to give me the info and i’m looking at the users desktops. pc1 has a explorer window open with a file selected, as you would expect in this situation.

$me can you tell me step by step what you do to copy this file?

$him yeah I copy it by rightclicking it and then I unplug the USB and plug it in the other pc and it’s not working!

I notice he’s getting a bit frustrated. 

$me that sounds like how it should work, can you show me?

What happened next blew my mind. He right-clicks on the file on pc1 and clicks [copy]. Then I hear the sound of something being unplugged, him walking to pc2 and something being plugged in. He then right-clicks on the empty desktop and tries to press [paste]. Now it’s dawning on me...

$me can you tell me specifically what you just unplugged out of pc1 and into pc2?

$him what to you mean? The USB cable to my mouse. 

Turns out this guy thought that by right-clicking on the file and copying it, it would be stored on the mouse. He then unplugs the mouse and walks to the other pc to plug it in, only to discover his file had mysteriously disappeared.

754,Reset Does Not Equal Reboot,"The Players:

\~$Me \- Pretty obvious, it's me.

\~$Site \- A website, database, hosting, and associated services all wrapped into one.

\~$OldTech \- The previous owner and tech of the site, who ran the whole thing.

\~$NO \- New Owners of the site, trying to rebuild. Eager and Clueless.

Who am I?:

I'm me, obviously, I do freelance \(And usually unpaid\) basic IT work for my friends and acquaintances. Think, Virus removal, basic program issues, speeding up and bare\-level maintenance on machines. I was a user of $Site, and at the time had no experience with SQL, PHP, or the like... all of which will come into play.

Background:

$OldTech has \[THING\] requiring he drops out of $Site fully, leaving the site and server \(full access, dedicated host\) in the hands of $NO. Chaos Ensues.

The Story:

So this was a while ago, but I'm new around here so I'll do my best to recall it all as faithfully as I can. $OldTech has sudden events in their life, leaving them out of the loop fully on $Site. Until this point in time, the site's been buggy as hell, with errors everywhere. $OldTech had been trying to work on finding the source, but everything he did was causing more errors. However, due to his other events in his life, he has to leave. No contact whatsoever\- and leaving $NO in charge. $NO consists of a two\-person team, both with absolutely no experience in the matter and both very, very confident in their abilities, who are raring to go.

So go team, go enthusiasm. They do PR well, explaining what they can about $OldTech departing the site, and about them doing the best they can to pick up where he left off. Unfortunately, one of the more major issues flares up \(Issue with how PHP is sending information to the database, caused by out of date software and an utter refusal to update\) and the site crashes. More appropriately, the database just stops responding to queries due to some load limit that $OldTech setup, and so users are greeted with a blank white page, no data or error code or anything.

$NO, being the clueless but enthusiastic pair that they are, dive into the back of the server. They're able to get into the web dashboard, a glorified CPanel\-esque solution, and look through. To their credit, they found the PHP error log and diagnosed the issue as something with the database. As the hosting solution in play at the time was an unmanaged host, they don't pull in any professional techs or seek help from the userbase. They want to keep the impression they have things under control, and so don't let on to us they really have \*no idea\* what is going on. This leads to a conversation I can only assume went something like this between $NO 1 and 2:

\&gt;$NO1, over Skype: OK, so it looks like we have to restart the database or something. Is there a button that says 'Restart'?

\&gt;$NO2, looking at the web dashboard: Uhhhhhh.... yeah. Something like that. \*Click\*

\&gt;$NO1: In the database section, right?

\&gt;$NO2: Oops...

In the span of a few moments, from what it sounds like, Restart sounded a lot like Reset. As in, Format. With the push of one button, $NO had ordered the server to be wiped, including web files, databases, the Cpanel, and all other data pertaining to $Site. Gone. No backups, nothing. I later come to find out $OldTech hadn't taken any backups for over two years and had just been running one live copy. I know, Cringe.

So $NO almost immediately realizes what they just did, and look in vain for a way to fix it, including contacting the hosts directly. Alas, unmanaged means unmanaged, and their response was along the lines of ""Sucks to be you"", but of course I'm paraphrasing here. This is where $NO1 decides it's time to bring in extra help\- consisting of me. Somehow they knew I did a little tech support, and give me a call. They're calling from MST and I'm in EST, so this call is rather early in my morning. I then get what is so far one of the longest phone calls of my life, as they fill me in on what monster they have just created and finish with something to the effect of ""help plz"". Having nothing better to do in the near future, I agree to help them and ask for any information they have.

I get the following:

One Email address, no password

One Web Host account, with password

One Domain Management account, with password

Paypal account out of which to pay for whatever we need

The first thing I do is note that the password for the web host and the domain is the same. I try it on the email account and thank my lucky stars that the password policies were so bad. It's the same password, and I get in. However, this just begins what takes up my next week. I take inventory of what I have, and the tasks I have to complete.

1\) Find out how the site \*had\* been hosted up until the moment of deletion, including software, database type, and requirements

2\) Collect any assets I can find on the web \- Images, text, webpage files... you get the idea. Wayback machine becomes my friend, and I set $NO2 on the case, with very clear instructions. Success is moderate because about a year earlier $OldTech had banned all bots from the server, including the Wayback Machine's bots, meaning no archive exists of recent data. I am peeved.

3\) Begin to figure out for me WTH any of this stuff is. I've never seen anything like this before, and yet of the site users, I'm the most tech\-savvy. I inform $NO's about this, but they tell me to go ahead\- It's not like I can screw it up worse.

So I spend my day finding out all I need to know about web hosting and the software required. I also figure out that we were paying for a lot more than we needed\- a whole dedicated server might have been needed back when $Site was founded around the mid\-00's, but nowadays we could downsize significantly. I'm also not ashamed to admit I asked some pretty dumb questions on the internet, trying to figure out this stuff. By the next morning, I am able to figure out the software that was the forum host, Language \(PHP\), Database type \(SQL\), and minimum server requirements. I also find out, unfortunately, that without a proper SQL backup everything on the forum is lost and it'd be impossible to recover. They tell me they'll see what they can do and I head to bed.

Cue next morning. I log on and look at the chat log. They'd pulled some strings, and gotten in contact with a guy who knew $OldTech's sister, and through some arcane arts managed to acquire the last backup taken by $OldTech before his departure. I'm super psyched, and take a look at the file they send, after uploading it through Skype's horrible file transfer system. I then look at the filing date and die a little on the inside. XX/XX/2014. We've lost two years of data, from the time this database backup was taken, but according to $OldTech's sister, she'd talked to $OldTech and he'd not updated since then, because apparently ""The Updates Broke Things"". Also included is the critical assets\- logos, landing pages, etc. I ditch a lot of the junk data in the files, such as images and assets not used in approximately forever, and upload the database, 'hook it up' so to speak and finally get into the site, thank you StackOverflow. It's all working, albeit with a bunch of errors, a few thousand filling in a minute.

So, I begin to take it logically. I start by uninstalling every single modification on the server and restoring it to the 'core' version of the forum software. I also drop about a half\-dozen tables from the database, of information that is no longer used and should have been trashed a very long time ago when older mods were removed. I then make it a point to look at the version of the software the database was running on and that I have it running on. We'll call the current updated version X.14 and the version we were running... X.8. I dutifully inform $NO's about the status of what we have, and recommend to them that we try to update things now that older modifications have been removed. They greenlight the plan, and I begin to try and update. The update goes through fine, and I don't bother to ask why. I then begin to re\-add some of the modifications that let the site be how people like it. A lot of the modifications are out of date, so I chalk up all the errors to a sheer lack of maintenance and phobia of general maintenance.

Long story short, around five hours later I've implemented what I've figured to be a reasonable conclusion. $Site has been restored on a new host, with a \*religious\* backup scheme, which I perform every week and distribute to the now\-three person $NO team. I also have set up different passwords across the Email, Money, Domain, and Host accounts and require $NO's to change them every two months. Updates are also required, and new data integrity procedures were put in place. While we lost two years of data, the group has recovered remarkably well, and somehow they decided to keep me on as the head tech, despite as aforementioned not having known the first thing about the responsibility I had just inherited.

So that's the story of how I got started in working IT for people... and somehow took over a small web community's tech support in the process.

I use a remote connection to provide the vast majority of support. Life is good when I can jump onto a user's computer and actually viewing the screen to see exactly what error message is being displayed, or what button they are clicking or any of the other basic issues.

I ask only one thing of the users: they have to give me the workstation ID. It isn't hard to find, a shiny, bright, red, metallic sticker on the front of the machine with an ID number on it.

I can't count the number of times that I have to explain to users what a workstation ID is and where to find it.

757,"I mean, it's not technically wrong to set up your network this way, but...","Had this treat just last week. It was a good reminder to assume nothing, sometimes.

Cast of characters:  

* Speckled Spectacles (SS) is our intrepid agent, offering phone support for our next character:
* The Untechnical but Trying woman (UT). Really, that's all I can ask for from most people.
* And finally, the product, which I won't go into too much detail on. However, for it to work appropriately, it should be paired directly to your router (not through an extender), and will also only pair on 2.4 Ghz. For setup, we recommend making sure you connect back to 2.4 Ghz after using the hotspot (Usually doesn't matter, but on occasion we've seen it make a difference).

UT gave us a call, saying that she was working on setting up the product, but it kept saying it couldn't connect. Alright. I start going through my standard troubleshooting for when this happens. Part of that is getting the make and model of the router.

&gt;UT: I have a Netgear... Let me see if I can find the model number.  
&gt;SS: Usually, you'll see a technical information label on the back or bottom that has it listed. Did it come from your ISP?  
&gt;UT: Oh, there it is! C7000?  

So we're dealing with one of the few Netgear routers that are also modems. Okay. 

&gt;UT: There's also this Apple router? My husband set it up.

Oh, hmm. After some probing and testing, I started suspecting that the Airport wasn't actually set up.

&gt;SS: Would you like to try a quick test? Go ahead and unplug the Airport, and see if your network is still there.  
&gt;UT: Alright... Okay, it's still there on my computer, ""My Wi-Fi Network.""  
&gt;SS: Oh... Huh, it almost sounds like the Airport wasn't actually set up? Go ahead and leave it unplugged for now.  
&gt;UT: That's funny, we've noticed better speeds since we've gotten it...

I mean, that could well be placebo effect. Okay. So we try all of the fixes involving the phone and app, as well as the device itself, so all that's left is the router to look at. I guide her on how to log in to the router settings, intent on splitting up the networks (As there was no ""My Wifi Network-5,"" so to speak). 

&gt;UT: Oh, I see where it says SSID for 5 Ghz, but it says Netgear_81-5G?

Oh, what. For what it's worth, my support tools give the name of the connected SSID. It was definitely paired to ""My Wifi Network"". And I'd asked earlier about the networks she saw, even... Oh, oh no. I think I see where this is going, I just wasted time by having her unplug the Airport.

&gt;SS: Just to be sure, when you look at the list of wifi networks available, do you see Netgear_81?  
&gt;UT: Oh, yes, it's there!  
&gt;SS: Alright, thank you. Quick question. When you unplugged the Airport earlier, did you unplug power from it, or just the ethernet cord going from the Netgear to the Airport?  
&gt;UT: The ethernet cord.  
&gt;SS: Ah, so the Airport still has power. Okay. And you mentioned your computer still had internet, but then there's the ethernet cord connecting the computer to the Netgear... Well. Let's go ahead and plug that ethernet cord for the Airport back in. 

Fast forward a bit, we're looking through the Airport Utility on her Mac. Now, Apple is my biggest weakness. I'm not a fan of them, so usually, when I have to help someone do something on an iOS or MacOS device, I just Google it. The Airport's no exception, really. So I'm still considering the possibility that there's a band-steering issue going on and trying to temporarily split up the SSIDs to guarantee connecting to 2.4 Ghz. Poking through the settings, we check out the Network tab.

&gt;UT: It says the router mode is off, that it's in bridge mode?  
&gt;SS: I'm sorry, one more time?  
&gt;UT: There's three options on the dropdown here... DHCP and NAT, DHCP only, and Off (bridge mode). It's Off right now.
&gt;SS: Oh. Thank you. So...

Their topology looked like this:  
Coaxial cable &gt; Netgear modem/router combo (Handling DHCP and NAT, broadcasting networks) &gt; Apple Airport, two feet away from it, acting as a $200 ~~extender~~ wifi access point

**Setting** A client\-facing service desk, in the biggest municipal area for 120 miles in any direction. The city itself is constantly flooding, or choked in smog, or Imhotep\-level dust storms. Its boundaries are defined by the “loop”; a circular road on the edge of it. Everything out past the loop looks like a setting from a Mad Max movie. The general population is typically missing some sort of body part, and people usually have more fingers than teeth. Oil is the life\-blood of the land. And now, the players!!!

**$Me** – $8l4ck83rry

**$Joker** – second most experienced tech we have; when he starts laughing, he can’t stop, and it sounds IDENTICLE to “The Joker” as voiced by Mark Hammil

**$Pineapple** – the most experienced tech we have; the reason I got into IT to begin with

**$SnappleFacts** – Imagine if you had a Hefty bag filled with Snapple caps, then wished on it to be a tech; this would be the result. He’s \(both\) least experienced AND most senior tech we have; it’s not a perfect world

At this time in my career, I’m attached to an IT service desk, but \(strictly speaking\) I don’t IT. Instead, I do Operations, and I help out with the customer\-facing warm\-and\-fuzzy lip\-service/check\-in process you would come to expect of a retail giant. In fact, I’m quite new at this time, and I was determined to make a name for myself. Prior to this point, I learned a little bit of Chinese and Italian, but it all amounted to nothing more than what the obnoxious guy at a party does when he knows a dumb magic trick and feels lonely \(“HEY EVERYONE!!!

**$PokeTrainer**: Well, can you come out here and help me with this client? I can’t understand her.

**$Me**: Sure thing!

We walk out to the first desk \(yes, our help desk was a series of ACTUAL desks\) and there sits a woman with an expression on her face that is equally blank and worried \(idk how she did that\), staring unblinkingly at us, almost as if we should already be fixing her issue.

**$PokeTrainer** – Ok ma’ma, this is $8l4ck83rry, and he should be able to help you from here.

It should be noted that I didn’t find out from **$PokeTrainer** what was wrong to begin with.

\^ Mistake 2

**$Me**: Hi there! I’m $8l4ck83rry! How can I help you today?

**$MJ**: I want you help

\*struggles past bad grammar\*

**$Me**: You want me to help? Ok, with what?

**$MJ**: I want you help this.

\*Client holds up plastic grocery bag with something in it\*

**$Me**: Ok, I’d be happy to do that for you! What is it?

**$MJ**: I want you help this. Help computer.

The client then places the bag on the desk, and pulls a giant macbook from her tiny purse. Now, even more confused by the unexpected display of M. C. Escher physics I was just subjected to, I press on

**$Me**: Ok, is something wrong with the computer?

**$MJ**: Yes

**$Me**: Ok, what’s wrong?

**$MJ**: Fix it!

\*groans internally\*

**$Me**: Don’t worry, I will definitely fix this for you!

\^ Mistake 3; my fate, at this point, is sealed

After about 20 more minutes of back and forth, I finally find out why she brought the shopping bag. In it, she stuffed a corded POTS phone, with phone line, and a Magic Jack.

**$Me**: Ma’am, this is a Magic Jack.

\*Client looks at me like I’m from the moon\*

**$Me**: We don’t service this.

Realizing that she’s about to hear something that she doesn’t want to hear the client begins again.

**$MJ**: You fix!!!

**$Me**: I can check, but I’m pretty sure we don’t do this.

**$MJ**: You fix!!!

**$Me**: Ok, I’ll go check

Walks to workshop

**$Me**: We don’t service Magic Jacks, do we?

**$Pineapple**: No…

**$Me**: I thought not.

\*Heads back to client\*

**$Me**: No ma’am, we can’t help you with that.

**$MJ**: You fix!!!

This went on for about 30\~45 more minutes, ending with me finally able to get her out of the store. Afterwards, I head back to the workshop.

**$Snickers** &amp; **$PokeTrainer**: What was that about?

**$Me**: **$MJ** wanted me to setup a Magic Jack…

**$Snickers**: HAHAHA!!! WHAT?!?

**$PokeTrainer**: But we don’t do that! No one does that!

**$Me**: Yeah, I told her. That was kinda nuts.

Fast forward 2 days…

**$Snickers**: Hey $8l4ck83rry, there’s someone out here who wants to see you.

**$Me**: They asked for me by name?

**$Snickers**: Yeah! It’s **$MJ**, and she brought the Magic Jack with her again!

**$Me**: But I told her we don’t work on those!

**$Snickers**: \*incomprehensible laughter\*

**$Me**: Ok, I’ll go handle it.

I speak with **$MJ** again, and after spending another 40 minutes, I convince her that we cannot and will not service this device for her. I also look up and provide her with the customer service number for Magic Jack, and suggest that she call that number for help configuring the device. Afterwards, I walk back to the precinct.

**$DaleGribble**: What was that about?

**$Me**: A troublesome client. She keeps wanting us to service a Magic Jack.

**$Snickers**: \*starts a new round of incessant giggling\*

**$SnappleFacts**: I’m pretty sure we service that.

**$DaleGribble**: No. No we don’t. \*turns towards me\* Tell her to leave right now.

**$Me**: I already handled it. I think she got the point this time.

**$Joker**: Did you give her the customer service number?

**$Me**: Yeah. That’s all I could do.

**$Joker**: Ok, let me know if she comes back. I’ll handle it next time.

**$Me**: Thanks man.

**$Snickers**: \*doesn’t stop laughing\*

Fast forward \~ 1.5 weeks

I’m walking through the store, making my rounds in the different departments, trying to be helpful and learn as much as I can about everything, when **$TTJ** walks up to me.

**$TTJ**: Hey, got a minute?

**$Me**: Sure! What’s up?

**$TTJ**: There’s a client here that has an issue with a laptop battery. She speaks Chinese, and says that you helped her before.

**$Me**: \*not putting 2 and 2 together\* Ok, I’ll be right over!

Sure enough, its **$MJ** again, complete with giant macbook and shopping bag filled with everything as before. On seeing me, her appearance sinks a little, because she already knows what I’m going to say.

**$MJ**: Oh, hi. You fix? \*raises bag with corded phone and Magic Jack\*

**$Me**: No, sorry. We don’t service that. Have a nice day.

**$MJ**: Oh, ok.

759,"Uh, well if you're going to cut it I can't stop you.","I think this is the first time I am ever posting here and I read the rules and I think this could go here. However if I am an idiot I apologize and feel free to delete all my hard work!

So I am a contracted cable technician for a large very hated isp. I receive a work order labeled ""Special Request Order"" that is outside only and this job states that there is an above ground temporary cable and I should fill out a survey so the line can be dug underground.

Now how this usually works is there is an app that when I am onsite at the job and open the app it automatically fills out all the customer information with the job details and I just submit pictures and answer a couple of yes/no questions (Do we need to go across a driveway or need neighbor access stuff like that).

So I show up at 5:40pm (I am scheduled to work until 5pm but they gave me this job at 4:55 because it was a no time frame job) and I am SHOCKED at what I find. So there is a white cable coming from our box across the driveway of the house I was here to do the job for, but it did not go to that house. It went past the driveway, past the house, past the yard, past the neighbor's driveway to the side of the neighbor's house.

Due to the way the survey system works I can not submit a survey for his neighbor because I do not have a job for his neighbor. I go and knock on my job address's door and an old slightly overweight man comes to the door. I give him my greetings and explain the situation to him. He becomes incredibly irate because someone ran this line without his permission and its going across his property. He tells me the line needs to be removed NOW.

I call up my supervisor to explain what is going on and my supervisor tells me I can not cut the line because it could be providing phone service to his neighbor and if he needs emergency help his phone needs to be working. Customer overhears and says his neighbor is not home and he does not care and if I wont cut it then he will do it himself.  Since its his property I can not stop him so I have to wish him a good day and I pull away and see him coming out with a pair of shears.

Some notes: I am on mobile writing this on the way home so please excuse any grammatical or spelling errors. Also we are usually not allowed to run lines across other people's property without their consent. It seems a different isp was installing their lines and cut up a bunch of underground lines and the temporary line was ran due to this.",False,1572,271,Fearme4life,talesfromtechsupport
760,"""Don't order any upgraded equipment!""","About a year ago I was in charge of gathering required specs for computer needs and putting in an order for about 500 PCs, monitors, keyboards, mice, etc. for a new office building that was opening that my company manages. Being that I had already done this same quote for multiple buildings, I knew exactly what was needed. The standard PC build from our vendor comes with 4 gb ram. To run specific software, I have to include at minimum 8 gb, otherwise the computer all but stops working. When making the build through our vendor the additional 4 gb of ram only runs us an extra $26. I put the quote together and sent it off to our budgeting department for final approval and ordering. Within the hour I received the following emails from the head of budgeting.

Him: I see you included an extra charge of $26x500 for computer memory?

Me: Yup. We need it to run X software.

Him: Will it run without the extra memory?

Me: Not well

Him: We are already over budget. Don't order any upgraded equipment! Just get the basic stuff.

After trying to explain why it was important several times, why the software won't run...

Me (not in the mood to deal with his crap anymore): Sure thing. I will get that quote for you right away.

So I revised the order without the memory and sent it back to him. A few weeks later, the computers get delivered and are set up in the new offices. I get them all imaged with the software over the weekend and ready to go. First thing Monday morning I come in to a frantic slew of emails about how the specialized software won't run and nobody can do their job. After a few back-and-forth emails with the COO I sent the full email chain with jackass explaining what happened. I am told to immediately put in an order for the extra memory, have it delivered as soon as possible, and get it installed immediately.

By ordering the memory separately instead of installed initially at $26 per we had to pay an extra $50,000 ($128 per memory stick because we have a horrible non-compete vendor). Not only that, but I got a ton of overtime and the company lost out on a weeks worth of productivity. All in all, the company probably lost close to $200,000 if not more.

761,How do I make my password red?,"Here's just a quick story that just happened a minute ago of me being the family tech support.  
Not too long ago I installed a password manager for my mom, since before that she just wrote all her passwords and logins down in a booklet.  
She's been mostly happy with it, but sometimes she comes to me for help when she's having trouble copy pasting it.   

Here's the dialogue of that conversation: 
&gt;mom: I can't copy paste it again, you said the apple password was the same as the icloud one right?  

&gt;me: Yeah that's right, but they are asking for the password of your email, you see?  

&gt;mom: Ah great now it works, thanks. Luckily too, because I didn't have any idea how to make my password red.

&gt;me: Wait what do you mean making your password red?

&gt;mom: Look here, these letters are red and the other ones aren't, I don't know how to type red.

&gt;me: Oh mom no, that's because those characters are numbers and the others ones aren't. It's to make it less confusing when there's an o or an 0.

763,On the subject of mentoring...,"Reading the tale by u/Theory_of_Steve reminded me of a similar mentoring tale from my days of helpdesk.
( https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8mc9ue/training_my_replacement/ )

Background: tier 1 helpdesk supporting tax software, for both the online site and as a purchasable suite. Some of us got the 'privilege' of having other people buddied to us for them to listen to our calls as a training tool. Generally this went fine. However..

Enter: I honestly can't remember her name, but picture the typical ""I want your manager"" hair bob attached to someone old enough to be my mother. 

Hair-bob: T for Trainee
Me: Some asshole.

Here I am, going about my normal call routine. Had just wrapped a session of buddying, and T was to be the second one for that day. T sits, gets buddied in, and I go to take my first call.

&gt; Caller rings, introduces self, goes ""I can't find my (proprietary software item) from last year!""

Now, this is common - accounts are free, person very likely made an account previously, and is now in the wrong account while trying to find it. happens daily. 

In the middle of first question to verify caller, T interrupts
&gt;T: Oh ask him how long he's used us! Maybe hes using the wrong company. Or maybe he never did it before!

Not quite..

I nod at T, and go back to trying to verify caller. I make it another two lines or so before T is poking me (literally) in the arm. We mute again.

&gt;T Ask him what other sites he used!

Nope...

I unmute and start my normal questions to prompt the caller to remember the other account (a literal Hey you made another one instead of going back to the other)

T is poking me again.

I mute, and ask yes?

&gt;T How do you know he has another account? 

I look at T and politely ask:

&gt;Me: Well, this is what I do. This is the most common thing we fix. Please let me assist him and you'll see how. 

&gt;T: Ugh. I can't believe you can't just tell me. 

&gt;Me: Well. You're sitting with me to learn, but I'd be happy to switch over and let you finish the call out if you think you can do this better.  (mind you, not the great way to handle it, but having been literally jabbed in the arm prior....)

T rips her headset off, and gets up to leave while saying how awful I am. Later, my managers flag me over and to ask about what happened. I recount my side, and get told Alright, we'll take care of it. 

I didn't hear another word about it for about a week, until...

I come into work, and start to head up (our call center was 2nd floor, had a boxed staircase to go up to it) and hear shouting. Turning the corner, I see two training managers, security, and T with T shouting she can't believe this shit, how dare they let her go, she can't believe they'd treat her like this, etc

I glance at the manager while walking up, and say nothing. About 20 minutes later into my shift, I get an e-mail: ""We tried to critique her after she was reported as being rude, it did not go well.""

764,Training my replacement,"I'm finally getting off of the service desk. For 3 years I have been working as Tier 1, while my advanced skillset is melting away in the corners of my mind. On Monday, I start my new role in File Services/Access (hooray!).

I've been training my replacement on the Service Desk. I swear, management only hired this kid to ensure maximum stress on my way out. He doesn't listen. He's an end-user who now has admin credentials and is going to be supporting other end-users. I'm terrified for the future of the Service Desk, but I guess it's not going to be my problem anymore.

I'm going to list out some of my gripes about the new kid:

- 20 years old, is so preoccupied with his phone. I always thought that it was a stereotype about young people. Nope, this kid is the living embodiment of mobile phone addiction. The first day I was training him he was sitting with me, supposed to be watching what I was doing so he could at least get a feel for the environment. He could hear the calls and clearly see everything on both of my screens. He was sitting a little behind me because of space constraints. Every single time I glanced over my shoulder he was staring at his phone screen. *Every*. *Single*. *Time*. I mentioned to him a couple of times that he should be watching what i'm doing, and he would always perk up and smile and project confidence and watch intently... But after a couple of minutes he was just staring at his phone again. I didn't hound him to watch my screen. I'm not babysitting.

- After a couple of days of him ""Shadowing"" me, I decide it's time for him to put what he's learned to use. We trade places. When I told him that he was going to be controlling the computer he turned white as a ghost. Literally trembling. Teeth chattering. He doesn't know where anything is or what anything does. I have my windows arranged cleanly so that everything that he needs is available at a glance. As soon as he sits down he starts idly moving the windows around without paying attention to what he's doing. I tell him to stop - if he moves these windows he's not going to be able to find them later. Everything he needs is visible already, so there's no need to move anything. A call comes in. He totally botches the greeting. Here's how it goes... 
&gt; NEW KID:""...(dead air, he's clicking on something)...""

&gt; USER: ""... Hello?""

&gt; NEW KID:""...Uh..."" (clicking sounds resume) *at this point i tap the page in his notebook where he wrote down the greeting he wanted to say*

&gt; NEW KID: ""Oh uh... Thanks for Service Desk. Hello. This is the service desk. Hello. Uh... Whats wrong?"" (this isn't even close to what was written on the page)

&gt; USER: (long sigh of frustration)

Eventually he gets to the end of the call. Thank god it was just an easy account unlock. By the end of the call all of my neatly organized windows have been scattered to the f-ing wind by this kid idly clicking and dragging them around.

- He doesn't know where anything is. He keeps losing his windows. He keeps forgetting that Windows 10 has separate taskbars for each monitor. He is always looking at the left-screen's taskbar, looking for icons for windows that are open on the right screen. He double-clicks them when he find them, then looks at me puzzled why the window keeps opening and then closing immediately. Sweat is appearing on his brow.

- Day 2. He gets a call that requires him to connect to a user's PC. I've been telling him that he doesn't always need to have the answer right away. Tech support rarely has a solution immediately. I've been telling him to get the users to demonstrate the problems that they are experiencing so that we can determine what the cause might be. So he's on this user's computer, and he asks the user to show him what the problem is. The user takes hold of the mouse and tries to show him what the problem is, but New Kid still has his hand on his own mouse, and is just idly moving it a little bit, which makes the cursor on the user's screen snap back to the last location that the tech had it in. So the user can't control his mouse. I'm watching this, aghast. The user says ""I can't move my mouse for some reason"", and the New Kid kind of nods and repeats back ""you can't use your mouse"", all the while, still with his hand on his own mouse, making tiny unintentional movements. I lean in and tell New Kid ""Take your hand off the mouse"". He loudly repeats to the user ""Take your hand off your mouse"". *Forehead Slap*. ""No, no, New Kid, take YOUR hand off YOUR mouse. It's moving the user's cursor around and he can't control."" New Kid, now *extremely* confused says to the user ""No, no, you can't move your mouse. Take your hand off. You can't control."" *Forehead Slap x1000*. I reach over and physically remove the New Kid's hand from his mouse. The whole time he's saying things like ""Uh. Um. Oh. Mouse"" over the phone, and the user is now extremely confused. I reach across the desk and punch the mute button on the phone. I say to new kid ""You can't move your mouse while the user is trying to use it, because it makes the cursor snap back to it's last position. If you tell the user to show you what the problem is, then you need to let them control the mouse. If you're moving the mouse, the user can't move it on their end."" **A flash of understanding**. Phone taken off mute. He apologizes to the user for the confusion, repeats instruction to show him what the problem is. New Kid then idly places his hand back on the mouse, giving it a little bump. Still making micro unintentional movements. User can't control mouse still. *Forehead slap so hard retinas detatch*.

I'm sure he'll get better with time, but early indications are bleak. I have more, but i've written so much that I think i should stop.

TL;DR - New Kid is frustratingly incompetent.",False,539,120,Theory_of_Steve,talesfromtechsupport
765,Streaming services require internet,"I worked in customer support for a streaming service for a while. One of my most baffling calls was with a grumpy old man. He was clearly dubious that I could help him, so it was difficult to get answers or useful info out of him. We spent the first five minutes with me slowly dragging info out of him (""It's not working,""--""Okay, what happens when you *try* to open the program/website?""-- ""It doesn't work."") 

Once I finally ascertained that this was an internet related error, I mentally weight trying to walk Mr. Grouch through the steps that are supposed to come before unplugging the router, and decided to skip it. I directed him to unplug the router, being sure to describe what I meant in the most basic of terms (""You probably have a large or small box with blinking lights that someone might have helped you install in order to get internet."", etc) But he was adamant that he did not possess a router--or internet, for that matter. 

Bear in mind that this guy had an account with us, his name and billing information and email had all been confirmed. I had every reason to believe that he in fact did have a router/internet, yet he kept insisting he did not have internet or a router. I spent ten minutes trying to figure out a way to communicate so that he'd understand (""do you have cable tv?""; ""do you get a bill from [provider in his area]?""; ""Do you have any children who helped you set up [streaming service], can you call them?""). 

This dude was adamant--he had no kids, he paid for nothing but utilities and property tax, he just wanted me to fix his damn Streaming service. 

Finally, I went into a thorough ELI5 explanation of how the internet works and why he needs to have it in order for his streaming service to work. I explained to him that I found it very hard to believe that he didn't have internet at all, considering his streaming service had been working up until recently. At this point, We understood each other. It was clear there was no miscommunication. He did not have internet, and never had. He had set up the streaming service initially while at work, but had been able to use it at home for years.

He wanted to know why, if he'd never had internet, he'd been able to watch the service for so long. He was always watching on a laptop computer--I said my very best guess is that he'd been picking up someone's WiFi from next door, but to be honest I was as lost as him. If he really did not have internet (I was even then still doubtful) then the streaming service was not going to work. 

He hung up angry, I hung up frustrated and burning with curiosity. I still wonder if he really didn't have internet.

First time posting with the new design, hope I will not screw up to hard.

$me: you guess what? its me!

$cw: my good coworker

$boss: my boss

The Setting:

Its a robot tale, so I am working with industrial robots and everything around them.

I get a work\-order from $boss which states something like this:

\&gt;$boss: Go to $cu and make changes to the programm, you know this application is not finished yet and there are a few difuculties with the customer and the timeframe, but you will work that out.

Nice... That is not really the truth. The truth is that we are 6 Mo behind shedule, we changed everything of the concept and components, we didnt communicate well with the customer and we have no idea how to get everthing running, and the main problems are mechanical. $boss told $cu that when I go home after this service everything will work perfectly.

So $cw and $me are on the way to $cu and discuss the problem. we both come to the same conclusion: it will not work, we will get in the crossfire between $cu and $boss and that it will end bloody.

We arrive and are greeted by $cu:

\&gt; $cu: hey guys, $boss told us everything is set up, now start the production, we have parts ready for you!

\&gt; $cw: hey $cu, uhm... sorry, but ... we are here for a test run and for optimization, we can not start the real production,

we will not be able to reach the cycle time and we have to stop now and then to kill a bug or two.

3...2...1... booom $cu went through the roof

\&gt; $cu: but $boss told me you only have to run it, make what ever need and change what you want, but the robot has to run all the time and it has to make parts, you can not stop it for every reason.

\&gt; $me: sorry $cu, but it is not how this all works... we have to do it that way, everything else will not really get us further.

\&gt; $cu: i dont care, do it like I tell you and like I communicated it with $boss

I've got a decade worth of stories that now I am log gone from there I can start to share.  Everything from completely illogical power supply switch installations to many and varied staff requesting bizarre things becasue they think ""IT Staff"" translates to ""Wizard who can fix everything from the coffee machine to the Vacuum cleaner""!!  

This particular story is from around 7 year ago \(I know, an actual eternity in IT terms\) and features one of the most heroic attempts at accidentally breaking something I had ever seen.

Our cast:

&gt;**$ME** A lowly level 1 tech at the time \- plenty of experience and knowledge but hamstrung buy the IT Manager's need to make himself indispensable.    
&gt;  
&gt;**$FT** A friendly computer studies teacher who was lovely to talk to but impossible to deal with once out of her comfort zone.    
&gt;  
&gt;**$TAP** Our lovely new apprentice  
&gt;  
&gt;**$ITM** The IT Manager

The setup:

&gt;For... let's just say reasons... when we received a request a year or so previous to this story happening to allow students access to Ruby, the decision was made to give students a small VM to run the software on.  **$ITM** was the only person that ever knew the correct combination of duct tape and WD\-40 used to keep it working and never let us techs even look over his shoulder when fixing things just in case.    
&gt;  
&gt;Now,  **$ITM** is on annual leave and we get the call...

**$ME** Hello, IT. TerrifiedRedneck speaking.

**$FT** Please come up to $Class ASAP. I planned a lesson with $Ruby and it worked fine last week. Today it doesn't work!

**$ME** \(*kinda thinking ""yeah, right, last week, whatever""*\) No worries. Is it on all the computers, some, or just yours?

**$FT** All the PCs. I've had students move and everything and it still isn't working. Please Help!

Admittedly, at this point I panicked. This software and it's setup is completely alien to me and I don't want to let the teacher or her class down.  **$ITM** always said that if there was an issue I could ring or text him. But my stubbornness and want of his job at some point always stopped me from doing that.

I was considering it here though.  

I grab **$TAP** and we head to the top floor of a five storey building \- We were across the campus, not even in the same building.  

Sure enough, we get in to the classroom and **$FT** is in full headless chicken mode.

**$FT** I don't know what's going on, I talked to **$ITM** last week and it as fine

**$ME** Ok, lets see if the problem is immediately fixable. 

Meanwhile I get **$TAP** to login as himself \(all IT Tech accounts were DA's at this point. I know, I know, as soon as I could, It wasn't a thing anymore\). Nope, he can't make it work either.  

**$ME** Right, yeah, something here isn't right. 

Through a series of clever pulleys and levers, I RDP onto my office machine so I can troubleshoot in the room without being hindered by the lack of tools on the machines.  It occurs to me, i know so little about this installation, I don't even know where it's installed.  Right... Let's take a butcher's.

I send **$TAP** back to the office to switch on his machine. Low and behold, I get a call five minutes later and things start to come to life. I could not believe it.  

**$FT** was suitably impressed, **$TAP** got the credit \(he did fix it after all\) and I magically solved the issues of the broken Ruby installation, the broken license server for some music software that was broken for the same reason \(but no one spotted or reported it yet\) AND why **$ITM**'s PC would randomly slow to a speed similar to pensioners humping all while he was on holiday!

768,Whose name should I sign?,"Hi, long time reader of TFTS, and I have a few stories locked away in my tiny brain. This one  happened yesterday.   
 
I work in retail as an in-store technician. Mostly variations on ""have you tried turning it off then on again?"" type of stuff. One of the things we are required to do is to ensure that the same person dropping off a laptop is the one picking it up. Legally it has to be the same person signing the paperwork at drop off and pickup. With no ability to designate a secondary individual. 
   
A customer comes is and arranged a pickup appointment. I'm in the back getting the laptop in question. The name is an obvious male name but a female customer is standing at the counter. It turns out that this is the customer's mother. 
 
I explain that I can't release the device to her as she's not the name on the paperwork. She just flips her shit saying that she hasn't been told that this was what was required. Nothing I say changes her mind. She's demanding to find out who gave her incorrect information.   
 
I end up having to bring a manager who is having worse luck explaining. She's not leaving until she gets her son's laptop. The manager ends up saying yes because he's tired of this lady's shit. He explains to her that we are breaking legalities to accommodate her and that this is a one time exception.  
 
At this point I hold out the paperwork to her and ask her to sign.  
 
Angry mother: Whose name should I sign?   
  
Me: You should sign your name since signing your son's name would be considered forgery. 
 
She signs it and takes her son's computer.

You need to evacuate now.,"Got a call early this morning from someone who showed up extremely early at their branch. They were looking to log into the system and add 2-3 files onto the loan they were writing.

&gt; $ME - Thanks for calling the help desk. 

&gt; $HC - Yeah my internet doesnt work at my office this morning. Its really early and I need to file these w2s for the underwriters. 

&gt; $ME - OK run me through what you have done so far and I will know where to start from there. 

&gt; $HC - Well... I uh... I called you?

&gt; $ME - *Laughs* Ok lets head to your network room and just unplug everything, wait about 30 seconds and plug it back in. 

*10 minutes later*

&gt; $HC - Yeah its still only showing 1 green light. 

&gt; $ME - Yeah will need to put in a ticket with your local ISP. Give me your address please. 
 
She gives me her address and I look it up. 

&gt; $ME - Umm. Thats in Hawaii. UMM BRO Thats on the island of Hawai'i. The one with the volcano. 

&gt; $HC - Yeah I know. You think that has anything to do with it?

&gt; $Me - Yeah I think lava definitely would definitely be the cause of your internet issues. Are you in the path of the ash cloud?

&gt; $HC - Doubt it. 

&gt; $Me - Yeah you should probably evacuate. You cant do anything from where you are anyways as the volcano has cut off your internet. (Legitimately my favorite sentence I have ever said.) If not evacuate, get everyone you know, and your dog, ready to evacuate. 

She laughed a bit and sighed. 

&gt; $HC - You really think its that dangerous?

&gt; $ME - Umm yes. Then again I am not there and can not make a judgement call for you. That being said, I highly doubt that your isp will be able to service this until the volcano goes dormant again. Recommend working from home being ready to evacuate. Would also letting everyone else in your office know that your office is closed for the time being. But that is just my suggestion. 

&gt; $HC - So nothing you could do on your end to fix it?

&gt; $ME - Unfortunately I do not have those kinds of abilities. Yet.

770,"No! We dinosaurs use STONE tablets, thank you. (The Aftermath)","So gonna skip the long into, this is in response to several people asking for a followup on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8m1tl1/no_we_dinosaurs_use_stone_tablets_thank_you/) story. My generic intro is there, so I will jump right on in!

This will be done in story format, speaking roles will be $Me, as myself, $VP as the apparently pretty cool VP of my branch, $BB as Big Boss, also known as my boss. All other roles will be played by $SN for snarky manager(s). 

So the thread basically exploded today. A whole host of $SNs were crawling on this from start of day til the time I walked out. Nothing was directed at me in the e-mail chain after about 8-9 am so my attention was purely educational. 

At the start, it was focused around making sure the office was happy. Obviously the owner was displeased that 'nothing was fixed', and this is a high profile office. Much hemming and hawwing was done. Discounts were discussed, comped on site services, alll sorts of goodies for owner. I'm sure he was pleased. 

And then... everything changed when the fire nati- Err. Wrong story. After around lunch, the tone of the entire chain shifted. Apparently, Owner had become furious about... something. It was never actually said, but he apparently called in to his local $SN fuming. Theen it came down to blame. Who setup $OMs account? (the office). Who did $OMs job training? (the office). Who did the office purchase their car from ?!?!? (Idk... Honda, probably?) That wasn't an actual question asked, but that was the gist of this hour of the e-mail chain. Finally, they hit the question. THE question. ""Well, who worked with them yesterday?"". I'm not sure how, but I could feel people from multiple states all somehow triangulate on me and turn to look in my direction. 

What followed was fun chain of people chiming in that led to this exchange (note: words are reorganized and changed for anonymity but tone and subject are accurate).

&gt;$SN1: Well, I think we have nailed down the source of the problem. Now it's just how we decide to proceed from here. We have enough people that I'm sure who can come to a satisfactory decision. 

&gt;$SN2: I agree. We have already started talks with $Owner on what he feels would be acceptable to resolve this situation and another 'poor unfortunate soul' will be calling the office Tuesday to continue. 

&gt;$SN3: That is good to hear, but I feel that we haven't discussed the real issue properly. This was a failing on our parts, and especially on the part of $ITOverlord. From talking to $Owner, if this is the kind of support we we feel is acceptable to be offering, then I believe any parties involved should be seriously looked into for re-training on our core company values. $BB, I'm sure you will provide a satisfactory explanation on how you will be handling this. 

&gt;$VP: It has become apparent to me that we have people involved in this incident who have failed to properly research into this issue enough to make an informed decision on how this should be handled. I'm going to be stepping in to take over, and ending this email chain. Now. After this e-mail any further complaints or thoughts on this subject WILL go directly to me. I agree with the several sentiments expressed in this chain. This is a great learning opportunity for everyone in this recipients list. I mean, everyone. There are multiple recordings attached to this thread showing one of our employees working with a difficult situation and being professional, efficient, and pleasant throughout. $ITOverlord displayed large amounts of patience, understanding, and flexibility despite being faced with sometimes open hostility. Myself and $BB already discussed how we feel he handled this situation, and other than the fact that he should of extricated himself from it sooner felt that he handled it well. I will be calling the office myself on Tuesday to discuss how this was handled with Owner personally. 

I could hear the pins drop from around the world. I adopted the smuggest grin I could muster, walked into my last meeting for the day with $BB and got told, very succinctly and seriously that I was to act humbled and grateful, with 0% of my usual lackadaisical charm if ANYONE talked to me about this. 

As it turned out, VP had apparently started reaming everyone. I was painted as a serious and straitlaced tech (...sorta true) who always excelled in customer service (very true) and was basically used  as a bludgeon against a lot of the $SNs in the chain. $BB and $VP had been the two to actually listen to the recording, and I am probably going to have to answer some questions and have my ticket scrutinized (yay for good notes). 


So yeah. Not a 100% clean end, but very satisfying. I also got permission to post this followup (and to keep the OG thread open) so double clear!

I recently moved into IT work for one of the larger Payroll companies in the United States, and was recently told this story and given permission to post it here. My mentor, let's call him $goose received a call from one of our older users requesting some support.

I wasn't there for this so the exact conversation is unknown, but based on the story told, I like to imagine the conversation went something like this \(note, overall content is as it was shared, small details are embellished\):  


**$goose**: Thank you for calling $supportTeam, may I have your name and a callback number in case we are disconnected?

**$user**: Yes my name is $user and my callback number is $phoneNumber.

**$user**: Sure, I'm working from home today, so let me know if there's a glare and I can close the blinds.

772,"No! We dinosaurs use STONE tablets, thank you.","Hey all, back again with a fun one. This happened yesterday, and its slow this morning so may as well throw this up. 

As usual, quick background, I work for a company that handles IT for most offices in a single industry. There is sometimes data sensitive enough for there to be legal enforcement of it, so we are veeery careful on how we do our network and server setups. We have standardized equipment, IP schemes, naming processes etc. Very very meticulous and enforced for good reason. We have multiple levels of techs with varying skills (ranging from basic entry level IT work, to handling 20+ offices for a single company and having personal knowledge of terminal servers and etc. for those specific offices). My role mostly involves managing our internal portal, creating programs and utilities for employees/management, and being tagged in when something is juuust below 'Level 3' clearance to make sure it really needs to hit that high. With all that in place lets begin!



So the day starts as usual, roll into the office, stare longingly at the coffee bar, wondering once again why I quit that sweet sweet caffeine, before sighing and taking my place at my desk. Things are going well, we are nearing a holiday weekend so it's pretty slow which leaves our high level techs available to help out the lower levels as problems arise, which gives me time to knock out some bug fixes, and continue slamming my head against a wall of SQL development issues I've been working on for a while. 

Which is why it was surprising that, as I tried to glare a PostgreSQL database out of existence, someone started to knock on my desk. I decided not to risk my latent existence wiping powers spontaneously manifesting on this poor level 1 tech, and putting on my best co-worker smile ask what I can help with. I'll spare the long drawn out explanation, but the gist is that a high profile office had requested me specifically to help with a problem. They had recently hired a new office manager, and she was having all sorts of problems. I pull up the account info, notice that I had worked with them on a huge escalation case before, hence the specific request, and then check my e-mail. Which I regret immediately. 

See, my initial plan to tag in a level 3 or 4 tech (which is the normal procedure with these kinds of offices and situations) is immediately shattered, as I notice an email chain, 13 messages deep, with the recipients having all kinds of fun acronyms, starting at the local management letters and ending at... Branch VP. And of course, the last email in the chain is ""ITOverlord, with as much as you wowed this office last time you worked with them, we expect this time to be no different!""... from the VP. 

I start cursing... basically every entity I can, and ready myself to work with the office. Setting the stage now $Me, will be yours truly, $OM will be the beast from ancient times, the new office manager, and $CO will be the pleasant, but entirely clueless owner of the office. 


I put on my best customer service pants (the ones with the elastic removed from the waistband), and give the office a call. 

&gt;$Me: Hey $CO! Just reaching out to see if we can fix the issues $OM is having for you! What's going on?

&gt;$CO: Oh! $Me, thank god! We just hired $OM, her training period ended and she has no access to anything! She says she is having trouble logging in, viewing reports, heck she hasn't even been able to clock in! We want this fixed as soon as possible, because we hired her as a ringer to deal with some of the issues we've been having. We need to leverage her experience as soon as possible, so please get this fixed quick!

&gt;$Me: No worries $CO! I completely understand, give me her info and I'll get to the bottom of this fore you!

So I go to it, I get her info, pop into the DC... and find no issues. Her account is setup with all the privileges and part of all the groups it should be. I remote into an unused workstation, use the creds and boom. No problems. I check their Office software. She's setup as a manager, can pull reports, has printer access, can use the B2B vpn tunnels to the other locations fine... Weird. I jump into HER workstation, maybe its new and things are missing, or its local policies inexplicable went crazy? Nope. Everything works how it should, all functionality as normal. Through this entire process I've been trying to reach $OM, but she wasn't at her desk (couldn't reach her by extension), and apparently wasn't even on her floor according to the random employee I rang to tap her on the shoulder for me. Finally, I give $CO a call, get $OMs cell number after he fails to page her, and ring her up. 

&gt;$Me: Hi $OM! This is $ITOverlord, from $Company, I'm working on your tick-

&gt;$OM: FINALLY, god I have too much to do to be dealing with this crap. Did you get the problems fixed?

&gt;$Me: Well, I looked into it and couldn't find any issues with your accounts or your comp-

&gt;$OM: Liar!

Now... I'm a very reasonable, chill individual. But this took me by surprise. I felt a vein a thought didn't exist anymore pop up on my forehead, both by the tone, and the fact that her voice sounded like sandy winds from a lost time blowing and rasping through catacombs long since forgotten. You know in 'The Mummy' when it firsts resurrects and is speaking while spitting out sand? Like that, but angry and spiteful. 

&gt;$Me: I'm... sorry?

&gt;$OM: Liar. You didn't talk to me about my problems at all. You couldn't have looked into anything! 

&gt;$Me: Well... I spoke with $CO, and had him explain what was going on... then looked into the issues he told me about. I tried to reach you but you weren't at your desk or on your floor...

&gt;$OM: Of course not! What's the point of sitting there if nothings working, I've been in the break room!

Now... I've been working on all this for over an hour at this point. So she has been sitting in the break room... doing nothing, and ignoring the owners pages... for over an hour. 

&gt;$Me: ...Alright, well lets go ahead and get you back there so you can show me what's going on. 

&gt;$OM: *grumbles some ancient curse and makes her way there* Alright, I'm here. Fix it.

&gt;$Me: Of course, let's just get you to log-

&gt;$OM: I can't login it doesn't work. Watch. 

I proceed to spend about five minutes watching her type in everything BUT her username as she tries to get access before taking over and getting her logged in myself. This led to a good 20 minutes argument about what her username was, which I will omit for time and sanity... 

&gt;$Me: Alright, no go ahead and show me what's happening when you try to do anything...

&gt;$OM: I can't nothing looks right and nothing works...

Now... I remember this conversation vividly. For one, it was yesterday, and for two, it is the single most frustrating conversation I've ever had. In my life. And I have five younger siblings. Just thinking about it this morning is making me angry, but reliving it is a bit too much. The gist of it, is that at her old place of employ, they used an older office suite (2003 I came to learn), didn't use $OfficeSoftware, or any industry standard. They didn't have a domain. They used personal email addresses. As it turns out, the office did just about everything manually. As in, on paper. Which is how she expected things to happen here. From how she described things, I also suspect the two (yes two) pcs in her old place of employ to have been windows XP as well...

I spent a solid hour in a constant state of being griped at before I was finally able to wrap it up, ending with this fun exchange...

&gt;$Me, struggling to keep from quite literally exploding: Well, unfortunately $YourCompany has been setup like this for a while so you will need to learn how these systems work. If you need we can setup a training tim-

&gt;$OM: No! Now you listen here. I've been doing this job longer than you've been alive. 58 years. I know what I'm doing, and how things SHOULD be done. You go talk to $CO and get this fixed!

I was then promptly, and thankfully, hung up on. I took a few minutes. Did a lap, stared longingly at coffee, considered a liquor run, contemplated life some, before I finally called $CO. He was expecting me. 

&gt;$CO: Heeey $IT, just got done talking to $OM and I'm a little disappointed... You've spent a lot of time on this, and from what she tells me nothings been fixed. She said you were being quite rude even. What's going on? Do we need to talk to (Mid level manager)?

&gt;$Me: Hey $CO, I think we do actually. We should also pull in (Upper regional manager) as well. 

&gt;$CO, sounding very displeased that I didn't cow: ...Oh? Well what's going on. 
&gt;$Me: **Proceeds to explain in detail the call, from start to finish** Obviously, I don't expect you to just believe me, so I'll send you our calls recordings, of course. 

&gt;$CO: That sounds quite a bit different than what I heard. I'm sure a lot of it is just misunderstandings on her part, so you really should just be patient with her. She's pushing 100 you know. 

&gt;$Me: Oh? I wouldn't have guessed. Like discussed, I'll send the recordings and email (relevant managers) for you. Expect those to come in the next hour or so. 

So I did. I pulled recordings, typed up the e-mail, sent it and then walked to the highest power I had access to in my office. I sat in a nice comfy chair as he looked at my confusedly, watching as he got, then read my e-mail, and had a niiice long conversation. Apparently, several others had read it as well as by the time I got back to my desk there was a chain exploding. 

So here I sit, chuckling and rolling my eyes at a few vaguely insulting/threatening e-mails, knowing full well that only two people listened to the recording. Luckily one of those is the Branch VP, who already assured me (via e-mail no less) that I handled things as good as anyone could be expected to and not to worry. I'm not sure if he is in today due to holiday weekend, but either way I get a bit of amusement while once again trying to glare PGSql out of existence.",False,1083,104,ITOverlord,talesfromtechsupport
773,Schroedinger's Software Licensing,"When you fall into a routine, time gets away from you.

There haven't been any crazy issues for a while. We had a rash of users unable to open their desktop $BSS apps, but otherwise, everything has been ridiculously routine.

**QUICK REMINDER**: I work as a phone tech for a small company, recently acquired by a slightly larger company, that contracts with a big software company, to provide support for their big software suite ($BSS).

On the side, I fix the occasional PC, keep up my own vehicle (which I just spent a month chasing down a pernicious short in the blinkers, only fixed by replacing an entire taillight), and generally keep to myself (when I got my own space, I **reveled** in my newfound solitude).

Lots of changes at work have kept me busy: team restructuring, training, new passwords for the software we use to troubleshoot and take tickets, new software for taking tickets... it's all been a bit of a blur.

When I finally got something interesting, though, my firstthought was, ""Something worthy of TFTS! It's about time!""

    Ticket title: Can't activate $BSS

According to their profile, the company was located in Canada. It put a big smile on my face.

(Quick aside: I love dealing with Canadians and people from the UK. They are unfailingly polite, patient, and willing to work as carefully to fix their issue as needed. Everyone else is hit or miss.)

I called the number, and a woman answered the phone.

&gt;Me: Good morning, this is {molotok.getName();}, how may I help you this morning?

&gt;$Bubbly Canadian Admin ($BCA... this works twice, as she mentioned she was originally from Vancouver): Oh, hi! Thank you for calling so quickly! I've been doing okay for a while, and then today, I got this error!

We set up a screen-share, and sure enough... ""This is an unlicensed product, yadda yadda...""

We navigated into the account details, and again, there was a big red box saying ""license expired.""

However, when I checked on the account, the subscription was up to date, in good standing, paid up... nothing should have been wrong.

&gt;Me: Okay, go to this link (*I sent a link to an activation troubleshooter in the chat that came with the screen share*) and run that. It should tell us where the issue is.

&gt;$BCA: Okay! Cool! I'll do that!

After a quick download, and going through the entire process...

&gt;Troubleshooter: Product is already activated.

...wait... what?!?

&gt;$BCA: Wow... that's not right, is it?!

&gt;Me: No... no, it's clearly not.

On that same page she had opened from the link was another, more in-depth troubleshooter. I had her run that...

&gt;Big Troubleshooter: Product already activated.

No... no it's... wait...

&gt;Me: Go back to that app we looked at before... I want to look at something...

&gt;$BCA: Okay! Let's do that!

We navigated to the account details. Right above the big red error box, there was a small link: ""Click here for additional license details.""

&gt;Me: Please click on that...

&gt;$BCA: Sure!

In that link, we saw another license.

It was activated, all right. And not activated at the same time.

&gt;Me: That's... new.

&gt;$BCA: Oh... I think I had a home account on here before, and I must have activated this as the business account when the home one ran out!

&gt;Me: Maybe. I will admit, I have never seen this before.

(Side note: I probably will see it again. I really dislike the way $BSS handles their licensing activation. It's rife with bugs. Not a week goes by where I don't have some crazy license issue with someone's $BSS installation.)

&gt;Me: Okay, I have one more thng we might try. Unfortunately, if it doesn't work, we'll have to uninstall and reinstall the entire suite.

&gt;$BCA: Okay! Let's try it! I'm okay with doing a full install, though!

We went into the credentials of her PC, removed everything associated with $BSS, and tried to fire up $BSS.

(Last side note: I also dislike how ""helpful"" PCs are when it comes to storing credentials. there are two places that, if you have credentials stored or connected to $BSS, it will break licensing... which is rife with bugs already.)

Predictably, it didn't work.

So... we uninstalled $BSS, rebooted the PC, and began the reinstall process.

During the installation, we chatted away amiably, mostly small talk. It's good to not talk about tech stuff at times.

We got everything installed, activated the software, made sure the licensing was squared away, and made sure everything worked properly.

&gt;$BCA: Oh, that's awesome! Thank you so much! Where can I give you your 5 stars!?

She thanked me for **my** patience. This is why I like Canadian admins.

Hey there TFTS!!! [u/8l4ck83rry](https://www.reddit.com/u/8l4ck83rry) back again, with another chapter from my IT saga! I’ll try to post one every week \(until I’m caught up to the present; it’ll be quite a few\). So, without further ado…

**The VERY old man**

**Setting** A client\-facing service desk, in the biggest municipal area for 120 miles in any direction. The city itself is constantly flooding, or choked in smog, or Imhotep\-level dust storms. Its boundaries are defined by the “loop”; a circular road on the edge of it. Everything out past the loop looks like a setting from a Mad Max movie. The general population is typically missing some sort of body part, and people usually have more fingers than teeth. Oil is the life\-blood of the land. And now, the players!!!

**$Me –** 8l4ck83rry

**$OldMan –** a very old man

It’s mid\-shift, and the work flow has been steady. Clients have been updated on the status of their repairs with us, the “worst technician ever” \(**$SnappleFacts;** more on him in a later story\) was out that day, and everything seemed to be humming along. Then, something foul came in on the wind…

An elderly gentleman came trudging towards the help desk. It was commendable, seeing as how each step almost seemed smaller than the last, and rocked his body back and forth almost like a child’s wind\-up\-robot toy, with the cane slung on his arm acting as both pendulum and metronome. We make eye contact, and I start to move towards him so that I can assist him with his device, when suddenly it hits me. I can only smell urine. This isn’t pee, the like of which would come out of a child, but the heavily medicated, stagnant, fermented pee of someone who is quickly approaching the top of the reaper’s list. In a display of professionalism, I stop myself from recoiling in disgust and from grimacing \(I think I strained something in the process\) and pull out a chair for him to sit on while I work on his device.

At this point \(all while breathing only through my mouth\), we being the check\-in process, and I start collecting all the usual information \(client name, whether or not there’s an active SLA, device issue, etc\).

**$Me** – Good afternoon Sir, what can we do for you?

**$OldMan** \- \*speaks unintelligible words\*

**$Me** – I’m sorry Sir, I couldn’t make that out. Could you say that again.

At this point, I have to lean in closer, and some part of me in the back of my head is CERTAIN that I’m going to be tasting this smell for the remainder of the day

**$OldMan** – I can’t get online.

**$Me** – Ok, mind if I take a look?

**$OldMan** – Ok…

I take his laptop from him, start it up, see that it doesn’t require a password, and start checking his network connection. All the while, **$OldMan** is staring off into space, either communing with being from another world, or forgetting where he is; it was hard to tell, the pee smell was suffocating and impaired my ability to think.

I noticed that he had a Chrome window open, but none of the tabs had loaded. I checked his wi\-fi connection, see that the physical switch is off, turn it back on, enter the SSID and password for our guest test wi\-fi…

**$Me** – Alright Sir, it looks like your wi\-fi was off, so I turned it back on for you. Since the fix was so simple, there’s no charge today \(\*usual charge for a “Quick Fix” was $40\). I’m going to go ahead reload these tabs so that you can see that everything is working.

I want to start this part by saying I wish we didn’t have to be so thorough. I also want to say that I wish they implemented a content filter on our test wi\-fi. I reload all 8 tabs in quick succession, moving from one tab to the other before the prior is finished loading.

I quickly close the tab, only to be greeted by another NSFW. On closing that, another NSFW. This continue through all the tabs.

I close out the entire window, and, while trying to maintain professionalism,

**$Me** – Ok Sir, you’re good to go.

**$OldMan** – Ok.

I close his laptop, and stand back, giving him room to stand up, and getting ready to catch him if he should fall over \(it looked like he might\). After about 30 – 40 seconds, he’s out of the chair, and without a word, he begins his wobble towards the store enterance.

Now I had been in that smell for a relatively short time. However, due to its pungency, I had gone nose\-deaf to it relatively quickly. So, I was a little surprised/concerned the smell reared its offending head again. I looked back at where he had been sitting and did my best not to wretch; turns out, he had peed. Again. In the seat. And it spread to the carpet. Much like glitter, this stuff got everywhere! I don’t even remember him touching his pants, and yet, SOMEHOW, it go onto the desk.

775,We didn't start the fire,"This happened many years back while working tech support for a very large software company. They had recently started beta testing a hosted service that included email. This company is big on dogfooding, or at least at that time they were. This meant that a number of employees, including the senior VP for hosted services, had been migrated to the new service. Technically employees still had access to their email on the older on-prem servers as a backup but most of them forgot about this.

One day our manager tells us that there has been an incident at the data center that was hosting the Exchange servers. Apparently workers were replacing batteries in some of the UPSs when a wrench was dropped causing one of said batteries to arc and set off the fire suppression system and shutting down the servers. As a result a bunch of employees call in wanting to know why they can’t access their email and most are understanding and just need a little help accessing their on-prem email. We didn’t get all the details until later, all we know at the time was that the fire suppression system was triggered and the fire department was called.

Then I get a call from the VP about why he couldn’t access his email on his pet project. 

&gt; $VP Why can’t access my email?

&gt; $ZM Well sir that’s because the data center is currently on fire.

&gt;$VP What do you mean the data center is on fire?

Part of the agreement with the install was **$ISP** would either send out one of their own install techs or hire a vendor to come run these two cables. Everything was all scheduled out and this is how it goes.

At this point I let him go off and make a call meanwhile I'm calling PM at **$ISP** to let them know whats going on and get it corrected. PM states **$FNG** was to pull and terminate cable as I expected. About this time **$FNG** shows back up to tell me boss told him to start and he would straighten it out and get back to us. 

About a hour later **$FNG** shows up to tell me he's all done. Before I could get a word out of my mouth out the door **$FNG** goes and down the hall I go to demarc.

778,I was not informed about the consequences of my actions,"Sometimes I wonder how can we expect more from the users when the IT managers are ... let's just say how they are.

So, I work as a trainer for a L1 support team, part of my job is also to assist our team's managers as well as the L2 (Local IT). A few months ago one of the IT managers from one of our locations decided he wanted to make a change that will help improve the process. Most of the time they need to inform us about their brilliant ideas and I was also put in CC in the email.

What he wanted?
To grant access to all his users to create a certain type of tickets that only the IT users can create. Even tho it was only one type of tickets the platform does not allow you to give permissions to only one type, it's all or nothing.  

I ask the manager if I should reply and explain the nice way why his idea was stupid and he said yes. 
So I start writing an email where I explain that this specific access cannot be provided on it's own and what he's basically asking for is to make all his users IT users. (I'm not even going to go into the reporting issues that I have explained to him) but I did explain that his users cannot create normal tickets that will reach the L1 team properly, this access will give them permissions to send the tickets directly to the Local IT and even Central IT. 

I strongly advised him not to go thru with it. 
Shortly after that I was removed from the cc in the upcoming emails and heard that he has included a higher up manager. I though the manager will explain maybe in a better way.

A few months have passed and I did not even though about it until all hell broke loose. I heard that the change was logged in the system and also approved by the regional manager. A few weeks later all those clueless poor souls of users had access to create IT users tickets, will you blame them for sending stupid password reset tickets to a central IT that does not even deal with that specific application. 

Now this is where the even more stupid part comes in. The IT manager contacts us because tickets reach central teams directly and he does not know what's happening. 
I explain to him once again that part of the access that he had requested also includes this specific access for them. I suggest one more time to revert to the normal process and this will be solved. 

You will expect him at this point to realize his mistake and let us fix it. Nop, he still wants his users to have that specific access so only after another 2 weeks and probably escalations from all teams, confused users that did not knew what was happening and other issues that I have already predicted in my email he ask us to change them back and only keep 10 of them with this access. 

TL;DR: IT manager wants to make all his business users IT users, ignores my email where I explain the consequences of this action and gets what he wants only to realize that it's a disaster and needs to go to the old process.  ",False,243,21,Lizregbel,talesfromtechsupport
779,The Help Desk is plotting (against me),"Background: I work for a local manufacturing plant which is part of a larger, international consortium. Right now, I work mostly as Desktop Support with some Network Administration and Infrastructure thrown in for good measure. We've recently \(last couple of years\) outsourced our Help Desk \(HD\) to a third party vendor in the Middle East.

Our customer is an engineer who has been with the company since mainframes were a hot commodity. I get the ticket from the HD stating that the user needed to add a plotter in his area. The ticket history showed that the HD asked for permission to remote into his machine, they received permission, remoted into his machine, and proceeded to NOT find the plotter in the list of available plotters. So, they kicked it over to us.

I emailed the customer to find out what happened when he navigated to the printer/plotter list \(ours is a standard file share setup for printers i.e. \\\\companyname\\printers\). He proceeds to navigate to \\\\companyname\\printers and finds the plotter without issue. After double\-clicking the icon and sending a test message, the customer is happy.

I check the ticket to find the HD agent who couldn't find the plotter and try to contact him. Instead, I get his supervisor who proceeds to tell me that this agent has been fired for basically being as unhelpful as humanly possible.

The supervisor looks at the ticket and asks if I was able to resolve the ticket. I tell them what happened and he says, ""If the plotter is plotting, why are you calling me?"" then hangs up the phone. 

Ordinarily, this wouldn't bother me since I have a thousand other things to do but this one just rubbed me wrong.

I contacted my supervisor who told me he'd look into it.

780,That's not my job! &amp; I got confused so I deleted them!,"Two stories for you all today. Both involving stupid users.

For those of you who don't know. I am an application admin in the health care sector. Since februari last year I've started working for a relatively small company (~700 employees) and as a result I have to wear a lot of different hats. Which is fun, and sometimes leads to these situations.  
We've outsourced our workplace automation and support for most of the basic stuff to a third party which comes with it's own helpdesk. This third party is relatively new to us, and as a result there's the occasional bits of friction. It used to be so that if you called IT someone would likely come over either the same day or the next to help fix your problem. Pretty much no matter what the problem was. From lost passwords, to unplugged devices and if it fell outside the guy's scope he'd get in contact with the right people for the user in order to sort things out.

Things have changed for the worse for most users as the new party won't do on-site support and generally handles everything through a much larger helpdesk. This frustrates some of our users who would take instructions like 'Move your mouse upwards' as literally as possible.

Over the last two days I've been having a conversation with a user via a kind of e-mail systen that's built in to our client information system. She had called me before that she had trouble with her e-mail account. Since that's outside my scope I told her to call the helpdesk instead.

&gt;User: I can't log in to work. When I go to the intranet site and try to log in with my &gt;mail adress and the password from PUSH.
&gt;But it's not right.  
&gt;I can't log in at home.....I don't know where I have to be and where I have to enter my username and the password from PUSH.
&gt;I can't get in to the team e-mail.  
&gt;I already have a google account.....?  
&gt;And what do I have to do with that....Where do I have to go...?

&gt;User: Yes that's correct.

&gt;User: If I go there I get my own gmail. It didn't ask me for a password.

Okay so now I'm apparently supporting privately owned devices... Too late to back out now.

&gt;Me: Okay, you can log in to multiple google accounts on a computer. Can you follow these instructions:  https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1721977

&gt;User: I managed to do it, in part. It keeps saying that the password is incorrect and I should contact the domain admin.  
&gt;I got this password from PUSH on the 14th of may: &lt;password&gt;  
&gt;I didn't get a password yesterday.

&gt;Me: Okay, well in that case PUSH will have to provide you with a new password. I'm not allowed to change those. (Really I'm a full google superadmin but I'm not allowed to make these changes much less interesting story which you can ask me about)

&gt;User: OK... Can you instruct PUSH...?

&gt;Me: I'm afraid not I've got a full day today and I won't have the time. Quickest way is if you call them.

&gt;User: I'm not going to call them again. It was hopeless yesterday. Not my job...

At this point I stopped replying. Because the only reply I can give at this point while keeping my sanity is that it's not my job either to call the helpdesk on her behalf.

I got a phone call from a user who needed login credentials for our HR self service portal.  
I recognized her name. Because I had provided account details for her maybe 2 or 3 days ago. And my coworkers (and PUSH) would have provided her other accounts in roughly the same timespan.

So naturally I asked her to check her own private e-mail to see if she'd already gotten her login credentials.

782,"The tale of the virtual Database server, the veteran Dev, and his son, the IT guy.","This, my fellow IT heroes, is why it NEVER pays to be cheap in IT. Also, why family/business ought to be separate.


As I've mentioned before, I am the IT manager at a medical facility, so I wear a lot of hats every day: SysAdmin (most of the time), basic computer skills teacher, Network Admin, VMWare admin etc...


My environment consists of several physical servers and a VMware virtual environment that we are migrating to. We also host multiple EHR systems on-site, seeing as this is a multi-specialty practice and neither the dental department's boss, nor our eye department's boss liked the main $crappyEHR used by the medical department's doctors. This happened before I was involved, and ownership decided to purchase seperate, specialized EHRs for those departments, which makes sense, because as specialized ones, they were better suited to the job then $crappyEHR. The databases for those specialized EHRs, $crappyEHR, and our practice management system that ties all of them together through interfaces were all then stuffed onto a single, physical database server. No redundancy, because at the time, Money. 1 point of failure. Sweet. Fucking. Jesus. 


After I got involved, one of my first missions was to rectify this situation, firstly because if anything happened to that Db server, the place was screwed, and secondly because the guy that built the server in the first place built it with a RAID that only had 250ish gbs of space, which by this point had MAYBE 10 gb of space left on it. The situation was pretty critical, and was compounded by the sloppily written queries being used by $crappyEHR, which to their credit they are currently working on optimizing.


Now to introduce the characters:

$me: your's truly

$dad: my father, a software developer with 30+ years of experience. He's an absolutely brilliant developer. I've literally yet to meet one that comes even close, and his SQL queries are ALWAYS optimized. He's known ownership for 20 of those years, and who they trust more than they do me with computers...despite me having proven, time and again that in matters that don't include development, I'm more competent. I took the job as a favor to him (and the fact that they gave me a competitive salary, plus I like the guys too, when they actually trust me.)

I was looking to at least begin solving this problem, and having it cost as little as possible. Based on what I was seeing with the Db server, I figured moving it to virtual would be a problem, and virtualization would be impossible without completely re-configuring the SAN we were using for the virtual environment. There would be severe i/o bottlenecks. Unfortunately, I turned into Cassandra when this was discussed with $dad and ownership, and my instructions were ""virtualize the server, add some HDD space. It should work fine."" Because, hey: we have a mostly empty host, and we have space on the SAN, and it'll be free. Meanwhile, 3 more SAS disks to build a RAID at least 3 times the size of what we have now will cost $1000 (physical server had 3 empty HDD bays).


So I did, against my better judgement. Spent a Sunday remotely converting the server to a VM, and sticking it my mostly empty 3rd host. Knowing the potential for issues to arise, I kept the old physical server intact, just disconnected. I think most of you can already guess what happened, but I'll tell you anyway: PAGEIOLATCH wait types, and the ""I/O taking more than 15 seconds error"" in the SQL server log. Most of these are caused by the slow-working queries of $crappyEHR, which now have to contend not only with how they are written but with i/o bottlenecks. 


Here's the problem though: I can't just roll everything back. Things have to be working. We can't experience downtime. It takes me time to convince $dad and ownership that nothing can be done about the queries right now and finally purchase those 3 HDDs. I plug them in, build a second RAID on the physical server, and restore the databases from backups I made on the virtual server, all this time being told by my $dad that this will not rectify the situation. It did. Not quite...since there are still latch waits, but $crappyEHR thinks that's their fault. But all the time that server was a virtual instance, the staff was experiencing periodic freezes, with waiting tasks on the Db server skyrocketing into the hundreds (that I noticed). That is no longer the case, and the other databases work without a hitch. The virtual server will serve a role as pseudo-redundancy in case this one goes up, until I can get something into the budget to rectify that problem.

 CU: well i'm not one of your customers. I use my neighbors' wifi.

 HD:...ok...but i cannot assist you if you're not one of our customers.

 CU: WHY NOT i've been using the internet just fine until yesterday!!! Undo whatever you did to block me from using the internet right now!!!

 HD: but madam there's nothing i can do, maybe your neighbor changed his password and you actually don't have the right to use his wifi anyways.

 CU: I can use the wifi if it's in my house YOU DONT OWN THE AIR!!! Connect me back to the internet right now or let me speak to your manager!!!

 HD: i'm sorry madam but as i said there's nothing i can do on my end and i cannot put you in relation with my manager.

788,"Measure thrice, pull once","Long time lurker...I think fourth or fifth time poster? Lost count. Anywho, here's a ""quick"" tale (that ended up longer than I thought it would, sorry ._.) that I find myself recalling to colleagues too often, and just realized I never shared it in here.

I was the sole Tier 2 IT guy in the state for an international company that had headquarters at least a timezone away, but had network management outsourced half a day away. I covered three sites, and served as the eyes, ears, and fingers of the various teams that oversaw the data centers and networks.  

During the early spring, I got an email from the datacenter team saying they have a fan error on one of their power supplies. I forgot what piece of equipment it was, but it was clearly being monitored from afar and worth my attention.  

One quick walk through a testing lab and two different levels of raised floor later, and I entered what I often referred to as my sanctuary. A well-cooled data center, filled with that white-noise that I'm sure many of y'all have grown to enjoy. It even had empty spaces in the racks where one could lay a piece of plywood across 4 racks and fit an IT guy needing a nap. This was a fact I never got to fully utilize, but it was often a nice daydream.  

It didn't take long for me to find the fan. It's one of two larger power supplies in some rather large network appliance that, again, I've forgotten the exact function of as I type this. One of the fans was running, and the one next to it had stopped...and had some gray and brown debris next to it. Upon closer inspection, I recoiled, but then began laughing my ass off while rummaging for my phone to snap a picture.  

A miller moth had somehow managed to get inside what is supposed to be a mostly sealed room with the exception of the door and air conditioning. As it flew around the room, no doubt trying to chase all the various blinkenlights around the room, it had managed to fly into this power supply fan. Suffice to say I was easily able to make a comparison to a bird hitting a jet engine, except the little bits of wings and a couple legs made the event seem more like a wood-chipper accident. In any case, this moth was apparently big enough to actually cause a failure inside the power supply and kill the fan motor.  

With my findings, photo, and a slew of Monty Python jokes prepped for the email (""It is an ex-moth, it has ceased to be, it has shuffled off this mortal coil...and right into some coils inside the PSU"" etc), I headed back to my desk and replied to the datacenter team's email. Shortly after sending the reply, my Lync popped up with a ""LOL"" IM from the datacenter guy who had emailed me. He had appreciated my detailed description, complete with Monthy Python reference. We then began discussing replacing this PSU, including a maintenance window. As most organizations go, the maintenance window had to be after hours. I CC'd my manager on the email so he could approve the overtime, and I spent the next week waiting for the part to come in.  
   
  

In a surprising twist, logistics managed to get the part to arrive half a week early. Despite this miracle, we still stuck with the planned window. The evening of the replacement, I took the time to walk around the office and just take in how eerie it was for no one to be there except for me. Various ideas in the ""big list of things to do in the office when no one else is around"" passed through my mind. Unfortunately (or fortunately), none of those ideas were capitalized on due to my being tired and just wanting to get started on my 45 minute commute home as soon as possible. I walked the part from my ""staging area"" (an empty spot on my desk) to the data center and started making ready to swap out the PSU.  

It's so nice living in an age of standardized parts and hot-swapping. The whole ordeal itself didn't even need any tools. Just unscrew the screws keeping the PSU in by hand, unplug it from the UPS connection beneath the floor, pull out the PSU, and reverse the process with the new one. Seems easy enough, right? No problem.  

First step was to get under the floor. It was a raised one so I had to dig out and dust off the hook we left hanging on one of the racks. I pulled up the tiles, and suddenly had to reassess my entire outlook on life at this organization...  

Beneath the pristine cable organization and crisp, cleanliness of this dataceter was a veritable hellscape of wires and plugs. It was as if all the repressed frustration of the team that put this place together was quite literally buried under the finished and polished product. It was like some kind of cable management graveyard after what was clearly a sysadmin version of The Purge. Yes, plugs were labelled, but half the labels were worn out from other wires sitting and rubbing on them.  

With hook and flashlight in hand, I started pulling up more tiles until I had pulled open a fissure from where the PSU cord went into the floor and where the UPS plugs were coming in. Seeing a larger portion of ""The Place where Cable Management Goes to Die"" didn't make it much easier. Much like the present-day gawkers looking at the fissures in Hawaii spewing lava, all I could do was take photos with my work phone to send back to the datacenter team. I knew full well that my manager wasn't going to let them dump an entire cable reorganization project on me. Besides, I always wanted to meet some of these datacenter guys. They seemed nice, and it kinda sucks being the only IT guy in the state.  

After taking another look at the mess, I finally got down to business and started tracing the PSU cable. Mind you, this wasn't your typical power cord. This thing had some *girth* to it. Unfortunately, so did everything else under that floor, including the cables from the UPS to their respective plugs. Between the lack of light and the tangled mess, I was having moments of cable racism, because all these cables looked *exactly the same*.  

I traced the cord, tied a piece of painter's tape around it where it plugged into one of the UPS connections, and then went back to the PSU to trace it again. I'm a human being. I've made mistakes. Making flaming mistakes is a familial trait on my mom's side (she managed to kill an entire magazine distributor's print queue in the early 90s with one malformed print command), and I was no exception. I traced this cable again, pulling on it to see what moved beyond the knot it was passing through. Once again, I made my way to the painter's tape.  

I was victorious! I had managed to wander through this valley in the shadow of cable spaghetti, and get the same result. Now it was time to pull this cord from the stone and be crowned King of the Britons.  

Anyone that's had to do anything in a datacenter related to power probably knows full well how tough this twist-lock plugs can be. Given how long these cables had been plugged in, and how much anger I could feel radiating from this pit of wires, extracting this plug was no small task. After twisting it for some time, I got it to turn to the pull-out position. With a solid ""guy using muscle for manly things"" grunt, I pulled the cord from the plug....  

...and then there was silence.  

No. This wasn't just me taking a breather. This was **silence**.  

The typical hum of fans in the datacenter had ceased. I hadn't been in an area this quiet since wandering around the empty offices. It was unnerving, and I could only hear one thing:  

&gt; ""Put it back..Put It Back...Put-It-Back-***PUT IT BACK!!***""

To this day, I cannot recall if that voice was in my head, or coming out of my mouth. All I knew was panic followed by a multitude of attempts to cram that plug back into the receptacle from whence it came.  

Thankfully, having been extracted already, this plug was able to be plugged back in with minimal effort. I even did another grunt when I twisted it back to the locked position.

A familiar hum started to return to the room. Lights began coming back on. What was dark turned red, then orange, and eventually green. Life returned to the Cisco IP Phone on the desk. I sat there, wiping a bit of cold sweat from my brow, as I did a very casual inventory of all the systems from a distance, looking for any lights that hadn't come back on automatically.  

It took a couple of minutes for me to recollect myself, and then pick myself up to go manually power on a couple of the older servers. As I went over to them, I saw that the big ""smart"" PDU we had in the back of the rack was complaining about a recent power loss. I got the older servers started up, and went back to the PDU. I then checked the cord coming from it and running towards the floor...and had a headslap moment.  

The PDU cord crossed over with the PSU cord behind the rack in a way that I had missed. While I was successful in tracing the cord from the floor to the UPS plug in Cable Management Hell, I had been tracing the wrong cord. Again, cord racism, they all looked exactly the same. I had unplugged the PDU that was powering most of the network core, and all of the servers that hadn't been retired and shut down. The accidental moment of silence resulted.

A few minutes later, I was able to successfully trace the cord from the PSU all the way down the rack and to where it plugged into the UPS plug underneath. Another piece of masking tape with an actual label went onto the plug, and then I went to tracing again from the plug back up to the PSU.  

I traced it back up the rack, back to the dead PSU with moth pieces. Following that, I traced it back down the rack, into the floor, through the electrical spaghetti monster, and back to the labelled plug. A twist and a pull later...and nothing happened.

This was a case of nothing happening being the best thing that could happen. I pulled the cord through the twists and turns, my mind treating it like a victory parade. Got it past the floor, and pulled the busted PSU out, cord and all! I put the new PSU in, ran the cord on top of the slithering snake pit, left a painter's tape label on the plug, and plugged it in. I wrote down the PDU label on the plug I had accidentally pulled so as to avoid that mistake in the future.  

With both power supplies running, I closed the fissure I'd pulled open into the floor, and then went over to the Cisco phone to call our after-hours network team on the other side of the world:

{wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey back to 2002-ish}
  
We had just purchased a nice new family PC. So new, it had the latest and greatest - 2.2~~M~~GHz^* Pentium4, 512MB RAM, 20 (or maybe 40) GB HDD - and... *drum-roll-please*... Windows-XP.
  
Remember, this is back in very early 2000s, and most households would only have one PC. We had several, but that was because I was (still am-ish) in 'the industry'. So, this new PC was the shared family PC. 
   
My youngest loved *Lego Island*. So I set up a non-admin account for him and I said ""go for it"". He was about 8 years old at the time, but he knew how to install software.
   
Problem the first - ""it won't install - can't access 'c:\program files'."" - I started the installer with Admin Privs. Problem solved.
  
Problem the second - ""it won't run"". Do some troubleshooting, come up blank.
  
Problem the third - off to 'lego software support board' and after several messages ""back and forth"" - their first 'resolution' was ""it doesn't run on Windows/XP"".
  
Well, actually, it does. When I logged in as Admin, it would work ""just fine"". So yes, it *will* work on Windows/XP.
  
""Oh, you need to run it from an Administrator account"".
  
Nope, not gonna happen. This is a shared PC, this is an 8 year old wanting to run his game, and there are others doing University and College and (eldest son) High School work. Giving Admin privs to an 8 year old is not going to work.
  
their 'tl;dr' was ""tough!""
  
Not being one to take this lying down, I started analysing what was going on when the program was running, and found out that there were some files being modified under the program's ""program files\lego software"" directory tree.
  
So, created a ""lego software"" group, added son's account to same, granted that group ""full access"" down the tree, and got him to log in and have another go.
  
Worked like a bought-one.
  
Went back to 'lego un-support' and documented what I had done, and suggested that they may want to think about something similar in their installer when using Win/XP.
  
Funny, I received no response to fixing their software installation for them :/

795,The time we discovered how many mechanics it takes to fix a printer,"Hello TFTS, Bowling Alley Guy is back, and I probably should have included a trigger warning in the post title given this sub's relationship with printers. Oh well, too late now, I guess we'll just roll with it. I hope this story is appropriate, given that we were playing both the tech support and (l)users roles for this one.

* * * 

The scene was *not* another ordinary day at $Rundownlocation, in fact we were just finishing up a massive project that saw us replacing nearly a quarter million dollars worth of equipment (that I can't be too specific about). During the course of the project, yours truly worked 11 hour shifts daily for nearly two weeks assisting the install crew in any way I could and staying after they left to troubleshoot the inevitable issues they would leave behind. It was exhausting, and everyone was dragging heavily by the end.

This particular day was the final day the crew was in town, and they were helping us out with any and every issue they could find on our pinsetting machines in an effort to help out as much as possible with the time they were allowed. I spent most of my time helping them replace parts and lubricate nearly every contact point in all 40 machines. My ""C"" mechanic meanwhile was working on facility stuff that had been postponed during the project. By the end of our shift, we were tired, dirty, sore, and ready for our first day off work in nearly a fortnight.

Since I was familiar with the new equipment, I decided to use the last of our time to train $C on some of the useful new features it had. This involved printing some reports from the new front desk computers and taking them to the back where I had set up a spreadsheet to log all the information on the shop computer. Then that would be printed out and filed. Pretty simple stuff. So simple a mechanic can do it.

Or so we thought. The first time we tried to print we got an error and a bunch of weird unholy sounds from the printer. It seemed like the paper would advance a couple inches and stop, followed by the printer having a fit. Rearranging the paper in the tray did nothing to solve the issue. Now, we're just mechanics mostly. We don't really have any experience working with office equipment, and especially not printers. But I've been reading TFTS for quite awhile, and I know the reputation they have here, so I was fully prepared to offer a blood sacrifice if that's what it took to print my spreadsheet.

After many more minutes of discussion than was probably necessary, the two of us mechanics came to the conclusion that we had a paper jam of some sort to deal with. This I thought I could handle. I've read stories about these. Just open the access panel and remove the offending paper. Well, because of reasons best described as ""cheap"", when I had asked my boss for a printer for the back, rather than get a simple office toner printer like every single other printer in the building, he had bought us a consumer grade photo printer. And they don't have access panels to clear paper jams. In fact, we were lucky to even have a panel to access the ink cartridges.

Many more minutes than I wish to admit to later, two highly knowledgeable mechanics came to the conclusion that not only did we not have a paper jam access panel, but we didn't seem to have any paper that was jammed anyway. *Something* was blocking the paper from getting through, but whatever it might be was so small and deep inside the printer we couldn't see it. At least until I got out my flashlight and caught a hint of ""neon blast yellow"" behind one of the paper guides.

You see, before the big project we had left a handful of bright yellow foam earplugs on top the printer, and used them as necessary throughout. But apparently, one had found its way deep inside our printer, a printer that was not designed to even be repairable. Normally, this is where users will break down and call tech support, but dammit, *we are tech support!* We can totally solve this ourselves, right?

I came up with a cunning plan. Using a flat blade screwdriver, I ~~jammed~~ gently wedged it under the plastic paper guide in an attempt to lift it out of the way. This turned out to be a very bad idea, since the guide was both held down with springs, and so thin that it risked being broken apart by the screwdriver. Clearly what this situation needed was more screwdrivers, so I asked $C to bring me all the flat bladed ones we had. He returned with a half dozen.

As carefully as a mechanic can, I slid them in one at a time alongside each other to support the paper guide without breaking it, and still left enough of a gap that I could reach in with a tool to retrieve the ear plug. During this process, our third mechanic arrived to begin the evening shift. $B was highly amused at the super high tech approach we were taking to printer repairs, especially given that he's about twice my age and could barely tell the difference between a printer and a cell phone.

So now with *3* mechanics surrounding the wounded printer, we were tasked with how to actually remove the stuck ear plug from a gap the width of a screwdriver blade. After careful consideration and much debate, we all concluded that it was easiest to simply push it back through into the paper tray with one of the screwdrivers.

Foreign body now removed, the printer happily printed out the spreadsheet like nothing was ever wrong. Or maybe it was because of the sneaky cut it left on the back of my hand that I didn't notice until I showered at home later. Blood sacrifice indeed.

796,Working with HR: The inevitable end of enthusiasm.,"So I was pretty new to the business, working hospital IT with focus on personnel and clinical software. That also made me the go-to guy whenever HR wanted some new process 'digitalized'. 'Digitalize' is the favorite word of our HR Director ($HRD). 

On a fateful evening, I was in a meeting with him and one of the HR clerks ($Clerk). The meeting had already been going on for about half an hour when $Clerk introduced the next point on her list.

&gt;**$Clerk:** So right now our employees can use self-service to file an application for vacation. We would like them to be able to do the same with special vacations.

&gt;**$me:** What kinds of vacation would that be?

&gt;**$HRD:** Marriage, childbirth, death of a close relative, death of a distant relative,...

The list went on. We went into specifics of what the user would be able to legally input (the country I work in has lots of regulation for that). In my head I planned for quotas, message boxes and even for an automated work list, that the clerks could use to keep track of whether documents like birth certificates had already arrived.

&gt;**$HRD:** Then there's [extra special kind of vacation]. We need a quota for that. In hours and not in days. Employees need to be able to apply for any number of hours at once. The quota needs to be as large as the amount of hours the employee works in a week and there are more factors when they're entitled to anything beyond one week.

At this point I'm having trouble to keep up with all the requirements, so I focus on the worst headache.

&gt;**$me:** The Self-Service platform we use only works with daily increments. 

&gt;**$HRD:** Are you saying it can't be done?

&gt;**$me:** I'm fairly certain that it's not intended for vacations in hourly increments, but I'll check what can be done. 

We continue to talk about the details, and the headaches just keep piling up.

&gt;**$me:** To be honest, this sounds really hard to implement. How important is it to get this vacation on the platform?

&gt;**$clerk:** An automated process would save a lot of time in cases where the employee applies under certain circumestances.

&gt;**$me:** How many of those cases do we have in a year?

&gt;**$Clerk:** We have about three or four applications like that.

At this point it might be important to note that the hospital has well over a thousand employees. Given that information, I made a naive suggestion.

&gt;**$me:** Maybe it would be better to start with the other vacations for now and focus on how best to implement [extra special kind of vacation] after the project.

&gt;**$HRD:** Why would we do that?

&gt;**$me:** To implement this vacation sounds like a lot of effort for restricted benefit. Projects often suffer from feature bloat-

&gt;**$HRD:** You don't need to tell me that! I know projects. If we don't digitalize this topic entirely, we might as well not do it at all!

&gt;**$me:** I'm sorry sir, but I don't see it that way.

&gt;**$HRD:** Keep your opinion to yourself then! You are a service provider. You are here to fulfill our requests.

The silence was palpable.

&gt;**$me:** ...understood.

Until the end of the meeting, the athmosphere felt like a disciplinary committee. I did my best not to offend any further, just asked for clarifications on some points and took my leave. For the months before this meeting, I had been quite enthusiastic about working together with the HR department. Now I understood that $HRD didn't quite see the IT department as valued colleagues. 

As I left the room together with $Clerk, we both exhaled audibly.

797,My branch is closing soon so I'll unhook everything! WCGW?,"This user calls me today and says that his branch was closing in a couple of days, so he ""unhooked everything."" However, he forgot that he needed to print off some shipping labels. I asked him to clarify if he just needs a computer hooked up or something else, to which he responds that no ""I disconnected all the wires in the room with all the wires and big boxes."" This translated in my mind as the server room. My translation was correct.

Thankfully, one computer was still connected to the internet, so I remoted into that computer and tried to see if we could have that computer as a place to start troubleshooting. The funny thing is that we could have stopped with the information we had now, but this is when he let me know that he absolutely needed to get some contacts from his Office365 account. The reason why we couldn't is because the port on the switch where the computer still connected was set to only have half of the intranet permissions of a standard PC on the network. So, we needed to get the cable into the right port.

We spent 5 minutes asking him if one of the boxes had 24 ports on it, to which he replied no. We asked again, and magically one of the boxes gained 12 ports. We checked his computer's port and told him that he needed to move the cable to another port. He did. In the wrong direction. We asked him to do it again, but this time to the opposite end of the switch. He did. Oddly, his intranet permissions stayed with him to that port. We asked him to move it to another port. It did. We couldn't ping the computer. We asked him to reboot the computer, still couldn't ping it. We asked him to ipconfig, his IPv4 address wasn't configured for our network.

We finally asked him to move it one more time, which caused him to still have the half permissions. However, we were almost an hour into the call and he said that the Office365 info wasn't super important, just the shipping label. So we made sure he could print the label. He could.

So, an hour after the phone call started, through frustration and hundreds of steps taken between the location of the computer and server room, we were finally able to print one measly shipping label. I hope he learned his lesson. Honestly, at the end of the day, I'm just glad  the wall jack was labeled correctly.",False,1928,124,DidYouKillMyFather,talesfromtechsupport

800,I deleted everything,"Got a nice one from yesterday. Not the best writer, but heres my best shot.

Background: I work for an MSP, typically out of a central office. We have clients all over the region, and some of our clients have weekly on site support in their contracts with us (one of us goes out and plays internal IT for a day type deal). 

My official job role is help desk (answering the phone when it rings, answering chats when they come in, etc), so I don't get to go on site a whole lot, but its nice when I get to. Yesterday, while I was relieving the normal on site tech, I got a ticket to rebuild a user's profile. Original issue is that apps installed through the Microsoft Store weren't opening, and the fix was to rebuild the local account. 

So I go through the motions of backing up his user data, removing the account from the machine, and get him back in. Apps installed through the store were working again, all was well. 

Until about an hour later, when the user comes over to me looking like he was on the verge of throwing up.

""Do you have my data still?"" he asks in an anxious tone.

""Of course. Backup disk is huge, no reason to immediately remove anyone's data. Whats up?"" I reply inquisitively. 

""I deleted everything,"" he said back to my bewilderment. What he actually meant is he was trying to set up a new git repo and in the process had somehow moved all of his local repos to his Recycle bin, then emptied it &lt;insert ""y tho"" meme here&gt;.

His repos were still his Documents that I had backed up during the original issue, so all he had to do was copy over the data from my drive, re-register the repo, and he was off and running. Not everyday I get to save someone's ass (or at least save them a ton of work), so that was nice.

**$Me:** So, **$User**, do you by chance have a coworker close by with a work phone that you could ask a question?

&gt;He does, I have him ask if they're able to connect to WiFi on their work phone, **$User** says everything is working on his coworkers end of things.

So I have him go to reset his network settings. When you do this, the device will ask for your passcode.

**$User:** What the hell is a passcode? 

**$Me:** It's what you use to get into your phone, when you unlock it you should usually enter a passcode.

**$User:** I don't know what you're talking about, but I've had this phone for 5 years and I have never had a passcode. 

&gt;His device was an iPhone 6. I checked the purchase date in our internal database, he's had the phone for a little less than 3 years. I didn't say anything of course, before I could say a word about what his passcode might be, he wants to troubleshoot on his own

Critical ticket comes into our team queue this morning for an issue with a timesheet report.

We get lots of these so the process is pretty much to call the user, get the report specifics, and tell them that I'm forwarding the ticket to the appropriate group.

TL;DR: Commands aren't usernames.

This story starts out with a well worded, well documented, and well intended e\-mail.

&gt;From:  Evric

&gt;Hello Nero,  
&gt;  
&gt;I am attempting to access the superuser \(su\) on ‘monitor’,  I keep getting “Access denied”.

I checked to make sure he should have access to the server, and I added his user to the server years ago.  So I send back the most useful response I can. 

&gt;That’s now how that works.  You need to login first, you then use SU to elevate yourself to root privileges.

807,"The worst epidemic of component failures ever, caused by a presidential memo. Only the floppies were safe!","This is probably the last of my stories about University Boss.  And it was his most epic ""save the day"" accomplishment while I was there.

**Me**: PFY (jr. systems administrator and support guy) in the Computer Science (CS) Department of a large university.

**Boss**: Sr. CS sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.

**Sandy**: Finance admin.  I don't even remember her name so I'm calling her Sandy.  One of boss's ""friends in low places"" that he liked to brag about.

**Setting**: Late 90s, the midst of the tech boom.

CS enrollment had been skyrocketing, but the department struggled to keep up financially.  Finally one spring, our budget was looking better and Boss and I were planning out some desperately-needed upgrades to servers, desktops, and labs.  As we were about to place orders, the President of the University issued a memo that ran something like this:

&gt; The University is having a cash flow problem.  An analysis has shown dramatic growth in spending for new computers.  Therefore, effective immediately, there is a University-wide freeze on all purchases of computers.  There will be no exceptions.

Of COURSE there was a dramatic growth in PC purchases.  This was the late 90s, when they went from things some people used to things everybody needed.

And it it was bad.  REALLY bad.  As if the Windows 3.1 lab wasn't embarrassing enough, we expected the servers to be completely and utterly unable to handle the load for fall semester.  The chair of the department made a heroic effort to make the case to administration that we were the freaking *Computer* Science department, but made no progress.  So, as usual, it fell to Boss.

Boss called up Sandy in finance.  Boss always helped her out with things, and she helped us out too.

&gt; Boss: ....  so can we buy used computers?

&gt; Sandy: No.

&gt; Boss: Is the money still in our budget?

&gt; Sandy: Yes.

&gt; Boss: So we can still spend the money, just not on computers?

&gt; Sandy: Right.

&gt; Boss: Do they realize how idiotic this is?  It won't save any money, will it?

&gt; Sandy: Of course not.  If the President had asked me, I'd have told him it was stupid.  But nobody ever asks me.  I hear the Board loved his initiative.

&gt; Boss: ...

&gt; Boss: Are we allowed to build a new computer from parts?

&gt; Sandy: No.  That's playing with fire.

&gt; Boss: Are we still allowed to replace parts in existing computers if they have problems?

&gt; Sandy: Yes.

Boss got off the phone with Sandy with a grin.

&gt; Boss: I need you to write a program to test the disks on the main servers.  Take the statistics you have for how much space each account uses, plus our projected enrollment rates for fall.  Write test data that uses that amount of space.

&gt; Me: Uhm, why am I doing this?

&gt; Boss: To solve all our problems, of course.

I was in the dark, but I knew enough to trust Boss by this point.

&gt; Me: Uh, OK.  But I think we won't have enough space.

&gt; Boss: That's fine.  Run it and let me know what happens.

So I wrote the program, ran it, and got the predictable ""out of space"" error.  Boss promptly fired off an order for some larger hard drives to replace the ones that were ""generating errors during testing.""  Ah ha, so THAT'S his plan!

Pretty soon we tested the memory against the projected load, and wouldn't you know it, we got more errors!  But the motherboard wouldn't support enough RAM, so we needed a new motherboard -- and therefore a new CPU -- also.  Maybe even a new power supply.

But never a new case.  And most definitely, never never never was I to touch the inventory sticker.  If I did, someone might think we had purchased a new computer!

So, many of these machines had entirely new guts, just saving their original cases and floppy drives (and sometimes power supplies).

We upgraded all of our most critical servers and two labs full of desktop PCs this way.  By the end of summer, we had almost all of what we wanted in the first place, which was good enough.  Nobody ever questioned it, and if they had, I'm quite sure Boss had filed away all these test reports to justify ""replacing the faulty components.""  He didn't violate the rule -- instead, he made sure to document how carefully he was following it.

And that is how a presidential memo led to the documented failure of hundreds of sticks of RAM, dozens of motherboards, and who knows how many hard drives, all within the period of a few months.

808,The Cockroach Incident,"LTL;FTP Hi everyone! Figured I’d start to chronicle my own experiences through IT, and what better places for all these whoppers than TFTS! Turns out, I’ve been \(un\)lucky enough to do/see some REALLY odd\-ball things \(and it hasn’t even been that long since I got into this game\). Fortunately, I when I started really developing in this field, I had some amazing people to show me the ropes. Now, without further ado, here are the players!

$8l4ck83rry – a “relative” newbie to IT; experienced carried over from military service, but not a whole lot of use when it comes to consumer electronics

$PokeTrainer – kindest, sweetest man anyone may ever meet; technically my “superior” based off of time with company

$Pineapple – Truly, a magic man

$DirtyClient – hopefully, self\-explanatory

$PHB \(Pointy Haired Boss\) – both a reference to the boss from Dilbert AND a direct comparison to what happens when someone who doesn’t know IT gets put in charge of an IT department

\*At this time in my career, I’m relatively new to IT. I joined up for a logistics/customer service/support role, and expected to do NO troubleshooting or IT duties, although that didn’t last long\*

The day itself started like any other day. I woke up about 30 minutes before my shift started, put on my Mormon\-looking, short\-sleeved, white shirt, my clip\-on tie, and my name tag, and headed on down the road to my place of work \(I’ll let you all guess what $ABC company I’m referencing here is\). At the time, I was attached to the IT repair/customer service department as the logistics employee, so it was my job to inspect all devices that needed to be sent to our service center for damage, ensure that it was properly noted, then package them so that they’d survive shipping, all the while keeping a paper trail. The city itself catered almost entirely to oil field personnel, and their living conditions were not always the most sanitary.

About an hour into my shift, $DirtyClient walks up:

$8l4ck83rry: Good afternoon! Welcome to $Company, how can I help you today?

$DirtyClient: Hi. My speakers don’t work, and I want to get them replaced.

$8l4ck83rry: Ok, I’d be happy to help with that. Do you have the speakers with you?

$DirtyClient: Yeah, here they are.

\*Looks over device, then pulls up $DirtyClient’s warranty info\*

$8l4ck83rry: Sorry, but it looks like this isn’t eligible for immediate replacement. We’ll have to send this out to be serviced instead.

$DirtyClient: But I bought the warranty.

$8l4ck83rry: Yes, but the terms of it state that you’re entitled to a repair, not a replacement.

$DirtyClient: I don’t want that. I want something done now!

$8l4ck83rry: I’m sorry for the inconvenience. I can check this in for you now, so that we can get started on it, if you’d like.

$DirtyClient: I’d like to speak with your supervisor.

$8l4ck83rry: Ok. Give me one minute, and I’ll get $PHB

I head back to the workshop and radio for $PHB to come over. When $PHB arrives, I explain the situation, and $PHB begins the show of “I’m sorry for your experience” and “We’ll have this done as soon as we can”.

After everything is entered, I hand over a claim check, and take the device to the staging area for inspection and processing. This is when things went a little sideways.

The day itself was rather busy, so the equipment sat in the shipping area for about an hour. Finally, I was able to get free, and proceeded to document the physical condition of all the equipment… and then it happened; a black dot seemingly moves out of, and then back into, one of the crevasses on the speaker I’m currently inspecting. At first, I think it’s my eyes playing tricks on me \(who hasn’t seen a tiny dot sudden appear then disappear\), but then it happens again, and again. At this point, I lean in for a closer look, and then recoil in disgust.

As is turns out, the entire tower speaker assembly was infested with tiny cockroaches. $DirtyClient somehow decided that Cheeto dust wouldn’t ever be a problem for electronics, because this device had it caked in every conceivable nook and cranny.

\*stares in disbelief\*

$8l4ck83rry: NOPE!!!

\*walks away and grabs $PokeTrainer\*

$8l4ck83rry: Will you take a look at this?

$PokeTrainer: What is it? It’s just a speaker tower. What’s up?

$8l4ck83rry: Just wait…

\*a few seconds go by, then 4 more cockroaches squirm out of the cracks\*

$PokeTrainer: Are those cockroaches?!?

$8l4ck83rry: Yeah, pretty sure

$PokeTrainer: OhMyGod!!! Dude!!! Give that thing back to the customer!!!

$8l4ck83rry: Can’t. They already left the store.

$PokeTrainer: Well, we can’t have it back here!!! They’ll spread to every other device!!! Who’s the customer?!?

$8l4ck83rry: It’s $DirtyClient. They spoke with $PHB and said they wanted a new one. $PHB said we would give them a new one if we couldn’t get it fixed. It’s covered in their warranty.

$PokeTrainer: But roaches aren’t!!! Go grab $PHB. We need to find out what to do about this! And try and contact $DirtyClient! This is sooo gross!

About 90 minutes pass while trying to grab $PHB. Apparently, $PHB felt like things that didn’t need to be counted, needed to be counted \(by hand\).

$PHB: Hey, what’s up?

$PokeTrainer: Hey, so $DirtyClient came by and dropped this home theater system off, and it’s filled with roaches…

$PHB: What…? That doesn’t sound right. What did $Pineapple say?

$8l4ck83rry: We didn’t check with him. We figured, since you are our boss, and the last one to speak with $DirtyClient, you should be the one to decide.

$PHB: Did you get in touch with $DirtyClient?

$8l4ck83rry: We tried, but no answer.

$PHB: Well then, I guess we gotta ship it off…

$PokeTrainer: I know. Let’s go ask $Pineapple. He knows policy pretty well. He’ll know what to do.

\*shouting to other end of workshop\*

$PokeTrainer: Hey $Pineapple!!! Can you take a look at this?

$Pineapple: Sure. What’s up?

$PokeTrainer: There’s cockroaches in this home theater system

$Pineapple: \*chuckles\* heh heh gross… Is the client still here?

$8l4ck83rry: No, they already left.

$Pineapple: Did you try calling them?

$8l4ck83rry: Yeah, no answer.

$Pineapple: Well, we are NOT sending that out.

$8l4ck83rry: But $PHB said…

$Pineapple: No. That is not covered by anything that we do. We can’t fix that. They have to come pick it up.

$PokeTrainer: But what do we do with it while we wait?

$Pineapple: I don’t know… wrap it up with shrink wrap…?

\*both 8l4ck83rry and PokeTrainer shrug and agree\*

Now, this is a full, 5 piece home theater set, and it’s the largest one we offered, so the smallest piece was the size of a beach ball. After 3 rolls of cellophane, rolling each piece of this set like a dung beetle rolls a ball of dung, we had everything sealed air tight. Then, $PHB shows back up.

$PHB: Hey, what’s that?

$PokeTrainer: The home theater system, that was infested with cockroaches…

$PHB: Oh! So it’s ready to ship?

$8l4ck83rry: No. We wrapped it up so that the cockroaches wouldn’t get out. We’re not sending to the service center, since they wouldn’t work on it.

$PHB: Who told you that…?

$Pineapple: I did. This thing is disgusting, and the service center would send it back, then charge us for wasting their time with something that is completely outside the scope of what they can work on

$PHB: Oh. I didn’t know.

$8l4ck83rry: So what do we do with it now? We can’t keep it here.

$PHB: I don’t know. Put it in the load bay until $DirtyClient comes to pick it up

So, PokeTrainer and I rolled these cockroach hamster\-balls into the loading bay, where they sat for a month before $DirtyClient came by to pick them back up.

809,“This includes spit!”,"Pre-text: I’m an electrical engineer who supports induction furnaces. Our furnaces melt anywhere from 1 ton to 100 tons of metal at a time down from scrap metal for foundries. Not your typical tech support. 

When I visit these foundries, I often have to review their safety material. Standard kinda stuff that they give out to contractors before permitting they do work. Often times the bigger companies do this to limit liability and the smaller don’t. 

I was at a medium sized plant in Wisconsin about to do some support on a holding furnace. Before I am allowed to do work I have to review their safety material and sign a few sheets. Kinda standard stuff at plants approaching this size.

As I am flipping through the book I get to the safety section regarding their melters and something peaks my interest. Normally, they’re pretty repetitive, but this page had one rule that I’ve never seen anywhere else: “No water on the operating deck. All water must be in the operators room. This includes spit.”

What? Spit. Why did it have to specify spit? So I ask the maintenance supervisor. 

“Oh well this is something you’ve gotta hear. We had an operator who liked to chew tobacco. Not really an issue as he kept his spit bottle in the operator room. Disgusting, but whatever. He showed up and did his job.

Until one day, he decided to put the spit bottle in the pocket of his shirt as he did his job. At first it wasn’t an issue, until toward the end of the shift when it got more and more full. 

You see he opened the furnace to check temperature visually. As he bent over it spilled out into the furnace. BOOM. Metal flew everywhere. He died in seconds. His body was 90% covered in iron. 

The kicker was his family sued afterwards. They argued that the no water rule was vague and he didn’t know it applied to spit.”

Face meet desk. 

“They got 2 million and the lawyers had us add the phrase to our safety manuals.”

Edit: Since there’s multiple questions. Iron is typically 2200 plus degrees F. Water pours into furnace and vaporizes near instantly after getting in contact with the metal. This causes the water to expand and steam. Metal goes along for a ride. Example: https://youtu.be/78CBUcGtfOs",False,1999,220,TraitorousTraveler,talesfromtechsupport

I recently encountered a weird issue that even our QA guru had never seen.


Laptop came in, note said ""glitchy video playback when top is closed"".


Now at first glance this might appear stupid. But this customer routinely uses laptops as though they were desktops. Why? I have no idea. They're usually set up on a docking station with an external monitor plugged in as well as keyboard and mouse.


Get the unit, boot into the inboard diagnostics mode and nothing seems wrong. So I send it back to QA with ""unable to replicate reported issue, no parts used"".


Now this unit isn't for the average user. It's for a more self-important class of user, so it gets extra scrutiny from QA. They boot the thing up using a test drive (with this class of user, the user drives aren't sent in with the unit. Sometimes even if the drive is the reported issue) and confirm that when you have video playing to an external monitor and close the top, the unit freaks completely. 


Video playback gets an extreme drop in framerate, audio gets distorted to hell.


They try everything from replacing the pcb separate from the motherboard that handles external video, all the way to the CPU.


Long story short, it was the pcb that houses the wifi switch and lid sensor that was malfunctioning. 


Never seen anything like it. I've seen them malfunction and result in the unit not seeing any wifi networks.


Although it will always bother me more that they use these laptops as makeshift desktops. Mainly because of the breakage rate resulting in them not really being cheaper.

@me \- well me the Security Guard

@tech1 \- Tech guy for the shift

@tech2 \- cause of the issue

So I work at a facility that deals with money, and we have ""guests"" at all times \(24Hx7D\). Whenever we have a machine that goes down @me or another security personnel must be present while the machine is open. Also this machine in question when you open it, it opens towards the ceiling with the screen pointed up.

@me and @tech1 went to class together for Cisco Networking.

I am standing by the door greeting and making sure all the guests who enter are of age when I get the call to meet @tech1 at a machine. Upon my arrival he tells @me that the touch screen is not working. So I do my duty I watched him work. So first thing @tech1 does is the typical troubleshoot, Unplugs and plugs it back in. And Walla the touch screen was working. So he thought, he closes the machine and goes to log out of the admin panel. No response. So we go on this hour long troubleshooting to no avail. @tech1 was able to deduce that when it was open it worked but when closed it stopped working. So he believed it was ether the power cable or the USB cable. While @tech1 was attempting to trace the wires I noticed that the USB hub had letters on each cable. I wait a few minutes just watching him trace the cable and loose where he was a few times and I casually mention ""you would think with this many cables they would have them labeled."" Needless to say after I mentioned that he found that there were indeed labeled and concurred that the USB cables were not the issue upon testing. @tech1 was at his wits end of the issue so I asked him when the problem started. He told me today after @tech2 installed the new screen. So we both came to the conclusion that the screen itself may be the problem. But problem is no other screens available to test this theory so he starts to close the system. As he is closing I notice the screen move. I mention this to @tech1 and he opens it back up and inspects and realizes a screw was missing at the bottom left. He tells me it is no big deal should not be and issue. So I reply, well if the touch screen works while system is open, and stops working while it is closed, and to shutdown/restart the system the door must be open. There is not any pressure on the bottom left of the touch screen upon restart and when you close it, it will apply pressure to the screen so since it did not have that pressure to begin with it is going to tell the computer someone is pushing on that area which will in fact make the touchscreen seem non responsive when it is closed."" @tech1 replies ""I didn't think about that, let me install a new screw real quick"" After he installs the screw, the screen becomes completely unresponsive and he the says, ""well that's probably why @tech2 did not install the screw, because it is not responsive at all now."" @me with my genius thought told @tech1 to restart the system with the screw installed. After bootup screen worked perfect. He closed the machine, exited admin menu with no issue, then turned to me and said ""I can't believe one screw would cause this much of an Issue.""

822,CEO support.,"No fanfare for this one. No embellishments. Just simple fact for this one as it was a huge facepalm when this happened. 

I am up in *another city* this week for a summit at headquarters. This was a situation where a tier 1 support walked into a room and did something that people who knew 7 million programming languages, centuries of experience, and hundreds of degrees and certs could not fix. (Ok I may embellish a little bit.)

We were in all area manager meeting with over 100 people at the meeting. The Cs, Ps, and EVPs, were all up on stage and the CEO was giving the presentation. Now keep in mind this is not a giant auditorium, more of a large conference room. 

The CEO starts clicking and clicking and clicking some more. He sighs and says his laptop is lagging again. Without missing a beat the area manager for the engineers stands up and goes to his PC. He starts running some network tests, other people are testing the physical location, and others still are trying to offer suggestions like a bunch of imperial commanders trying to impress Darth Vader. 

The comical scene unfolded for a bunch of senior programmers, system admins, exchange admins, and basically anyone who is ""smarter"" than the help desk all started scratching their heads. 

I silently walked up to the podium, grabbed a double A energizer out of the pack on the table, and replaced the battery in his wireless mouse. I flipped the switch off and on again telling him to try it now. The look on his face can only be one of doubt to genuine surprise as the lag went immediately away as soon as he tried clicking again. I heard a sigh from behind me and looked to see the face of the sysadmin. His, and everyone else's expression simply said ""Im dumb"" as they shook their heads and sat back down. 

The CEO shook my hand and asked for my name. He thanked me and went back to his presentation.

823,Customer blames me for destroying their networks IPS database,"So I work for a fairly large company which offers corporate network security products. We offer a product, and we support that product in case it breaks, but we do not contract administration of that product.

Basically, you buy the product and we assume that you are competent enough to hire someone who understands basic networking and knows enough about your network to do simple administration of an intrusion prevention system.

Months ago, a customer called in with several issues, all of which I either resolved \(in scope\) or provided them with adequate, official documentation to explain in simple steps how to resolve \(out of scope, local admins task\).

A few weeks ago, a sev 2 ticket comes in. My manager messages me. I'm already in a remote session with a client so I can't really respond to it, but I see the client name and ""sev 2"" pop up in the title and something tells me this isn't going to be good.

So I open the email, and check the ticket. The description was basically this:

""You told us to run some commands in mysql and we did and now our database is 0kb""

Obviously I entered a state of quiet panic. I can't say or do anything because I'm on a remote with a client, but in every spare second, every single moment where I don't have to actively do something in the remote, I'm sifting through the old cases, emails and conversations I had with this client, trying to figure out what I fucked up.

After 10 minutes of panic, one of the senior engineers picks up the case, as I am still occupied. I sit, try to focus, and continue to panic internally.

Another 15 minutes pass, my call ends. I sit in anticipation of the shame that comes with fucking something up and realising you are not fit for the role you were hired to perform. I look over at the senior engineers desk, and start listening to his conversation with one of the other senior engineers. I'll call the guy who took the case SE1 and the guy who he was talking to SE2. It went like this:

SE1: Dude.. Check this out. In their MySQL directory, they have like five mysql.exe files. One of them is spelled ""myqls.exe and one is spelled myslq.exe"".

SE2: Wait what? Why? What happened?

SE1: Well, they're saying their database is 0Kb, but I think they've renamed their MySQL executable. Check this out, there's a file named mysql.exeOLD which is about the same size as their DB executable should be.

SE2: Wait, mysql OLD?

SE1: Yeah, hold on, let me ask them what commands they're talking about which ruined their database

At this point I'm basically looking over the shoulder of SE1. I watch. Carefully. He asks them to repeat the commands I provided, in the most simply and straight forward way I knew.

They logged in to MySQL. That was it. That was the command they said had destroyed their database. It's also worth noting, that they logged in to MySQL incorrectly.

What had happened was, our product has a database. A small part of client\-side administration of the product can include running very simple MySQL commands on that database. They had such terrible knowledge of it that instead of actually following the steps that I had produced, they seemingly troubleshot a MySQL database in the same way that a level one service desk agent would troubleshoot an Outlook issue.

To quote the senior engineer:

""It seems like they read what you typed, and started troubleshooting based off what their own rough idea was of what you were talking about, without actually following the steps you provided"".

So, he renamed the \*actual\* mysql.exe file, deleted the new one the client had created, and the issue resolved itself.

Would she be happy with a faster desktop? No, because she already has a tablet.

What if I replace the desktop with a laptop? No, because then she will have to carry it around.

She says she has an iPhone, but she is too old to use something with such a small screen.

Can we tether her tablet to the iPhone? No, because it is a 5 and it probably can't do that or her carrier won't let her and no, I can't look and how can we run out of isp numbers?

Can we replace your desktop with a tablet? No, she already has a tablet and how does this place even stay running. Besides, she won't use ebay so can't I just monitor her every move? And there are always more numbers so how can the isp run out of them?

825,I just want to access my email.,"Just a little background, this was when I had a job that was essentially help desk for old people. It consisted of taking calls from people around the nation to help with whatever computer issues they had, but it focused on the 65+ Demographic. I was also a contractor paid by the ticket so they'd generally send me the ""More difficult"" tickets.

$CX: Customer.

$ME: The one and only.

I had been sitting back drinking my coffee when my phone rang. Ok, new call. I find out the customer is having a hard time accessing his email. Ok, no big deal I can help with that.

&gt;$ME: ""Ok, what happens when you try logging into your email?""

&gt;$CX: ""It says not connected to the internet""

&gt;$ME: ""Ok, good to know. Have you tried rebooting your router at all?""

&gt;$CX: ""I don't have a router.""

&gt;$ME: ""You should if you're able to get onto the internet as all. You might also know it as your modem. It's normally a small box with lots of blinky lights on.""

&gt;$CX: ""I don't think I have one.""

&gt;$ME: ""You should, it's normally installed by your cable company."" At this point I had seen in the notes that his contact email was Comcast. ""It's probably Comcast.""

&gt;$CX: ""Oh, I got rid of my Comcast the other day and got gmail instead.""

I checked his previous ticket and another tech had helped him set up a Gmail account.

&gt;$ME: ""It looks like the other tech helped you set up a Gmail account, but that's just for email. You should still have Comcast for your internet.""

&gt;$CX: ""I got rid of them because I have Gmail now.""

&gt;$ME: ""So, like, you cancelled your internet service with them?""

&gt;$CX: ""Yes, because I have Gmail. The other guy said I could use that and it was free. Why would I pay for Comcast?""

&gt;$ME: ""Uh, so you can use their email for free, but you still need internet to connect to it.""

&gt;$CX: ""But I just want my email!:

&gt;$ME: ""I understand but you're going to need Comcast to connect to your gmail.""

&gt;$CX: ""So you're saying that your tech lied?""

&gt;$ME: ""No, I think you misunderstood. You pay Comcast for internet and they also provide you with an email as a bonus. Gmail is free, but it's only for your email not your gmail.""

&gt;$CX: ""So how are you going to fix this?""

&gt;$ME: ""Sorry sir, you're just going to have to call Comcast and then get them to set up your internet again.""

Procurement lady was slightly stressed, which upsets my balance on a Friday so I said bring it over.  

A quick try, and a google told me enough - it wasn't going to work.. so looking round for alternatives - I remember getting touch screen pens and the like as freebies from vendors - perhaps that would work? After a full search lasting 2 minutes, I gave up, and suggested the user could use, maybe their finger? Failing that try a banana.

827,"When Email Doesn't Work, or, Fairly Local...host","The application team is reporting that emails aren't being sent from their test instance. There's 2 nodes in the cluster, and I check the postfix logs on both of them. No, emails are indeed going out. The logs report that the message was passed to the division mail relay, and the logs on THAT host show that the message was passed to the corporate server.  
  
""Oh, no,"" they say, ""We didn't get email that was sent at these specific *times*!""  
  
So I check the logs...and NOTHING. No rejection errors, no message received entries. NOTHING. Their application didn't SEND email, so of course nothing was received.  
  
They check the application logs, and there's an error. Permission denied. Well, that would have been nice to know. The mail client is configured to connect to mailhost.*COMPANY*.com. This hostname resolves in DNS to 127.0.0.1. All mail applications connect to the local sendmail daemon.  
  
So, this is obviously an application problem, right? Except node 2 doesn't match node 1. /etc/hosts doesn't have localhost listed for 127.0.0.1 on node 2.  I edit the file to fix this, asking myself what IDIOT deleted it...and discover that it wasn't deleted...it was MOVED to the primary interface IP address entry.  
  
That's right, folks! localhost resolves to the IP address of the host. Because the previous admins had a crack habit. Postfix is configured to bind to ""localhost"", but the mail app is trying to connect to 127.0.0.1. Which it can't because postfix is not listening on that address.  I fix the entry and restart postfix, and now the application works.  
  
  
This is endemic of a larger problem: the previous admins just did shit for *reasons*. Mostly because they were lazy and didn't want to do work. But this? Who the hell changes the localhost entry?

828,Sometimes one person shouldn't hold all the equipment purchasing power.,"Names are all fake.

So this was several years ago. I worked at a small company I hated for political and ethical reasons but stayed at for contractual reasons.

I was hired as a developer for a six month contract. They didn't have room near the other devs for a desk, so they stuck me in a storage room by myself with the biggest desk I'd ever seen. Apparently our new ex-banker CEO ditched the big desk to look less rich (this was not long after the recession started). Also in this storage room were boxes and boxes of... Routers? Switches? Servers? Speakers? What did a small middleman company need with half a data center of equipment?

I learned that this stuff was for our planned ""disaster recovery infrastructure,"" but the specifics of that plan were never made clear. It was always ""$Jake's working on DR so he'll get that stuff out of your hair soon!"" I didn't care about any of these people or this company so I didn't press it.

One day, near the end of my contract, $Jake quits unexpectedly with no two weeks. Management was like, ""Shit, what do we do with all this DR junk?"" Apparently they'd never actually looked at the stuff or the receipts. None of it made any sense; he'd blown $30,000 on unopened, out-of-date equipment that couldn't possibly be cobbled into something useful.

They decide to abandon the project entirely and try to return all the equipment. They found the seller's website while looking for contact information, and...

There's $Jake.

830,Never squander a good outage (and how to train a PFY),"After some years as a PFY and sysadmin, I got older, the gods ~~got revenge~~ smiled on me, and I became the boss.

I had a number of PFYs (Pimply-Faced Youth, young/inexperienced in IT) over time.  They were all good sorts, but naturally inexperienced.

What are the ""rules to live by"" I had to ~~beat into the heads of~~ explain to almost every PFY?

1) Check the simple things before you move on to the hard stuff.  **ALL** of the simple things.

2) Question all assumptions.

3) Don't give up easily.

4) When all else fails, see #1.

(People at the beginning of your career: take note!)

When a PFY got stuck and came to me for help, I would always ask about the simple stuff before giving other advice.  (You've got to LIVE the rules to internalize them.)

At the beginning, this would result in many trips back to the equipment, to personally verify that it was plugged in, that the power cable was seated properly (on both ends!), that the network cable was plugged in, etc.  This was always accompanied by a quantity of annoyed muttering.

As they got better, they would come to me saying, ""The box won't turn on, and I've checked both ends of the power cable, verified the outlet works, etc...""  You'd know they were about to no longer be a PFY when, in the course of explaining everything they'd checked, they'd realize what the problem was.

So one day, this happens, with the PFY about mid-way through this experience.

&gt; PFY: It seems like the network's down in all of finance.

This wasn't the sort of problem I could let go on for very long, so:

&gt; Me: OK.  You go up there and see what you can find out.  I'll see what I can find out from down here, and meet you up there in 5.

PFY goes up.  All I could tell from my desk was the line from the core switch to the finance area had no link.  I went up and met him in the finance network closet.

&gt; Me: What's the story?

&gt; PFY: I hope we have a spare switch.  This one's dead.

&gt; Me: Oh?  What have you tried?

&gt; Proud PFY: I know it's dead, because it won't power up.  The power cable in the back is in tight, and it's plugged in.  Unplugging and plugging it in doesn't help.

&gt; Me: Is it getting power?

&gt; PFY: Of course.  It's plugged into a UPS.

&gt; Me: Have you checked the UPS?  [ a small UPS sat there, front towards the wall, plugs towards us ]

&gt; PFY: It's fine.

&gt; Me: Is it supplying power?

&gt; PFY: Of course.

&gt; Me: Have you VERIFIED that?

&gt; Annoyed PFY: No.

&gt; Me: How about you do that then?

&gt; Grumpy PFY: Fine.  &lt;rustle&gt; &lt;rustle&gt; &lt;click&gt; &lt;beep&gt; &lt;whiirrrrr&gt;  Oh hey, the UPS was turned off.

So this closet was a general closet, full of filing cabinets and such.  The network gear was on top of one of the filing cabinets near the door.  I came to find out one of the clerks had been working in there, wanted more room, so she unplugged the UPS.  It started beeping, so she just pressed buttons until it shut up.  She then put it in the corner and plugged it back in, nice and tidy-like.

Interestingly, the CFO's office was also on this network segment, meaning I would be ~~burdened~~ honored by a conversation with him.

&gt; CFO: So this was caused by someone turning off the UPS?

&gt; Me: Yes.

&gt; CFO: Why haven't you locked up that equipment?  We should do that right away!

&gt; Me: Good idea!  I'll have a quote on your desk first thing tomorrow.

Handily, I already had that quote.  Because a few months prior, I had gotten a quote for proper network cabinets.  I had submitted it to the very same CFO.  And it had been rejected by the very same CFO (""that's a lot of money to protect against something that will never happen."")  So I printed it a second time and put it on his desk in the morning.  It was signed without question this time.

I had a post-mortem with the PFY, after telling him about the CFO.

&gt; Me: So what have you learned?

&gt; Dejected PFY: Always question my assumptions.

&gt; Me: Good.  What else?

&gt; Embarrassed PFY: Check the simple things.

&gt; Me: Excellent.  Anything else?

&gt; Confused PFY: No?

&gt; Me: Never squander a good outage.

&gt; PFY: Is that one of your rules to live by?

&gt; Me: It is now.

831,More from Aviation Maintenance: Exciting Training,"Reminded by [this post,](https://redd.it/8jux7a) here’s a story from when I was first getting trained on aircraft engines…

***

Because of the vast differences in background and experience new Soldiers can have, the very beginning of Aircraft Powerplant Training was focused on the basic physics behind jet turbines, their principles of operation, basic tool instruction and safety practices.  Among the various “don’t put your hand in there,” “cover all engine openings to prevent foreign object damage” and “protect your eyes” safety rules, there were several electrical practices that were emphasized to us.  Foremost among those was “prior to working on the exciter, use an INSULATED HANDLE screwdriver to push the electrical lead against the engine case to ground the system, once it is disconnected from the ignitor.”  

&gt;**$RandomTFTSReader** “Zee, what’s an exciter?  And why?”

Thanks for asking, $RandomTFTSReader, I’m happy to explain!

An exciter is essentially a box filled with capacitors used to power an ignitor (spark plug) during engine start and certain operation modes.  The amount of power that comes out exciter is rather large—the instructors emphasized just how dangerous the output was with descriptions of unfortunate mechanics being flung across hangars and off aircraft.  A typical exciter for an [Allison 250]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_Model_250) (used in the OH58D Kiowa, Star Vipers and numerous other aircraft) has a peak output current of 825A, peak voltage of 11.3kV and puts out around 10-12 sparks/second with 28VDC input.  

It’s a bad day in a box no larger than a paperback novel.

***

It was our second day on the schoolhouse floor actually working engines and [Joey](https://redd.it/71qg4j) and I were assigned to work with one another tearing down an Allison 250.  Because of the design of the engine, one of the very first tasks is removing the ignitor, ignitor lead, and the exciter.  Joey would take that task while I worked on removing the fuel system. I wasn’t paying too much attention to what Joey was doing, so I never saw him disconnect the exciter. One of our instructors did and as I reached out and touched the engine, he shouted at us.

&gt;**Instructor**  “Hey!  ZeeWulf!  Stop! Lie down on the floor, you just died!  Joey, you just killed Zee!”

Confused, I laid down as was instructed.  A second instructor came over and grimly pulled out some chalk with which he proceeded to trace my outline on the floor.  

&gt;**Instructor** “Okay, Zee, get up.  You’re done for the day, you now just have to stand back and haunt Joey as he works alone.”

&gt;**Joey** “What? That’s not fair, what’d I do wrong?”

&gt;**Instructor**  You never grounded out the exciter, and you didn’t warn ZeeWulf you’d disconnected the lead.  You got him killed.  I want you to think long and hard about that.”

***

The next day I returned to work, but the chalk outline remained—we were responsible for mopping up our area at the end of the day and they’d instructed us to let it stay as a reminder. It wasn’t the only mistake any of us made that week; later that week Shaver and Axe-Man returned from lunch to find every orifice of their engine stuffed with shredded newspaper—they’d forgotten to cap the holes for the ignitor, fuel nozzle and bleed air tubes.  To add insult to injury, the instructor explained that due to their lack of attention to detail, the engine was released and put on Joey’s helicopter and got him killed.  Shaver was instructed to write a letter of notification to ‘Mrs. Joey and family’ and explain how he got ‘her husband’ killed.  

Shaver opened it with “To Mrs. Joey and my children…”

**TL;DR:** Improper maintenance practices can lead to electric personalities.

832,"Just the VIPest person, the most VIP","My company was bought out by a larger company over a year ago and since then has been making a slow, steady conversion over to their systems. The most recent of which being an email migration where we're moving all of our company's emails to the new one's servers. Before it happened they sent out a company-wide email with instructions on how to install the new version of Office and activate it. Not a single goddamn person RTFE. Every single one of them has spent the last month calling in so we could read the instructions for them. People call in angry that they had to wait for an hour to get to us and it's made a job I actually kind of enjoyed stressful and draining, like a factory of misery.

But every now and then we get a legitimate issue with the migration, where someone followed the instructions but it still broke. I got one such call from a lady flagged as VIP in the system. I was almost kind of relieved to see that. So far VIPs had been polite, easy to work with, and had their shit together—the opposite of what I'd expected coming into this company. But VIP WITCH—VW for short—as we'll call her apparently skipped whatever common courtesy training everyone else got.

Immediately she demanded that I remote into her computer because she didn't have time to tell me what was wrong. So I get into her computer and open up to her Outlook and immediately see the issue: In the header of Outlook it shows her old pre-migration email address rather than her new one. The settings carried over from the previous install of Outlook which causes permission conflicts somehow. She confirmed this by demonstrating that her issue was that every time she tried to book a conference room, it gave her some sort of access denied kickback email—an issue I literally just easily described in one sentence.

&gt;**Me:** See at the top there? It shows your old email address, not your new one. That's what's causing the issue. We'll just have to rebuild your Outlook profile to fix it.

&gt;**VW:** I don't believe you. My Outlook has worked *fine* for an entire week like this, I don't think that's the solution.

&gt;**Me:** I understand that. Most of the time it does work for a little bit for most people, but eventually it starts having issues with calendar permissions like you're having now. That eventually degrades to the point where Outlook gets stuck in a disconnected status. I just want to fix this for you so you don't run into bigger problems later.

&gt;**VW:** Are you even listening to me? *It's. Been. Working. Fine. Until. Now.* That cannot be the solution, I have too many shared calendars and mailboxes and I don't want to lose them all and have to set them up again.

&gt;**Me:** No, I understand your hesitation. I'll definitely note them all and set them back up for you, it shouldn't take too lo—

&gt;**VW:** No. *No.* Profile rebuilds are just what IT does when they have *no idea what they're doing.* My friend told me profile rebuilds were just awful. Don't you have someone there who knows what they're actually doing that I can talk to?

I grit my teeth and tried and force it into a smile. She just called my competency into question. I can be patient as a goddamn saint while people scream at me—they're mostly just stressed because the issue is affecting their job performance. But personal attacks against my competency make me incredibly angry.

&gt;**Me:** I'm an experienced agent, I've been with this help desk for a year. I've done this dozens of times. It's solved the issue every time and there isn't any other documented solution right now. I apologize that it will take up some of your time to complete, b—

&gt;**VW:** Is there a manager I can speak with?

&gt;**Me:** I can definitely get you a manager. They'll follow the same process and steps I have to, howe—

&gt;**VW:** Manager. *Now.*

I politely and calmly informed her, despite my seething, indignant anger lurking beneath the surface, that I would be putting her on hold for a few minutes. I then walked over to my supervisor's(SUP) desk and informed him of what was going on. He asked me to message him the name of the person and ticket number, and have her leave a message on his voicemail because he was busy right then. I walked back and complied, messaging him the info and letting her know she could leave him a voicemail and he'd call back when he was available.

&gt;**VW:** You're telling me he's not available to talk to me *now*?

She said this in such a way that implied she was actually taken aback, like some peasant had dared turn down the queen for teatime.

&gt;**VW:** I need this solved now. You tell him once he solves that issue, I have two more issues that need looking at.

&gt;**Me:** While we're waiting for him, I could definitely look into those for you if you'd like?

She wasn't having it. We went back and forth for a few minutes, her insisting that she speak with him now while I tried to appease her and just get her off my phone. My supervisor messaged me back.

&gt;**SUP:** I knew it.

&gt;**SUP:** I knew it as soon as you said the thing about you not knowing what you're doing.

&gt;**SUP:** I just knew it would be her.

There was a pause, then as if with resignation, another message.

&gt;**SUP:** Tell her I'm available now.

&gt;**SUP:** I'll take the call

&gt;**Me:** Alright, sorry about this.

&gt;**SUP:** It's not your fault.

I transferred the call and had the decency to not press him for how it went after. I swear in the time that entire exchange took place the profile rebuild would have already been done and I would have been working on the next issue.

I turn on the TV screens, unplug both cables from user's laptop and connect it with the wireless system (which is usually more stable) to the TV screens. $CU then asks me what was wrong, but she probably didn't understand what I was saying, due to the fact that I had just started to talk when she started to talk to her coworker next to her, completely ignoring what I was saying.

They are basically webcams on bendy stalks that can be used to display what the camera is looking at onto the class projector (like homework). While the cameras work, they only work from one angle, forcing the teacher to have the visualiser between them and the work making it difficult to interact with the paper. These cameras are supposed to be able to flip the image so the visualiser can be placed on the other side of the paper.



The manufactures website has a mighty faqs that, naturally, does not mention this issue in the slightest. So time to dig. And dig. No help in the 1st few sites, then a bunch of adverts to buy the camera I already have. Finally I get somewhere. To flip the camera you nedd to go into $SettingA and check a box. But the box is greyed out so you also need to enable the flip option by going into $SettingB and changing the media format. Test and it works.

837,Users always know more than you what they need,"Hello TFTS,

This story happened a few weeks ago. To give a little bit of context before diving into this story, our company uses a third-party software for Internet security (whitelisting / blacklisting websites, with various profiles depending on user's occupation, so some users can access social networks with their profile, while others have a regular access and can't browse social networks, for example). Since last month, it's now up to our team to manage these profiles for our users, it was outsourced before that.

This security system is also blocking any FTP links, and this is where our story begins. It all started by a ticket (for once, they sent a ticket, not an email, that's amazing actually).

$Me =&gt; Myself // $User =&gt; The user // $UM =&gt; User's manager

&gt; $User: Hello Team, I need to have access to FTP links so I can download some apps for my work, but I'm being blocked by $Software. Please give me the profile $FTP_Profile

&gt; $Me: Hello $User, I've checked in our AD and there isn't any group for this profile, it appears that this profile doesn't exist. I'm going to check with the team who was managing that before to see what they can tell me about that.

So I've contacted the team who was managing profiles and accounts for this system before us, and they told me that there isn't any profile like that, apparently what users are referring to as ""another profile"" is just a process to whitelist FTP links. So I let $User know that instead of a profile, they can only temporarily whitelist the FTP links... so user decides to put his manager in the emails.

&gt; $UM: Hello $Me, I've been told by $User that the profile we're requesting doesn't exist. But I know it does exist because we had requested it two years ago for another user, I still have the form that I'd fulfilled back then.

&gt; $Me: Hello $UM, I understand that, but the process has changed since that date. And as I said to $User, we don't have any AD groups for this profile, I've also been told by the other team that there isn't any profile like that, I've however sent the details to $User for the other process regarding the whitelisting of the FTP links.


So, $UM decides to talk about it to his manager, who decides to send an email (without including our team in the loop of the email, of course) to complain about the IT Team being incompetent as always, and that user's current issue is a big emergency, as he's not able to work *(which isn't true, since $User here knows that he could access these links by switching to the public WiFi network we have here but, meh, it's too boring to do that once to download two or three apps, I guess, however this team is used to send emails like that each time we don't answer as they would like to their requests or simply each time they have an issue. Any kind of issue.)*

In the end, it turns out that the profile they needed is not the one they were requesting... and this profile isn't granting access to FTP links either.",False,151,9,ITVarangian,talesfromtechsupport
838,They told me the phone screen was turned off!,"A little backstory: I work for basically a contract IT company where we do jobs for a large variety of clients and also do in house repairs. In house we repair mainly computers and sometimes phones.

T: Hello this is M with Tech In a Box. How may I help you?

M: Hey my name is W and I brought my son's phone to them and they said the phone's screen was turned off and I need to know what needs to be done.

T: You were told your son's phone's screen was turned off? What do you mean?

M: I took my son's phone to them and they troubleshooted it and they said the phone's screen was turned off but it wont come on.

T: Who is they M'am?

M: Major Cellphone Provider

T: Ok can you tell me what exactly is wrong with the phone, like what all is going on with it? Not to sound rude but I just picked up the phone and Im being told what ""they"" did and said without any information on what all is going on. Can you tell me what happens when you do-

M: *cuts me off* I'll just let you talk to him.

After a moment

S: Hi I took my phone to you and a young lady troubleshooted my phone and said that the phone's screen was turned off and I wanted to see what you would do about it. 

T: When did you stop by and have us troubleshoot your phone?

S: Last Tuesday.

T: Not to be rude but I don't remember anything about someone coming in for troubleshooting a phone screen not turning on. Are you sure you don't have the wrong number?

S: Its the right number, I came to you.

T: Well normally when someone comes in we will do a few basic steps up front and then ask you to drop the phone off so we can troubleshoot. We normally never troubleshoot up front and we wouldn't just send you home with the phone not working without offering to check it in for troubleshooting. We actually don't have any women who work here and your mom said that you took it to Major Cellphone Provider. We are Tech In a Box not Major Cellphone Provider. You are very welcome though to stop by any time and check in your phone for us to take a look at it for you.

S: Thanks.

T: Thank you and have a great day.

839,Sales be selling.,"I have been lurking for a little while, always wanted to post but was a little hesitant since I feel I am not the best storyteller. That aside I felt confident enough to start with this little story that was too idiotic to keep to myself.

A little backstory, for almost 6 years I work for a medical software\-company that also sells hardware to install those programs on. Our customers are medical professionals with small networks \(Client\-Server model, mostly 1 server and a couple of workstations\).

Since a lot of our customers don't like spending a lot of money on ""unnecessary"" stuff like a decent server/workstation or an installation and configuration of new hardware through one of our technicians we from the technical helpdesk are used to the loopholes that Sales take to make a sale.

But this week we had the winner of the most idiotic conclusion to a case. It all started a couple of months ago with a customer that had a workstation that kept freezing \(PC did not react, Ctrl\+Alt\+Del did not give anything, only thing to do was a manual reboot of the PC\). My coworker, let's call him $MrIdol \(he likes to sing songs to keep the spirits high\) did everything he could to fix this problem remote \(our customers are all over the country so first line is always remote, if we can't fix it we send a technician\). Being a former technician $MrIdol used all his tricks and wisdom but was unable to fix the problem. The workstation was about 5 years old, the customer did not want a billable intervention from one of our technicians. So he decides to send the case to sales with the question to contact customer and sell a new workstation.

So what did sales do .....?

840,"""I don't care if there's a state of emergency! I need someone here now!""","LTL, FPT, XYZ, LMNOP...This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully it's entertaining enough to be worth it.


TL;DR, Always get it in writing.


I work for an events office at a university running a Campus/Student Center as well as several other satellite event locations, and part of that job includes providing tech support for meetings. Everything from setting up mics and projectors to video conferencing to basic windows troubleshooting and everything in between. I've got tons of stories from that, but I'm going to start with this one as another story here reminded me of it. (Details and timeline fudged to keep stuff anonymous.)


A couple winters back the university was going through it's re-accreditation process. For those unfamiliar with the processes the tl;dr version is it's a **Big Deal** and all the higher ups are involved including the $Chancellor's Chief of Staff (CCoS). The accreditation can affect everything from a school's grants, state, and federal funding to students applying to said university ability to get financial aid. 


We'd been leading up to this meeting for weeks. There would be a site visit with the folks from the accreditation board where they would tour the campus, meet some students at the Student Center, some official, some ""spontaneous."" The whole thing would kick off at 8 am with a conference call to other sister campuses. Everyone was completely on edge about this meeting and I was looking forward to seeing the tail end of it.


The day before the meeting it starts snowing. And it snows. And snows. *And snows.* We're talking record breaking levels here. We ended up getting dismissed from work early. The President of the University and the Vice Chancellor of HR send out the ""Don't come to work tomorrow unless you are essential personnel"" email. The Governor issues a state of emergency and says everyone except emergency vehicles should stay off the roads. I tuck in for the night content in the knowledge that my son and I will get to have a great day at home having snowball fights and building snow caves.


Well, the next morning rolls around and I wake up to my work cell ringing. I have a strict ""off-hours"" policy so I put my work cell on Do Not Disturb mode from 12 am-6 am. I've got something like 20 missed calls and texts. But now the $CCoS is calling my personal cell. I don't even know how he got my personal cell number as I only ever gave that number to my work wife. Something very bad is happening.


$me: Hello?


$CCoS: Where the *$%@ are you? Why is the Campus Center closed! Where is everyone? The accreditation officers will be here in an hour! We need to get everything up and running!


*Where do you think I am you moron? There's two feet of snow outside.*


$me: I'm at home. The Campus is closed. The governor has issued a state of emergency. I'm not allowed out on the roads.


$CCoS: I don't care! These accreditation officers are only in town today so we are going to go through with this meeting. I need the building unlocked and the conference equipment running! And we need those students that are supposed to be part of the tour.


*you serious? Half my staff are commuters. I'm not going to risk their safety and make them come in. And the ones that do live on campus, I'm not going to make them come in either, you f-ing nut job, I'd have to pay them extra to get them to come in.*


$me: Well, the video conferencing system is plug and play, and I can get facilities to clear the sidewalk but they'll probably charge extra, and I can probably get campus security to come in and unlock the building and staff the front desk, but that's another cost. As for staffing, I cannot make it in, there's two feet of snow outside my house, and a good portion of my students commute so I can't ask them to come in either as I can't ask them to risk their safety. What I can do is ask if anyone who lives on campus is willing to volunteer to come in. But that's an extra charge. And I can't promise they will want to come in.


$CCoS: Just make it happen! This is a critical meeting and **everything** has to be perfect. *Do whatever it takes to make this happen.*


$me: *Foreseeing a trap* Alright. But I'm going to need this in writing. Can you please send it to me in an email?


$CCoS: Yes. Fine. Whatever. *click*


Two minutes later, sure enough, I get an email from him. *""The Accreditation Meeting is going forward as planned. The Center needs to be open by 8am. Pull whatever resources you need to make this happen.""*


Armed with those magic words I went to work. Being in events, you have to make quick friends with Security and Facilities (and IT), so I got on the horn with both departments and acknowledged that I'd have to pay extra to get them focused on the Student Center, but I let them know that the $CCoS made it very clear that I had to get this done no matter what. Yes, there's an extra emergency charge, plus the 4 hour minimums, but we have to make it happen. Yes, I will also send this in an email so you are covered. Then I find a couple of my student staff who live in the dorms close by that were willing to come through the storm for a little extra emergency pay.


The event went off without a hitch, but the $CCoS was not happy when he got his giant bill afterwards. Fortunately, since I had just sent the bill in reply to his ""Make this happen at all costs"" email, I was in the clear.",False,1515,182,pm_me_your_fanmail,talesfromtechsupport
841,"It's on the clipboard, why can't you just delete it?","Hello TFTS! Long time lurker, very occasional commenter, and now first time poster... I do work in IT myself, but being a developer rather than a dedicated tech support, I'm usually saved from the worst these kinds of stories get. The most interaction I usually get with users is when there's a bug and I need to contact them to figure out more - And while there's some events there that consist out of stupidity, negligence, or just outright lies (or at least, ineptitude), none enough to warrant a proper tale.

That doesn't mean there can't be other sources of interesting tales that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, of course... That being family. In this particular instance, my mother. Now let me start off by making clear that I love my mom, but things can be rather... Difficult, when it comes to tech. I'd like to say that I'd help her at all times with a big smile, but things do occasionally end up rather standoffish. It's just a kind of natural result when you've tried to show her how to use copy and paste on at least ten different instances, and she still needs the occasional help figuring it out. Add that she can often be stubborn to a fault, and *trying* to help her can be an exercise in frustration. This is one of those stories.

So I'd just gotten home from work when I got called over- It was ""urgent"". (Note: urgent for my mom when it comes down to anything tech related can range from her having unplugged her pc to there being an actual problem, but that is a rare thing) So I head over, already prepared to do what is probably a five minute job, and be on my way... I found her fiddling with her phone, seeming to be frantically going through her gallery. The conversation went as follows:

ME: ""So, what's the problem?""

MOM: ""Oh ME, good thing you're here. You see, I was deleting pictures...""

I was already bracing myself at this point, figuring the worst- She deleted something she didn't want deleted and I was going to need ten minutes to explain to her that, no, I couldn't magically bring them back. This would probably not be helped by the fact that I once DID manage to bring them back, after she deleted everything and I discovered that, luckily, windows phone automatically backs all of them up to the cloud. (This was several years ago, and she got an android now and in this story) (un)fortunately however, this is not what was the problem.

MOM: ""But when I tried to delete one of the pictures, I accidentally saved it- I need you to help me delete those.""

Now I was confused. Did she, somehow, manage to copy and paste some of these pictures in another folder, when I know for a fact that she barely manages after explaining it to her..? I suppose it wouldn't be too much of a surprise, but I still needed more info.

ME: ""Okay, so... Do you remember where you saved them to?""

MOM: ""Oh, I didn't! It was the phone that did!""

So, that didn't help. I explain to her that I'm not planning on scrolling through likely thousands of pictures with her until she finds the right one, so I ask her if perhaps she could just show me what it is exactly she did. She fumbles a bit, but, luckily manages to remember what it was she did and saved us both a lot of time figuring out just what was going on. She pressed down on one of the pictures, got her little dropdown, and pressed... ""copy"". A little toast message appeared on the bottom of the screen:

""Image was saved to clipboard.""

MOM: ""There! You see?!""

Now, of course, I couldn't help but laugh a bit as I realized what happened, and I was prepared to laugh it off and explain she shouldn't worry. Mom, however, was not amused.

MOM: ""ME, this is serious, ok? I want those pictures gone.""

ME: ""Oh, well, you don't need to worry about it. If you deleted the actual picture, it should be gone.""

MOM: ""But it's not gone, it's on the clipboard."" she said, looking at me as if I were the stupid one. I could already tell this was going to be fun to try and explain.

ME: ""Mom, you don't need to worry about it. The clipboard is not a folder or anything like that, it's just like... A temporary storage, for when you want to copy files.""

In retrospect, this was a stupid explanation from me, and there were probably ten different ones I could have used that she'd have accepted at face value. Alas.

MOM: ""Okay... So how do I remove it from there?""

ME: ""You don't. It just gets removed whenever you copy something else. You'd have just deleted it when you copied that other picture.""

She seemed to pause. She didn't quite understand. She seemed skeptical. She was probably thinking I just wanted to get out and get back to playing videogames. (I mean, I did, but that didn't take away from the fact her issue was never an issue in the first place.) So, after just a couple seconds of staring at her screen...

MOM: ""Can't you just open the clipboard so I can see it myself?""

ME: ""I can't. The clipboard is not a thing you can open."" I reply. By this point, though, mom got herself convinced the clipboard **IS** something you can see- So, she wasn't having it.

MOM: ""ME, please just stop being difficult and do it. If you need to look up how to do it, I know you can do that real quick.""

So, this argument continued for at least ten minutes... As I repeated numerous times that the files she wanted gone were in fact truly gone, and she had nothing to worry about- I even showed her, again, copy and paste and how it worked. She only finally, begrudgingly accepted this ""answer"", even if she seemed very doubtful about what I had tried to explain to her.

In retrospect, I should just have taken her phone with me for about ten minutes, doing absolutely nothing before returning the ""fixed"" device.

- *some guy on a TV show*

---

In the Southern Hemisphere, we are entering the cold season. Each day, temperatures are significantly cooler than the last, and this is even more true during the hours of darkness.  
So while the temperature under the bed covers remains relatively constant, by virtue of the increased differential, it is increasingly more pleasant, more desirable to stay in bed as long as possible.

So it was with great reluctance that I sleepily snaked my arm out from under the mountain of covers to swat at the offending noise. As my brain slowly dragged itself out of sleep and higher functions returned, I recognised the sound as my work phone ringing.

I attempted to gather my scattered thoughts as I answered it.

&gt; ME: Ugh... I mean, hello?

&gt; Dispatch (D): Hey G. Did I wake you?

&gt; ME: Not at all, I'm always up at, uh... Wait, why am I awake at 5 A.M.?

&gt; D: You know *{site}*?

&gt; ME: Vaguely? They shut down a few months back.

&gt; D: Well, they've just re-opened, under new management.

&gt; ME: Let me guess - something's gone wrong for the first time since they took over, and now they're panicking, because this has literally NEVER happened before in the whole six times they've opened the site for the day.

&gt; D: You got it, man.

&gt; ME: Yeah, fine - let me finish rubbing the sleep from my eyes and I'll get down there ASAP.

&gt; D: All good - I'm still fighting the new job system, but you should have it in the app by the time you get there.

I carefully flung back the covers, taking care not to disturb my wife. I did disturb my cat, who glared obscenities at my retreating back before going back to sleep.  
Three minutes later, I was showered and dressed. I checked the new job system - the company had only started using it a few days prior - but the job had not appeared in the app. There was an email with all of the relevant information, however, so I carried on - the email clearly indicated that the entire site was offline, so urgency was about as high as it gets.

Ten minutes later, I pulled in to the site's parking lot - fortunately, it was only across town. The front door was open, so I let myself in. A young dark-skinned woman was at the counter, so I introduced myself.

&gt; ME: Hi, I'm Gambatte, from *{company}*.

This was reinforced by the branded hi-visibility vest, shirt, and baseball cap that I wore.

&gt; ME: I understand you're having some issues this morning?

From my pocket, my work phone buzzed. I ignored it, because face-to-face conversations generally take priority.

&gt; Manager (M): Oh, not any more.

&gt; ME: Really?

&gt; M: Yes, I was able to get it working - I just had to press the black button! I told the man on the phone this a little while ago.

I guessed that the buzzing was D, attempting to let me know that I no longer needed to attend - useful information to receive when you're already there. I would later discover that this guess was correct.

The sleepy part of my brain suggested turning on my heel and grabbing some more sleep before actual work hours started.  
My mouth didn't get this message, though.

&gt; ME: I see. Well, as I'm here now, I might as well check the equipment, just to see if there's anything we can do to prevent the issue from happening again.

&gt; M: Okay.

M led me into a back office. Under the desk, I could see a white six socket power board. M indicated to the RESET button on the side of it. This button was black.

&gt; M: That's what I had to press.

&gt; ME: Okay, I'll have a quick look and see what I can see.

M ducked back out to the site floor as I investigated. The power board I could see had only two plugs connected, and neither of them were for my equipment.  
Curious.  
I decided to start at my equipment, as I knew this had to have been affected. The equipment was plugged in to the multiple outlets of a single UPS, which was in turn fed power from... a black six socket power board.  
Huh. The black power board was fed power from... the white power board. Every socket on the black power board was full.  
The last socket on the black power board provided power to... another black six socket power board. Which was also completely full.

In total, one wall socket had been connected to enough daisy-chained power boards to provide 18 outlets, of which 12 were in use - and most of the remaining outlets were in prime position to be accessed by staff members.

And on these cold wintry nights, who wouldn't want to plug in a space heater...

---

As best I could determine, the overcurrent circuit in the first power board had been triggered, killing power to everything downstream. When the Manager pressed the black RESET button, she restored power, and somehow the startup/inrush current from all of the connected equipment was not enough to immediately trip it again.  
This was particularly surprising, as the UPS had provided power until it had automatically shut down, so was entering charging mode once power restored.

I pulled out my phone and snapped a few photos of the power arrangement, which I then put into an email to the new owner, along with a few words explaining how ""a temporary condition (like a heater or a vacuum cleaner being plugged in) may have easily tipped the overcurrent protection, causing the issue. Redistributing the equipment to additional power circuits may be all that is required to prevent the issue from reoccurring"", or words to that effect.

A few days later, I received the following response (verbatim):

&gt; NEW OWNER: Thanks for bringing the issue to my notice - I have 6 extra wall sockets in that same small office room; I will distribute the use of the power to the balance 6 extra wall sockets. I realise we have being using this side of the wall socket.

843,“Water is not conductive”,"You wanted more stories, I’ve got more stories.

Pre-text: I am an engineer who services and supports industrial furnaces. Foundries use our products to melt, transport, hold, and pour iron and aluminum. As a result, I work with a lot of maintenance personnel and machine operators. 

I get a call from a client. He informs me that while walking through the vault he saw a wet spot on the concrete below one of his capacitor cabinets. I tell him he probably has a small leak. The unit runs and so it’s not an emergency, but I tell him he should fix it after production ends. I also tell him he should wait 15 minutes at least after the unit turns off before touching anything to let the capacitors dissipate the energy. I don’t hear back from him, so I assume everything’s ok and go on my way. 

3 months later, I get sent to this location for a PM visit. I catch up with him and ask him if he fixed the leak. He replies, “Well funny story about that...

So we turned off the unit shortly after and one of the middle capacitors had a small leak, just like you said from the water hose. I could see it dripping down the bus plate and onto the other connection points. 

So I was waiting and I guess it was a couple minutes when I figured I’d check the temperature of the water cooling. I figure, water is not conductive, it’s ok to touch right?”

I smile a chuckle. He’s not completely wrong. Our water cooling system has a conductivity monitor that is supposed to make sure the conductivity of the water is below 60 uS. But even then it’s just reduced, as completely nonconductive water is theoretically impossible and extremely not conductive (below 20 uS) would eat away at the metal piping a lot faster. 

“Anyways, I put my hand under the plate to catch a drop and right as it’s about to fall, I see a flash and I’m on my ass. My hand hurts. My back and leg hurts. I had a burn on my finger.

“I bandage myself up and wait the 15 minutes like you said. Then tighten the hose. So it hasn’t leaked since. 

“But here’s the funny part. I get home late and I swear this is true. I walk past my TV and it turns on. Confused, I walk back across the room. It turned off. I go and wake up my wife. I show her and she laughs. For the next week, my tv would randomly turn on and off as I walked past it. “

We both laugh. How he was alive, I have no idea. If the TV thing was true, I have no idea. But I did find during my PM that the conductivity monitor had a bad power supply, and that the valve to the deionizer tank was a NC valve. Meaning for an unknown amount of time the conductivity of the water has not been monitored. 

When they finally replaced the monitor, the meter read 1500uS.

Edit: Due to a lot of questions, an explanation of uS. It is the measurement of conductivity also called Mhos. It is the basically 1 uS = 1/ 1Mohms. It is measured standardly as uS per cm at 90 degrees F. Essentially, the water is supposed to act as a huge resistor before he touched. Instead it was significantly less resistant.

844,"What? No, the email says my phone number is this!","This happened about an hour ago. Probably one of my favorite calls I've ever gotten while on call, mostly because of my customer's good sense of humor. For reference, I work at a local telco.

Call comes in while I'm trying to head out to do some errands. Phones aren't working, can't receive any calls. I sigh and call my customer back and ask him for some details on what's going on. He reports that for several months they have had trouble receiving calls and that nobody in the same area code/city can call them. He goes on to explain the reason he's porting away (leaving to another telco) on Monday is due to this and an issue with the contract terms. I let him know I'd do some testing and see what I can find since this seems like a weird thing to have never worked in the two months he's had service with us. 

I do some test calls from two of my phone switches, three carriers, and three different cities, all of which connect fine except calls to the second line but I can see the call ringing on my equipment on site (nothing picked up, RNA).

I call the guy back and let him know what I found out and he can't believe it. I end up asking him what the second line is since nothing picked up. He explains it's the fax line and then tells me the number to which I ask him to read again. The exchange was as follows:

&gt; $Me: This doesn't really make any sense man, I called from 3 different cities, three different phone systems, and three different carriers and they all complete. What's happening when people call in? Do they get an error, busy tone, or does it just RNA?

&gt; $Customer: It just RNA.

&gt; $Me: Well, I was able to complete and spoke with an older gentleman with an accent when calling the main line, but nobody picked up when I called the second. What's the second line supposed to be.

&gt; $Customer: Sounds like my father. Second line is a fax, 555-555-1024.

&gt; $Me: Wait, can you repeat that number for me?

&gt; $Customer: The fax? It's 555-555-1024.

&gt; $Me: I'm sorry but the second line we have for you is 555-555-0124.

&gt; $Customer: No way, it's definitely 555-555-1024. I was told the numbers I got from you are 555-555-1023 &amp; 555-555-1024.

&gt; $Me: I don't have those numbers programmed anywhere for you. I actually called 555-555-1023 by mistake when testing and I definitely believe nothing picks up, but it's not your phone number. Your numbers are 555-555-0123 &amp; 555-555-0124

&gt; $Customer: No those are definitely my numbers. I have an email from customer support with the numbers hang on let me find it.

He finds the email and tells me who it's from, $customer_support_rep and $sales_rep which match who he had worked with on the sale and cutover after checking some internal memos. Then he reads off the email to me, the part with the numbers anyway.

&gt; $Customer: Here it is. ""Dear $Customer, we have your new numbers now. They're 555-555-0123 &amp; 555-555-0124. Let us know if you have questions.""

&gt; $Me: Yeah, that's correct. Those are the numbers I told you.

&gt; $Customer: Huh? No they're...

845,I KNOW THE LAW!,"LTL, FTP, sorry for formatting. Sorry for long post.

Now that the formalities are over, to the story.

Many years ago i worked as a support technician and many both stupid and funny things has happened. This is one of the stories that i remember the best.

Customer calls in and has some issues with the internet connection. They just moved and had problems getting their internet started in the new apartment. This was not actually a new customer. They had just moved their connection from one place to the other. \(The customer was under a 12 month license agreement and since they the company could still deliver the service on the new address they could either just pay a fee and not use the ISP the months that are left on their agreement or the could move it and just continue it as normal\) however in this instance the customer had not remembered to actually contact customer support and informed us about the fact they are moving to the new place in time.

This caused some problems for the customer to get access to their internet since in the agreement it states that in case of a move we need to be informed 2 months in advance to have the time to send out a technician to get the old connection unplugged from the old station and the new connection connected in the new station \(DSL technology where a technician actually had to physically connect the customer in the nearest connection point\)

Normally this is something that should be handled by customer service and never actually end up in the tech department, but there i was, getting a call from a upset woman that was arguing with me that we had not gotten here internet working.

i'll be Me and the customer will be AW for angry woman.

Me: Welcome to technical support, you're talking to SirDrankTooMuch

AW: Why is our internet connection not working?! \(already upset\) 

Me: That doesn't sound good. Could you please give me a customer number or a social security number to the person owing the contract and i can check what's wrong.

AW: 1234567890. it's on my husband \(gives me husbands name\)Me: Ok, thank you. Can you just give me your address so that i can check it's the correct contract?

AW: \(gives me the address to the new apartment\)

Me: Sorry, that does not look correct. the address i can see is \(their old address\)

AW: Yeah... we just moved and i talked to the customer support yesterday about moving the connection to the new apartment...

Me: Oh, i see. Well, it can take up to 5 weeks for us to get a technician out to move this to the new apartment. Have you been in contact with us earlier and informed us about the move? 

AW: No! I haven't. but you should just be able to switch it on... just fix it! i am working from home and i need it!

Me: \(headbutts the keyboard....\) Well, sorry. I really can't, i wish i could, but this is a physical connection that needs to be connected in the station some kilometers away and that needs to be done by a technician.

AW: Well send someone out now then to get this working 

Me: Sorry... I really can't there is no one available on such short notice and this is the agreement we have with the firm that is performing this job for us...

AW: THEN YOU DO IT! I DON'T CARE! JUST GET IT FIXED!!!

Me: As i said this is not something that we can do that quickly.  this should have been reported much earlier to us.

AW: I WORK FROM HOME AND I NEED THIS FIXED! I KNOW THE LAW! MY HUSBAND IS A LAWYER!!! YOU HAVE TO FIX THIS!!!!

Me: \(smiles a bit since i know that the contract we got with the customer says they are not allowed to use the internet connection to operate any kind of business, so i try not sounding smug say to the customer\) Sorry. but this cannot be done, and we are in the legal rights to take this amount of time to move the connections between the apartments. Also it is important to know that you are not within your legal right to actually use this internet connection to work from home since this is a contract for private use only and no business.

AW: WHAT IS YOUR NAME?! I AM WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MANAGER AND I AM GOING TO SUE YOU AND CALL THE NEWSPAPERS AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET FIRED! I KNOW THE LAW MY HUSBAND IS A LAWYER AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT!!!!

Me: my name is Sirdrank. i will not give you my last name because i do not need to and you are threatening me. I will get my manager to call you back when he got time to, but it might take up to 1 week due to heavy workload at the moment.

AW:  WANT TO END THE CONTRACT AND USE ANOTHER ISP!!!!! JUST CANCEL EVERYTHING!!!

Me: That i cannot do. You are not the owner of the contract and your husband is still locked to the licence agreement for 4 more months.

At this point the customer had enough and just hung up the phone. But i can still not forget how much i loved the fact she actually used her husbands law degree to declare how she knew the law and understood the whole agreement they had entered... That ISP had a licencee agreement longer than a well known phone manufacturer we all know of due to their fruit logo.

And just as a side note and something that made my day was that i got a message from a colleague a couple of days later telling me AWs husband called in and asked about what's going on and apologized for his wife's outburst.

TL;DR: Customer calls in and yells at me for not informing the ISP about them moving and says she's going to sue me and the company since she knows the law because her husband is a lawyer. I inform the customer she is in breach of contract with what she is using the connection for and the customer hangs up.",False,149,35,SirDrankTooMuch,talesfromtechsupport
846,The bar has been lowered,"I have this story I need to get off my chest. 

I am by far not the most knowledgeable technician at my workplace. While I consider myself competent, I don't have any actual degrees or such like some of my co-workers. I've recently been promoted from first line helpdesk to second line at an IT company and as such my primary duty is knowledge transfer from 2nd to 1st line by the way of writing routines, going to meetings with coordinators and generally answering questions.

During our morning meeting where unclaimed tickets are handed out, we saw this ticket on our queue, ""User is trying to send a mail, but it is too large. Can you help us?"". Signed the 1st line Servicedesk.

Even the work area boss who is completely operative and have no deep computer or system knowledge frowned and said, ""They didn't even try to zip it? Send it back and tell them to do that.""

Later that day it came back to us with notification, ""We don't know how to do that. There is nothing about it in the routines.""

The boss for my work area said she was going to take it up on the next meeting with the Servicedesk coordinators and I thought that'd be the end of it. But later that week I got tasked with writing a routine for how to compress files.

So, I had to spend 30 minutes screenshotting, editing and writing up how to right click on a file, go to send to, compressed folder and how this is different from a normal folder. Also, how to do the same with 7-zip. Right click, 7-zip, compress to zip. To spice it up and get at least some use out of the routine I also explained how to encrypt using 7-zip.

This seriously made me worry about the future for our 1st line helpdesk. I can see how some users have no idea how to work with compression.

847,"Wanted: Keyboard, black, 102 keys","LTL,FTP and english isn't my first language so please be kind.

Background: I am a chemist, but ever since punching my first cards at school I was addicted to the binary world, too. Back mid 90s I am working at an university, doing (chemical) analytical stuff, keep machines running and get more and more IT related things shoved my way because... well, I was the only one at $department who was in this kind of things. And before you blink twice you have servers to manage and users to ~~castigate~~ support.
 
$department had several laboratory courses running over the year, students had to synthesize substances, analyze them and deliver substance and data. To do so, they needed among other things chemical grade glassware (think Pyrex), lots of it. And this stuff is really expensive. 

All glassware was handled since decades by a woman, at this time in her late 50s and her slightly younger sidekick. I will call them Lab Dragon 1 (LD1) and Lab Dragon 2 (LD2). They were very respected within $faculty because of their ability to seed fear in the hearts of young students, absolutely necessary to keep glassware losses as low as possible. Of course most of it was show, actually they would go the extra mile for 'their kids' anytime. If you want to visualize them - imagine a drill sergeant clad in a flawless white lab coat and pinned up hair.

All this glassware juggling included lots of tiresome paperwork, it took ages to sum up losses, blame the guilty and order replacements. Certainly a computer would speed up things, so it was tasked to me. I made a program for glassware inventory management, at the end you could pretty much generate every report possibly wanted with the click of a few buttons.

Easy, now the hard part: teaching LD1 and LD2 how to use the program, or I should better say how to use a PC. And a keyboard. And a mouse. Several days and lots of suppressed head-desk incidents later they are up to the task, more or less.
Fast forward some weeks: first IT-enhanced lab course running and all seems to work well, although during my visits there I notice LD1 delegates use of some program functions to LD2 most of the time. I was curious but I will not meddle with the internal affairs of our dragons, ever.

One monday I arrive at my office and want to finish setup of 3 brand new PCs, but somehow I miss one of the keyboards. Now it is not uncommon someone needs a spare one or a mouse and some people are allowed to pick up replacements from my office if they leave a note. But, no note or damaged KB this time. The 3 new keyboards were black, we only had the grayish type before so I should be able to find the missing one fast. I call the usual suspects to find out where it went, but no luck. A little lab raid yields interesting things but no black keyboard… no big drama but annoying, because I am out of spare ones - of course.


Next day I am at work early and for some reason I can’t remember anymore my office door is closed, usually its open as long as I am in.
Suddenly I hear someone tries to unlock my already unlocked door, I suspect it is the cleaner and go open it. Surprise - LD1, and a keyboard. A black keyboard.

&gt;**Baud:** Good morning! Something wrong with the keyboard of your glassware pc? Spilled your tea over it or was some clumsy student’s blood sacrificed?

&gt;**LD1:** ...

Now seeing her speechless was a very rare thing, don’t think I ever saw it before. The dragon starts to change face color too... time for a saving throw!

&gt;**Baud:** Oh come on, I am joking, I know you care for them. So you took the keyboard because...?

Meanwhile her face is colored red-purple-ish, the same color she wears when yelling at a student who broke some really expensive piece of glass.

&gt;**LD1** *finally finding her voice again***:** I... needed it.

&gt;**Baud:** Well yes, what for? The Lab PC keyboard not working?

&gt;**LD1:** No, no... it is fine. I needed it at home, so I took it from your office friday afternoon when you left. Forgot to bring it with me yesterday, unfortunately.

Now I am stumped, not long ago I had a hard time getting her to use a PC at all and now she needs a keyboard at home, maybe...

&gt;**Baud:** You got a PC yourself at home and no keyboard was included?

&gt;**LD1** *face color turning more to the red side***:** No! I just needed the keyboard!

&gt;**Baud** *blank stare, user style***:** ...?

&gt;**LD1:** Look, LD2 is so much better at typing with this thing *shakes keyboard with disgust*. This can’t be, I had to train. Obviously I can’t do that at work, so I took it home and trained typing all saturday afternoon. I am much better now!

&gt;**Baud:** ... 

Trying to imagine LD1 sitting at home and hacking away at a not connected keyboard caused some sort of mental bluescreen, took a while to reboot myself.

In the end I gave her a damaged keyboard with keys still working for her training needs, and of course I had to promise about 50 times to never tell LD2.

849,No YOU plug it in,"Awhile back I was sent out to investigate why a couple of wireless access points wouldn’t power on. The access points are PoE and located in “briefcases” so they can be easily moved around as needed. They are connected to a moving assembly line and placed inside the aircraft during final assembly. These moving assembly lines essentially consist of giant scaffolds that have power, telecom, and high pressure air lines. During line moves these are disconnected and then reconnected once everything is back in place. The process of disconnecting and reconnecting everything is easy enough, and people just have to be sure that the lines are moved out of the way during the move. 

The reason the access points wouldn’t power on is that they weren’t plugged in to anything. Not seeing any CAT5 around I grabbed some and went to reconnected everything. Underneath the aircraft are covered trenches where the network drops are located. I opened up the trench and found the ultimate cause of the network problems. Instead of disconnecting the network cable it was left in place and several tons of equipment was allowed to run over it. As a result the cabling was shredded and then because it was no longer any good it was kicked into the trench and forgotten. This process apparently happened several times. 

After several emails between managers an explanation for all this was found. Apparently the people who do the actual move were only responsible for the power and air connections but not the telecom connection, which is just a CAT5 cable that gets plugged into a RJ-45 jack on each end. Because they weren’t responsible for the network cable they just left it plugged in, let the scaffolding run over it, yanked it out, shoved it in a hole, and then blamed IT for their lack of network connection inside the aircraft. Why was it done that way? Because none of the people working the line moves is IT or an electrician, which apparently you need to be to plug in a network cable, but not the high voltage (I have no idea how high, but it’s enough to cycle large aircraft engines) power lines.

850,"Windows Servers, AD and Windiot","Hello TFTS, a very good day to all of you.

Long time lurker here, first time posting. English isn't my native language and I am not good with writing either, so excuse/correct any errors. I will post more stories if this one is received well.

&amp;nbsp;

First a bit of introduction. I am an information security specialist who works as a system administrator/security consultant for a company that provides professional services. One of our client was a large telco where we had deployed an Identity management system ($IMS). I was the resident engineer/sysadmin for the solution. I also got an opportunity to work with another system called Privileged Identity Management System ($PIMS) as a backup admin when $PIMSAdmin was not available.

&amp;nbsp;

This story involves 2 systems, $PIMS and Active Directory ($AD). $AD was huge in this environment. Almost every application was configured to authenticate with $AD and the password vault for these system accounts was $PIMS. 

&amp;nbsp;

The telco had outsourced IT operations to another company. They only cared about a 3-letter abbreviation called SLA. This outsourced IT disliked security and specially hated the teams I was involved with ($IMS and $PIMS teams). Some of the it was justified as once they happened to ignore security procedures which later resulted in a large breach (perhaps a tale for another day) due to which the folks in security took away their 24/7 admin rights which started affecting their beloved SLAs. Basically, they only got admin rights when they needed it and involved approvals from upper management.

&amp;nbsp;

There was a major downside to this. Any downtime on any application managed by IT was thrown at the $PIMS team claiming its $PIMS fault for locking a system account or updating its password (which by the way, never happened).

&amp;nbsp;

The cast for this tale will be:
&gt;
*$HD: Help Desk, the unsung heroes who face end-users.*
&gt;
*$WinLead: Team lead for Windows Team. Windows Team manages Windows servers and Active Directory. $WinLead is a friendly guy who always discussed on phone before sending emails.*
&gt;
*$Windiot: A member of the windows team who I doubt even knew what he was doing. Senior guy, loves to throw others under the bus.*
&gt;
*$J: Me.*

&amp;nbsp;

One fine day I was conducting some tests in my lab for new features when I got a call from the Help Desk ($HD).
&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
$HD: Hey $J, we just provisioned a user in $IMS but the $AD account creation process didn’t trigger. Could you check if something is wrong?
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
$J: Sure I’ll take a look and get back to you as soon as I can.
&gt;
$HD: Thanks.

&amp;nbsp;

I disconnect the call and start my usual troubleshooting. An outlook notification popped up. There’s an email from $Windiot claiming almost every production system is down because their corresponding $AD system accounts cannot authenticate with $AD. Also demanded that we fix this immediately. 
&amp;nbsp;

His simple mind flows with: authentication means password, password means $PIMS, $PIMS means blame $PIMSTeam.
&amp;nbsp;

cc’d in the email were my boss, $WinLead and every single director from IT and Security.

&amp;nbsp;

First, I checked $IMS as managing that is literally my job. Rest of the things can wait. As $HD claimed, the $AD account provisioning for new user was stuck in processing for over 10 minutes. I remoted to the server and restarted the service which provisioned $AD accounts (have you tried turning it off and on again). The service did not start and threw an authentication error. 

&amp;nbsp;

I logged in to $PIMS immediately and checked the password to the $IMS provisioning account. It was the same password. In the $RDP session, under service properties, I just re-entered the same password and clicked apply. I was greeted with a message “the account $IMSaccount is now granted to login as a service”. 

&amp;nbsp;

After this I started the service, and hurray it started successfully. I checked $IMS and the pending queue cleared. I called $HD and told them that the issue is fixed. $HD were happy and went about their way.

&amp;nbsp;

Now this was weird because all these service accounts were part of a domain group ($LoginAsService) which granted rights to login as a service on all windows servers. This was pushed as a GPO. I’m no windows expert but can use google. I looked up on GPOs, opened up group policy on the server and noticed $IMSaccount is allowed to run as a service. But no sign of $LoginAsService group anywhere. There was some random account (PROD\$random) which was allowed to login as a service. (Memories of this part are a bit hazy, as this happened a few years back and I don’t remember what exactly each setting was).

&amp;nbsp;

I decide to run gpupdate /force to get an updated GPO from $AD. After that, $IMSaccount disappeared from the list. I restart the service and it throws the same error. I conclude that the GPO is causing this problem for which most of the production systems are down. Not my problem, but I have to deal with it thanks to $Windiot’s email.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I really don’t like talking to $Windiot as he is uncooperative. So I replied to his email.
&gt;             
*Hey $Windiot, was there any recent update in Group Policies? If yes, could you check if any setting is removing $LoginAsService Group from allowed users/groups to login as service?*
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
*Regards,*
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*$J*

&amp;nbsp;

I didn’t want to point out the exact problem to $Windiot since there was upper management cc'd. As much as I disliked him, I didn’t want him to get into trouble because of me.

&amp;nbsp;

Within a few minutes, I get a reply:
&gt;***No this password $PIMS problem, security should fix.***

&amp;nbsp;

I am not kidding, that was the actual text of the email (top management is still cc’d). I lost my shit at this point and decided to reconsider the part where I didn’t want him to get into trouble because of me.

&amp;nbsp;

I picked up the phone and dialed $WinLead. 
&gt;$J: Hey $WinLead did you check your email?

&gt;$WinLead: Yeah $Windiot is claiming $PIMS is causing all sorts of issues.

&gt;$J: I looked into it and I think it’s a GPO. Was anything updated recently?

&gt;$WinLead: Yeah $Windiot wanted to allow $random to login as a service on all servers, so he pushed a policy this morning. This is for Project Random.

&gt;$J: So yeah that policy has overridden the existing GPO which allowed members of $LoginAsService to run services. Can’t you guys do something like append it to the existing settings on a server instead of overwriting it?

&gt;$WinLead: Yeah that’s how it was supposed to be. $Windiot probably messed up.

&gt;$J: Well when I gave hints about it to $Windiot, he replied saying its on us. Shall I rip him a new one?

&gt;$WinLead: Well he went aggressive on you, so go ahead. I’ve had enough of $Windiot.

&gt;$J: Great! Thanks. I will mention relevant parts of our conversation in the email.

&gt;$WinLead: Sure, no worries.

&amp;nbsp;

I took screenshots of everything I did during troubleshooting and replied back to $Windiot. Towards the end of it I wrote:
&gt;
*So as per my investigation of this issue, it appears to be happening due to some GPO and not $PIMS. Please check for the changes in Group Policies. I spoke with $WinLead about this and he said GPOs were updated today for Project Random.*

&amp;nbsp;

After a few hours I receive an email from an $ITDirector apologizing for the mess $Windiot had caused. I never received another email from $Windiot again. He still worked there, but avoided messing around with me.

&amp;nbsp;

*TL;DR: $Windiot asks me to do the needful. I do the needful and rip him a new one.*

851,The Early Access game I was playing crashed? Must be the drivers!,"So I had a guy come in recently. He was playing a Steam Early Access Game. Apparently it crashed. He came to the realization that  he should probably update the graphics drivers, because that must be the problem.

His laptop has both intel HD XXXX integrated graphics and a much bettery RADEON graphics card. 

So, he decided to use some HP tool for updating his drivers. It updated BIOS, PCIe, intel HD, and RADEON drivers to more recent versions. He then realized his games were running slowly, so he then reset his computer to factory settings and then re-updated his drivers using the same damn HP driver tool. Then he apparently tried the 'update your drivers' option in Device Manager, because (as you all know) that's the best way to solve game crashes. Apparently it somehow actually managed to update one of his drivers. 

As a result, his games are slow as fuck. He has 1/3 the FPS he was getting before.

856,How do phone work?,"One of my primary job responsibilities at my place of employment is overseeing and supporting our building's VoIP phones and their connection to the campus Telecom service. (Skype for Business/Lync with Exchange integration) This ranges from installation of new employee's equipment to setting up temporary call centers for ~~We got your donation, want to make another one?~~ ""Thank you calls.""

A few weeks ago, one of our internal departments was split to occupy two separate office spaces as well as take on separate duties. Prior to this, they had a main phone number that had served both offices just fine. The receptionist and her assistant would answer the calls, figure out which sub-team needed to get it, and send it on. Now, however, these calls were going to two separate office spaces, so a better solution was needed. 

After meeting with the department and convincing them to trust me..... (They agreed to my proposal, thank God), it was decided that a phone tree would be implemented to allow callers to dial the same ""Main"" number as before, but then be able to choose which sub-department to get transferred to.

Phone tree is set up and tested, custom recording is done to cover up the ""robot"" voice, and I type up a very nicely formatted email that covers all the changes and what they would mean for the staff. 

We're talking several paragraphs, nicely spaced, bold font on the important parts, the whole nine yards.

Today, I get an email from the receptionist that goes something like this:

Copied Text from my previous email: **$OLDMAILACCOUNT will no longer receive voicemails.** (Since two new mail accounts are now being used, one for each sub-department)

Email from receptionist: **Does this mean I need to be able to open $OLDMAILACCOUNT to check for any voicemails?**

857,Are you sure you are an electrician?,"I don’t know if this fits here cause I’m not tech support, but I hope it’s close enough. I’m an electrical engineer that works field support for industrial furnaces. I have a lot of stories of stupid maintenance personnel, but this is my favorite. If you guys feel this stuff can fit here, I may share more. 


So we receive a call from a client. They are having the most common problem with our furnace. They have a ground problem. Usually this means the aluminum or iron has gone through the lining so we start there. We instruct the maintenance personnel to check the lining of the furnace for penetrations and if it’s not that, remove the yokes one by one to inspect that. We tell them to call us back after. 


Couple hours later the client calls us back.


Client: It’s not in the furnace.

Me: Well we don’t know that for sure yet. It still can be. There’s one more step.

Client: It’s not.

Me: Well we can prove it by removing one side of the bus. 

Client: The what?

Me: The bus bars. 

Client: What?


Internal sigh. Apparently this guy has little training on our units despite having a contract for training every 6 months. 


Me: The two metal tubes that conduct the electricity from the power supply to the furnace.

Client: Oh. Yeah. How do I do that again?


Trigger face palm. 


Me: Unbolt it above the capacitor cabinet and add insulation paper between the bars. 

Client: That sounds like a pain. 

Me in my best salesman voice: Well if you want we can retrofit an isolation switch in there at some point, which will ease the troubleshooting in the future. 


He grumbles. 


Me: But for now, this is what you need to do. Call me back after. 


I hear back from the client the next morning. 


Client: It’s still grounding out. 

Me: Bus disconnected?

Client: Yes. 

Me: Ok that means we have isolated the problem to the power supp-

Client: We need a field service guy. 

Me: There’s one more step-

Client: Just get here. 

Me: He’ll just sit on his butt the first day while he makes you go through the procedure. 

Client: I’ve got a P.O.  just get out here. 


Surprised, and a little frustrated, I go to my boss with the P.O. so he can pick out the guy who’s gonna go.  It’s Friday, so the client won’t be able to get parts, and my boss sends the weekend quote, trying to talk him into finishing the procedure himself. He has none of it. Boss tells me I’m going since I started it. Reluctantly, I book my flight to Kentucky. 


I show up the next day on site, ready to get to work. I meet the guy I was on the phone with and ask him if he can partner me up with an electrician since its an electrical issue. To which he replies, “I am an electrician.”


I contain my shock, and proceed to the furnace. 


Me: There’s a slug in there. 

Client: Yeah, you took too long. It hardened up. 

Me: How can you tell if there’s penetrations with a full furnace?

Client: The metals all there! I can’t see any penetrations, can you?


I sigh. This is bad, as remelting the furnace like that will cause the metal to expand and damage the lining. I explain to him this and despite his concerns of the expense, we move on. I now obviously know he did nothing I had asked him to, but with a full furnace I can’t start there. 


We go downstairs, and rather obvious by now, the bus is intact.


Me: You said you disconnected the bus. 

Client: Well, it’s water cooled and I didn’t want to get things wet. 

Me: That’s why you disconnect it between the cooled lines.

Client: What?

Me: I need you to disconnect it here. 


I point at a section of the bus where the water lines change out. He tries to get me to do it, but I can’t fly around with wrenches that big in my box, so he reluctantly does it himself. Afterwards we turn it on and luckily the ground stayed. It’s in the power supply, which means we can find it! Unfortunately the ground meter is up two flights of steps, so checking it every few minutes would be a pain. 


I ask if he has a spare ground meter, and luckily he does. He runs and gets it and it’s our 0-10V style meter. Awesome. We head downstairs. 


Me: Ok. Next step is checking the capacitors. 

Client: Oh. Wait. How do you check a cap?

Me: Well you have to pull it out of circuit one by one and turn it on again. That’s why I had you get the spare meter. I need you to wire it up in parallel with the one upstairs. 

Client: parallel?

Me: Parallel.

Client: How?


What I wanted to say was “Are you sure you are an electrician?”

I proceeded to explain to the client what the difference between series and parallel was, and then we found a bad capacitor. We disconnected the capacitor from the circuit and he was able to run again. 

On my way out of the plant, I informed him that while it’s safe to run without one or two capacitors in circuit, it won’t be the ideal resonance frequency and prevent him from going to full power. It would reduce his efficiency. That he really needed to buy a new one if he wanted to run at full power. He said he understood and sent me on my way. 

Not a month later, I get a call from my boss. Apparently he was complaining cause his 1MW furnace was only running at 937KW and doesn’t know why. 

He has yet to replace the bad capacitor. ",False,2245,275,TraitorousTraveler,talesfromtechsupport
858,The Time Lead Cut Traders off from Profit,"So, this is one that I remembered after conducting an interview yesterday for an IT intern position where the chat at the end became more relaxed and I started remembering some of the more hilarious and frustrating times at my first job post-graduation.


***Background***

My first gig out of college was working for an international, multi-billion dollar news agency (henceforth known as **$EvilCorp**) that also had a financial division that provided an application for ~~a bunch of spoiled, over-grown brats~~ finance folks to do trades, calls, puts, research and analysis, view ticker info, etc. I helped support the back-end which consisted of about 3,000 Linux-based market data servers around the world located at customer co-los or our data centers all being fed from said data centers by dedicated circuits (ISDNs all the way up to OC48 connections) at a Tier II/Tier III level. In other words, we dealt with issues that affected multiple users at a client or multiple clients --- or as I liked to call the group I belonged to, ""The 'shit hits the fan' extinguisher."" Despite the stress and starting to grey at a young age, it was fun (most of the time) as hell and I learned more there than I did in college.

We were a 24/7 shop due to the global nature of our industry and the various exchanges around the world. My shift was from 7am to 3pm which I both loved and hated: the quiet before the ~~daily shitstorm~~ trading day started, avoiding rush hour on the commute, lack of sleep due to being constantly on-call, starting to grey within my first year there, and leaving the office before the average Joe/Jane in the professional world. It meant I could avoid the crowds in bars after a hard day most of the time or the end-of-day rush hour to get home.

Finally, we had a monitoring system with a GUI written in [TCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) back in the 90s with a Java back-end. As crappy as it was even on the best days, it was pretty damn thorough. We had alerting set up for the servers on everything from resource utilization to process' statuses to thresholds of bad web requests (400s and 500s, namely) to hardware as well as the network side of things which consisted of both the client dedicated circuits and our data centers' infrastructure. There was barely anything that we didn't know about and that which we didn't we simply wrote new hooks and rules for alarm triggers. The alarms that popped up were all color-coded according to severity, which was very hipster-y of us since the U.S. would go on to use almost the same exact scheme immediately after 9/11 (take that, [Tom Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Ridge)!). This monitoring system was more or less our sun and our team revolved around it.

***The Characters***

$Ego = ```whoami``` (a.k.a., me)

$Cyril = echo ""Older co-worker close to early retirement who worked the same shift as me. Huge fan of Archer and a lively fellow.""

$ISPTech = echo ""Random ISP tech on the phone.""

$MS = Our monitoring system. Not a character, but at times it seemed to obtain sentience for brief periods for the sole purpose of spiting us, the team.

$Hammond = echo ""One of the two dayshift managers. A Ukrainian guy not much older than I was, he was a hard-ass but one of the most techie guys I knew both in and out of $EvilCorp. Also my mentor during this time with a tough-love friendship.""

$Troll = echo ""One of the evening shift managers, even though he came later in the morning than the morning managers. Laid back guy who loved to troll the other managers and subordinates, sometimes too much. But, all in all, we had plenty of laughs with him.""

***The Story***

I walked into the office at the unholy time of 6:30am when I spoke two words worth of greetings to my two overnight colleagues through a stifled yawn and bloodshot eyes. As per my built-up morning routine at this point (9 months after my start date), I dropped my messenger bag off at my cube and shuffled my way to the office kitchen to make myself some chai which I consumed two cups of before making a third and going back to the main floor. Being on the dawn shift that takes over from the graveyard one, I always chatted with the overnight shift about life, love, and setbacks... and also the hand-off for any outstanding issues, tickets, or calls that might have arisen during their shift or that carried over from the day before. Luckily, our monitoring system and all else was quiet aside from stuff that was up there for the last 24 hours plus so the overnight analysts said, ""Kthxbai,"" and bolted for the elevators to sleep in their own ~~coffins~~ beds.

A few minutes after they left, $Cyril strolled in through the door, chipper as ever at this unholy hour with his poor imitation of The Count's laugh. We both finally got settled in our adjacent cubicles and started combing over everything the graveyard shift passed on to see what we could actually make progress on at 7:05 in the morning. There wasn't much apart from a few follow-up emails bugging a variety of clients' techs for the latest status of action that they had to take on their end before we proceeded further (read: telling them to do their jobs so we could do ours and meet SLAs before being scorned for not doing so). Some time later, though, was when things *really* began to pick up.

&gt; $Cyril: Hey $Ego, uhhh, is $MS spazzing on my terminal or is this legit?

My head swiveled to the third monitor on my right that was hooked up to a thin client from where we accessed all our servers and networking hardware via SSH as well as where $MS was on display. The monitoring system was bleeding red, pushing all the less recent alarms out of view in its narrow window like a messenger wading through the crowd warning of the marching Persian horde. The alerts were for a slew of circuits, all in all about 20. Now, most of our clients had redundant circuits so these were a mix of primaries and secondaries that went down but there were a few smaller, stubborn ones that only had one line for their feeds so these guys were down hard. $Cyril and I broke into instinctually into our ~~Spartan~~ job training and started pulling up site diagrams, remoting into routers to test connectivity to make sure there weren't any false alarms. Unfortunately for $Cyril and I, they weren't false positives, *but* there was one silver lining in all of this: most of the circuits had a common ISP. The ones that didn't, in these cases, were usually assumed that even though the circuit was managed by another ISP, they probably had a hand-off to the affected ISP somewhere along the path. Once we confirmed that the lines were actually down, $Cyril and I flipped a coin to see who would get stuck with calling the circuits out to the ISP. Needless to say, I got stuck with the task.

I started creating tickets for each circuit under every &gt;affected client in our CRM/ticketing system, Siebel (if you've ever used Siebel, you may think of it as the digital devil incarnate of ticketing systems much like my group and I did). There I was, cloning and editing tickets while on hold with the ISP when, after creating the second to last ticket, I finally got a human being on the phone.

&gt; $ISPTech: Thank you for calling $ISP, can I get your company and circuit ID?

&gt; $Ego: Hi, this is $Ego from $EvilCorp. We're seeing a metric ton of circuits that went down about 15 minutes ago. **starts listing off the circuit IDs**.

&gt; $ISPTech: Is it alright if we do some non-intrusive testing?

&gt; $Ego: Think it's safe to say that this is something larger.

&gt; $ISPTech: ... Right. Is there an internal ticket number I can reference?

&gt; $Ego: **finally getting around to creating the ""master"" ticket to which all the previously created ones will be linked to** Ticket number from our side is 0123456789.

It was 8am now by this point which the time that $Hammond walked into the office, almost passing by me and $Cyril when he paused to look at the giant 80-inch screen that loomed over what we called ""the platform"" (I'll explain this later) with a raised eyebrow and his coffee halfway to his mouth.

&gt; $Hammond: Is anyone ---

&gt; $Ego: **raises hand**

&gt; $Hammond: Do we have a hot topic? (*Aside*: ""Hot topic"" in our nomenclature was basically a master ticket to which multiple tickets of the same issue for different clients were linked to)

&gt; $Ego: It's 01234556789; I'll email it over.

&gt; $Hammond: Have the clients been informed?

&gt; $Ego: I just got off the phone with $ISP, so I haven't had a chance to. We do have a few single circuit sites that are down.

&gt; $Hammond: $Cyril, call the sites and see what shape they're in.

Phone calls and emails went out to the affected clients to let them know what was going on. Naturally, the ones who were in single circuit sites were in a panic and we (me and $Cyril) had to calm them down and manage their expectations to let them know that this was out of our direct control, thus they would ~~have to untwist their drawers~~ be patient. Privately, though, we were thinking, ""These folks are idiots for not having any redundancy."" Now, because this impacted so many clients, it was unofficial policy to ~~pester~~ follow up with the ISP(s) on an hourly basis for the latest status and possibly see if there was something that we could do from our end to alleviate the issue in the interim. If you've ever worked with an ISP in a B2B capacity, this tends to be near impossible as they'll insist that their techs are working on the issue along with few technical details about the problem. Fast forward to about 10:30, we finally received an update that was worth communicating to our clients: they had found an above-ground backbone line that had the issue and they were dispatching techs to the site to fix it up.

Okay, fine. So, me, as the owner of the issue/master ticket, got to twiddle my thumbs even faster. While looking at $MS some time later, the open cuts in my day known as the red, critical alarms began disappearing in semi-quick succession. I reached out to $ISP to get a root cause and the conversation went like this (paraphrasing as this was years ago):

&gt; $Ego: Hi, this is $Ego from $EvilCorp calling about ticket $ISPdigitdigitblahblah.

&gt; $ISPTech: Give me a moment to get it pulled up... Reading through it now...

Then $ISPTech starts bursting out in wholehearted laughter.

&gt; $Ego: ... Dare I ask the root cause?

&gt; $ISPTech: So, the trunk line that was affected was severed by a stray bullet.

&gt; $Ego: **face starts contorting to avoid bursting out into laughter at this point** Well... that's a new one.

After I hung up with $ISPTech and started updating my ticket, $Troll walks over to get an update ($Hammond was down for a smoke which, sadly, I couldn't join him for; our smoke sessions served as unofficial meetings and status updates and general chat).

&gt; $Troll: So what did $ISP say?

&gt; $Ego: A bullet cut the fiber line.

&gt; $Troll: ... Let the clients know, but be more, uh, euphemistic about it.

The final calls and emails went out, but I couldn't resist the constant muting of my phone to try and contain my laughter. The clients that were affected were on the opposite side of the country, hence why they were impacted the most.

TL;DR: None. Read at your own leisure. :)

Typical of the big consulting firm I'm working for, I only know my little slice of the project- social engineering. I've been tasked with trying to trick the targeted employees of HealthCo to either give me credentials via phishing emails or insert USB drives with a little 'phone home' script into their workstations.  

I'm very comfortable with the former, but my Java skills aren't up to snuff, so I'm spending a lot more time modifying a coworker's java app to phone home when clicked, but not break anything else. I am reminded why I'm not a Java developer and just change the icon on some HTML that will call an unique web bug (a 1x1 clear pixel) that will identify the USB drive. To ensure maximum clicks, I name the doc 'Payroll.xls.html'.  
 
I'm planning on sending the phishing emails a day or two before I'm on-site, where I'll drop the drives, wait a day and write my report. I fly out and drive my shitty rental car to HealthCo's offices the night before. I drop a third of the drives in the parking lot, then piggyback someone going into the office to drop them around the building. I find my way back to my consultant kennel. Sadly, the only restaurant walking distance from my hotel is an Applebee's, so Brewtus and I start writing the filler for HealthCo's report over some rubbery chicken wings.  
 
The next day, I check and see that I'm around 50% for my phish and about a third of my USB devices have been plugged in. I also see an email from the client. They have some _grave_ concerns about our test and want to talk about it.  
 
I throw my suit on and take my 'other fine car' to HealthCo's offices. I'm escorted to the Director of Security's offices. They've collected a bowl of my thumb drives like the least appetizing candy dish ever. There's also a suspiciously clean cut security engineer here with a laptop and a smile that tells me he thinks he's got me dead to rights.  
 
Director:""We specifically asked that you not use malware for your social engineering test. Because of your malware, we ended the test and emailed everybody to bring us any drives they find.""
 
me:""We didn't generate malware. We decided to go with a HTML file instead of a Java dropper. For compatibility reasons.""  
 
Security Engineer(gesturing at the spreadsheet on his laptop):""Your malware captured PHI to the drive. That's outside the rules of engagement""  
 
me:""I assure you- I didn't write anything to break into your systems. I wrote a simple web page. Wait a minute, let me show you something""  
 
I reached into the bowl and showed them a few of 'my' drives. Each had been marked with a felt tip pen. Drives intended for the parking lot got two dots, while drives dropped inside the building had a small line. It was a way to make sure I spread them effectively without losing track.  
 
I showed the Director and the engineer my marks. The Director looked unamused while the engineer looked like he wanted to wish one of my marks onto the drive he had.

861,Have you tried turning THAT off and back on too?,"I'm going to try and fail to keep this tale short.

We got called in on a Sunday for a Critical level ticket. This customer has a PROD database with two machines in a failover cluster so that if one dies the other takes over, but both machines are connected to a single Storage Area Network (SAN). The way we configured it, the SAN was basically a big external hard drive. At about the same time, a flurry of about 30 emails from our monitoring software came in, which summed up to ""Two servers shut down"".

We immediately tried to remote in - failed, of course - then used a very nice hardware-level remote console tool through the network at our datacenter that is supposedly just like being there with a keyboard and mouse, but saw only a blue screen of death indicating a memory dump.

Both servers had restarted at around 9 AM for unclear reasons, both refused to start up again - lingering on a boot screen for hours on end. Even when we tried to boot to the installation CD and called an expensive tech support line, the system just wasn't responding at all. It literally took 45 minutes for it to load the installation CD.

This is a production system which is $Client's core product, and it was down without explanation or warning on a Sunday - and STILL down on Monday - so the whole time $Client is shouting our ears off with emails, phone calls, tickets, etc. $Boss ran interference, which I was extremely grateful for.

Troubleshooting attempts continued. Left alone, the machines WOULD eventually boot after several hours, our monitoring software celebrated - for about twenty minutes, and then they crashed again. Long story short, we didn't get much sleep, continually troubleshooting, and about 28 hours later we managed to extract a memory dump file and dig through it to find that the system was shutting down by a watchdog trying to protect the system from data corruption, because it couldn't read the database files...

...Of course. We were idiots. We'd restarted the machines themselves a dozen times, but we never checked the SAN that they were both connected to. The SAN, in a different rack than the servers, was flashing amber lights at us.

It still took another two hours of trying to gracefully recover the SAN, terrified of data corruption (It sounds a Bad Idea to shut down a SAN with a cache error), but in the end $Boss decided 'screw it, turn the whole thing off and back on again, can't get any worse than PROD database down for a whole day'. Thirty minutes later, everything was working again. I drove home, fielded some emails from relieved client, and slept for 10 hours straight.

I'm about 8-9 months working as a tier 1 within my University's IT department. For the most part, I'm usually dealing with patient faculty and staff members, and most of our callers are very kind. We mostly deal with the University's online accounts for O365, online services, etc, and general tech support issues for anyone associated with the University. The call I will be discussing today revolves around a compromised email account. With a compromised account, we're supposed to talk with the user and try to identify the source of the compromise, have them reset their password, go over good security practices, etc.


So I come into work around 8:30 AM Monday morning, and the first thing I notice is the amount of compromised users is exceptionally high. You see, that weekend we suffered from a pretty high quality phishing attack. An email with the typical ""Your __ university  account in danger of expiring. Please click this *sketchy link* to redeem your account"" had been spreading around like a disease. This phishing email looked way more convincing than usual, and a lot of people were falling for it.


Getting to the story here: My first call of the day is from an angry student, lets call him 'ignorant student' or IS for short. Now it's been a few weeks so details might not be exact, but I know the gist.


&gt;*ring ring* 

&gt;Me: Thanks for calling _university IT, how can I help?

&gt; IS: Okay so like I don't know what the deal is but I can't log into my account. I need to be able to send emails to my professors right now or my grades depend on it. This is absolutely ridiculous, I don't know what the problem is. ID # is #####

I look up his account, and as expected his account is compromised.

&gt; Me: Alright sir it does look like your account is compromised. This means that somebody has your password, and could have had malicious intentions. We can take care of this, we just need to go over a few things. First I need you to use the ""forgot password?"" button to create a new one. Do you know what may have caused your password to be released?

&gt;IS: That's bulls-t. I don't want to reset my password again because you guys already made me change it the other day in **that email**. I have s-t to do. I'm a student and I have tests and assignments to work on. I don't know why this is my problem whatsoever when it's obviously y'alls fault for being hacked so easily. Like that's just ridiculous. 

&gt; Me *dying internally*: Sir we can get through this process quickly, I just need you to be patient with me as I go through the procedure. The measures we are taking here are for your benefit, and the security of your account. Can I please have you create a new password.

&gt;IS: Fine. 

&gt;Me: Alright, now while you do that I'm just going to give some security advi-

&gt;IS: Um dude I don't know how you expect me to change my password while you're talking at the same time. Since I've already had to change it before I don't even know what I'm even going to change it too now, and you talking in my ear is making it really hard to come up with one.

&gt;Me: ok. 

So I already know that he is got that phishing email confused with a password change request from us, and he obviously fell for it.  This guy was being so rude to me, and I knew he wouldn't respond well when I told him he gave his password away like a fool, so I tried to approach it with caution.

&gt; IS: *annoyed tone* Ok I finally changed it, now take the block off my email account right now.

&gt; Me: Alright, really quick it's important we go over some online safety tips so this doesn't happen again. Have you received any emails recently asking you to click a li-

&gt;IS: Ok dude I don't know anything about technology and personally, I don't care at all. I'm not going to listen to any of this, so don't even bother. I need my email, and I need it now. This is obviously not my problem, and it's ridiculous that you guys put responsibility on me. I need to send email's to professors, and I swear to god, if my grade is affected because of this nonsense, I will be taking further action with people higher up than you. 

LOL. Good luck with that.

&gt;Me: Ok. I'll go ahead and process the ticket.

&gt;*click*


Now if this dude wasn't so rude to me, I would've actually continued on with the procedure, but at that point I wasn't trying to be helpful. We were supposed to discuss why his account was compromised, and discuss safety measures so it doesn't happen again. I was also supposed to have him check his mailbox rules and make sure there wasn't anything suspicious going on. After that, I'm supposed to mark that we did all those things on the ticket, then it goes into a queue to be reviewed by tier 2. Only then, will the email block be removed, and it usually takes a few hours. When I was updating the ticket, I made sure to *not* mark all the required fields. I also added a note documenting his attitude and inability to cooperate. My day started off terribly because of this guy, and I wasn't about to improve his. 


TL;DR: Call to take care of your compromised account, but fail to cooperate in any way while being a total jerk? Get used to not being able to send emails buddy.

865,Disconnected,"I have a story as a user of tech support, I hope that's okay. 

A few years back both me and me brother went back to my parents place for some family time \(We're both early twenties, both left for university. So we're all a bit excited to be seeing each other again\). My father is not home and we decide to watch a movie together with my mother. However my brother quickly finds out that the television is not working, all we get is a blue screen. Both my brother and me take a look and check for connecting wires, but can't find the issue. So we decide to call tech support. 

MY mother says to call from the landline as it's the cheapest, so I'm on the couch taking the call and relaying everything the guy on the other end says to my brother who is crawled half into the cupboard we use to hide the mess of wires and gaming consoles surrounding the television. 

We're having a pretty good time doing all this, my mother has left for the kitchen to make popcorn and occasionally shouts to us for updates, while me and my brother are joking around together trying to get this fixed. The tech support man meanwhile seems to be enjoying himself too as I describe my brothers efforts to him. 

We try several different things, but nothing seems to work. 

So after a while the tech support man says that it might be a good idea to just pull the plug and then try to turn it back on again. Me and the tech support man joke about this ancient remedy while my brother tries to find the right wire in the mess. Then brother shouts to me from the depths of the cupboard that he found it. 

Brother to me: 'So I just pull it?'

Me to tech support: 'So he just pulls it?'

Tech support: 'Yes.'

Me to tech support: 'Okay he is doing it… now!'

Brother to me: 'How long do we wait before we plug it back in?' Me to Tech support: 'How long do we wait before we plug it back in?

Are you still there?

Hello?'

Now I imagine this tech support man, probably near the end of his shift. Joking with us but also trying to keep it professional. Sitting in his desk chair while I describe the mess of wires to him and my brother knocking things over, with my mother occasionally offering comments screamed form the kitchen like : 'Ahh, so that is what those lights are for? ' And then he tells us to pull the plug. I say 'now! ', and the next thing he hears is just: bleep bleep bleep…

Because both me and my brother completely forgot we were calling on the landline \(because who the hell calls on a landline anymore?\) and the landline is plugged in with the same main plug as the tv. So when he pulled the main plug from the wall, we disconnected the call as well.

Of course when we realized our mistake it took a few minutes to calm down the laughter before we felt confident enough to call into tech support again…",False,135,19,serotonineoverdose,talesfromtechsupport

869,Tales from Desktop Support - The willing student who couldn't. ​,"This is my origin story, it's laid out in chapter format and I seek to share something different because there is nothing new on [my cutover story yet] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/87as24/the_cutover_part_1/)

$Me - IT student, really really good with computers and networks already, couldn't take Senior/4000 level classes as a freshman due to some CompSci rule apparently.   

$Systems - Grouchy, didn't really fix anything to the public eye, somehow unstable DHCP using public IP's internally and 6 DNS entries per IP was a normal configuration.  

$ITSec - Had some very interesting ideas about network security.
$NetTeam - Smart, overloaded, at the mercy of someone else calling the shots.
$CIO - Got problems somewhat sorted out, definitely better than the previous 2 years.    
$Bradford - Actual name of the NAC, it's terrible and very forgetful implementation.      

This was the story, campus network generally was bad, when it worked, it was okay, but there were many days where no one could get online, sometimes it was the fault of IT, usually just DHCP dying, and lastly because of the magnetic attraction fiber has with heavy equipment - [as it is SCP-3709 compliant] (http://nn5n.com/index.php?language=English&amp;prefix=scp&amp;object_number=3709&amp;postfix=en&amp;page=object&amp;range=1-99&amp;page_type=current) it's great read and it explains why fiber gets cut so much.   

Problems would always manifest themselves in the Fall/Autumn semester which was the freshmen flood of new students.

I immediately recognized the problem even before I started - DHCP scope/pool exhaustion!
IT was informed promptly.  
IT did not succeed in improving the situation.  
Off and on the network would go, round and round IT would go, never to stop or make anything much better.      
  
One time, at a student banquet, we got to meet various upperclassmen and visit the job fair, one guy was talking in an IT group about the student who kept hammering on them to fix the internet.  
\*I introduced myself as that student*
He responded in a joking manner, so you're the one who kept telling me how to do my job!  
I have ideas, I know of ways that work, trying to help \*shrug*    
  
So, I applied and made it on a helpdesk position at the school, never did make it to Systems or NetOps, but I rocked that helpdesk and was assigned team lead to ~~boss around~~ teach interns what it's like to wrangle computers.    
  
A year or so later, a wild IT Security officer appears!
They host an open student forum about various concerns and making improvements for the campus. I ask about getting off of public addresses internally, she says due to various compliance reasons, they can't do that yet.    

$Me - Ooookay... can you at least fix DHCP to not crash every week?    
$S - Uhhhh, work in progress...     

A few months later due to $ITSec's decisions...     
$Me - Hey guys, do you have email?    
Jack - No...   
Steve [from a previous story about a jar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/75ycz9/tales_from_desktop_support_the_jar/) 
No...   
  
Jack inquires in the weekly IT meeting, $ITSec had changed system passwords without telling anyone and broke about 7 different and very important services. Including a firewall rule change that denied all email connections in and out of the College.    

That was a fun morning on the helpdesk, the phone never did stop ringing...     

3 month's later it's midterm exam week and as the evening progresses, the connections are dropping off one by one, not good, not good!   

I run over to the datacenter and inform them.   
$Systems- No it's not, what do you know kid?    
$Me \*internally* Apparently more than you...    
$Me \*externally* Watch, see my phone not getting an address?   
The network/DHCP is dying!      
$Systems- Bugger off!  

You guessed it, the entire network floundered for the rest of the weekend.      

A New CIO:  
 His arrival is announced in a very formal and professional way, like an esteemed scholar would write a sonnet at sunset. I email him with the eloquence of a Renaissance poet describing how there is more downtime than uptime and DHCP must be fixed to not ever crash under extremely high demand every fall/spring. He acknowledges it and says it will be prioritized accordingly.       

For a while, things did get alot better, then there was some political power struggle which drove off a good part of the IT team and that means all of the good people with great ideas left...     
  
Suddenly, a new NAC arrives without warning or surveying the students on what they want out of an awesome network. Bradford was unleashed and stomped out all hope of having a reliable, fast, or efficient network access.    

Me \*thinking* - You know what, since all web requests are redirected the portal, let me change my DNS to 8.8.8.8, BOOM! Bypassed!   
Next semester, all DNS requests are now forwarded internally through Bradford, you're welcome said the IT guys. ;)    

Well kids, it was fun while it lasted.   
  
Bradford was notorious to forget previously registered staff computers, three computers a week was the average where a professor would submit a request that they're not getting email/internet anymore.Can IT reach the computer remotely? Nope! What's the IP? Bradford Isolation network, figures \*rolls eyes*   

We had to submit port and computer exemptions all the time just to get computers imaged, staff online, and new systems deployed, it was a huge waste of time and $DesktopSupport had to bug $Networking quite frequently to speed up the process.    
 
They moved Bradford to wired only because of how much of a pain wireless was for the students, I would say that there was a 25% failure rate to get people online for the wifi. After $Net moved to a $HoneyComb PPSK, it dropped/dripped the failure rate down to 10% but for some reason, $ITsec did not believe in 802.1X/Radius even after multiple professional colleagues recommended it.   
  
Once again, the PPSK method was not presented or held an open forum for wifi modernization, they just announced, hey we're doing a thing, call the helpdesk if it breaks, may the odds be ever in your favor. During this time, they finally NAT'ed the wifi network, it only took asking them 4000 times and 15 years of prep time /s.    
  
Last in the whirlwind take, internet failures on the WAN side happened multiple times, and there was one outage that was $DeathStarISP's fault and was never disclosed what happened, because when you kill cellular + wired service for a large portion of the state, there's going to be a rather large and annoyed set of students needing to finish exams.    
  
Randomly one fine spring afternoon, the internet just stopped, and it wasn't DNS or DHCP like before. $RandomProf - Well, there goes the online instructional tools, powerpoint time!  
We get an announcement later saying there was digging happening in a nearby city, combined with the SCP compliant fiber and assorted heavy construction that goes with the project, they predictably they cut the only connection serving the school.  

Did they relocate the fiber away from the construction area?   
No....    

Did it get cut more than once?   
Yep! 4 times during especially busy parts of the semesters.  
  
Did they learn their lesson and get a second connection?    
Eventually...    

Throughout all of it, I learned what not to do, I discovered some new things, aced senior level Networking without ever having to study, and sharpened my tech support skills tenfold while repairing friend and company computers/figuring out the kludgy network design/asking why on earth would you do it this way?​  ",False,58,17,techtornado,talesfromtechsupport

#Intro

Some time ago at a previous assignment I was in a team of 10 people supporting 1st line IT needs of a user base of 2500 users in a colossal international company $BlackSugaryLiquid. Our team was efficient and structured and led by a competent young lady $MissBoss. We would handle all sorts of office and production related IT problems and would resolve quite a lot of them ourselves. Some of our tickets we would have to escalate to back line teams, who would in turn kick it back to us when they had a solution. $BlackSugaryLiquid, while having lots of sites in different countries, had the habit of outsourcing key IT components to the South of the Himalayas ($HCL henceforth) and other low wages countries. This was met with much frustration of everyone within IT and outside of IT, since you receive the quality for which you pay.

I write this from memory so details I no longer remember could be left out

#Once more, into the breach
The first week following the $Crypto nuke it was the talk of the day; every day. Many emails came and went, (irrelevant) contact information was exchanged and an effort was made by $Bigbosses to enlighten users on the dangers of bizarre emails in the form of an upcoming surprise test. This test would later prove to be an obvious fake email along the lines of “CLICK ME AND YOU WILL GET MONEY”. Users who would click the link would get written down, while the ones who reported this to the appropriate authorities would get a shiny worthless certificate in outstanding IT security made in MS paint according to a colleague.

Among all of this buzz there was still a sore spot that had not been addressed: $ITSecurity. We had not heard from them since the initial disaster and we assumed they had their leashes pulled tight; even $MissBoss did not have any news regarding the follow up of $ITsecurity and what they would do to prevent total meltdowns in the future.

The answer came a mere 2 weeks later after the first disaster. In the $Finance department yet again a malicious email was received and converted into a ticket by $Tool. Some unlucky sucker from $Finance opened the ticket including its attachment and all hell broke loose once again. From his PC it hopped through the shared network drive onto the server and began its onslaught once again. The only thing that stood between $Crypto2 and its end goal of completion was the sheer amount of data itself. If you throw enough bodies at something it will take some time.

When we received the phone call that informed us of the news we were flabbergasted. Dumbfounded. Bamboozled. Not only had $Tool not been subjugated to severe scrutiny by $ITsecurity, disaster 2 had occurred exactly the same way as disaster 1. An email to $ITsecurity was send (yes, still no phone number) and while we were waiting in anxiousness loads of verbal insults and cries of lamentation were heard around the office. A high priority ticket was raised once more and $MissBoss was escalating things, desperately trying to get things moving. 

Luckily for the entire company $BigBoss had a direct phone number this time for $ITsecurity somewhere written down on a post it and after a full hour after our first email they responded. It still took them 2 more hours to actually DO something as they were waiting for approval to get the server detached from the network to begin their cleaning. After a total of 4 hours after the initial phone call the server was completely detached and wiped. Steps were taken to perform a restoration from backup. The following part will be forever etched in my memory when it was relayed by $Missboss to us. She was in the emergency conference call regarding all this and when it came to the part to restore the backups the conversation proceeded like this:

&gt;$Biggerboss: Alright, the disaster seems to be diverted. We can proceed with the restoration, you have my approval.
&gt;

&gt;$ITsecurity: …

&gt;$Biggerboss: Well?

&gt;$ITsecurity: It would seem that after disaster 1 all types of backups were disabled and not been reinitiated afterwards. As of now the most recent backup we have is from 2 weeks ago from before disaster 1.

Note2: keep in mind that this encompassed the entirety of all the financial data + other important documents of all the European sites.
After this statement a full minute of silence was maintained over the conference call. All involved parties were slowly realizing the extent of having no backups for 2 weeks. A pandemonium rose up as everyone started shouting at once trying to get the upper hand. Nothing constructive was blurted and none of the words that actually could be understood were rated PG 13. 

Being the alpha male $Biggerboss let himself be known throughout the chaos: he demanded silence and asked in a civil manner and yet with barely unrestrained anger:

&gt;$Biggerboss: Can you inform us as to why the backups were not switched back on after disaster 1?

876,Unlimited Power!,"**[Timeline](https://redd.it/6v3az8) of my other stories separated by company.**

&amp;nbsp;

*** 

&amp;nbsp;

It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything. I’ve been caught up with both work, time with my daughter, and sheer laziness. I’m going to try to get back into the grove of posting something at least twice a month. Especially when I have tons of tales from my military days, my current job, and other previous positions.

As some of you may recall, I currently work for a company that deals with back office software. We’ll call them **$BOCompany**. I am one of two individuals who install our hardware and software for our back office system while the customer is in their implementation phase. Our technical support team takes over most technical issues after the implementation phase has ended.

One of our technical support representatives is a bit…special to say the least. He tends to ask multiple people the same question as well as not listen at the same time. He also told the entire team that his mom used to call him Boo Boo, so we shall call him **$BooBoo**. $BooBoo has gotten somewhat better at listening recently, but this store takes place about three months ago. He was click happy back then, and still is.

We use a proprietary in-house built piece of hardware to communicate to our server. These are installed at the customers’ locations to retrieve store information and what-not. Our devices communicate to our servers using a VPN. So like all things, it needs active internet connectivity. The VPN does like to go down randomly on these devices. Sometimes it’s due to the customer’s internet, power loss, or our device just being stupid because it is pretty cheap.

So, a customer (**$Cust**) calls in because our website showed him that his VPN was down, thus his register information was not being reported. $BooBoo got the call. $BooBoo was excited because this was his first easy call of the morning. I overheard the entire call as I was ~~looking over my schedule and backlog of implementation tickets~~ browsing Reddit before my first appointment of the day. $BooBoo eventually came to me for assistance as he could not get the device online at all.

&gt;**$BooBoo**: Hey $Me, I need help with this VPN issue.  
&gt;**$Me**: Did you reboot it?  
&gt;**$BooBoo**: Yeah, and that didn’t work.  
&gt;**$Me**: Did you swap the Ethernet cables with known good cables?  
&gt;**$BooBoo**: Yes. Didn’t work either.  
&gt;**$Me**: Did you try a different outlet?  
&gt;**$BooBoo**: Yes. Nothing.  
&gt;**$Me**: Well, I have an appointment in 10 minutes. Make a ticket and I’ll look at it later.

At this point in time, $BooBoo was on the phone with the customer for about an hour. I heard him try to get the customer to reboot our device several more times. I messaged him on Skype for Business more than once to get him to just open a ticket and get them off the phone until I could call them, but $BooBoo wasn’t having it. He wanted to be the hero. Good for him, right? Not when there’s only three technical support personnel on the queue with calls coming in like crazy.

So anyway, he eventually gets the customer off the phone and makes the ticket. I finish up my appointment and check out his ticket. He actually put in a detailed description of everything he allegedly did. This was a first, but I digress. I decided it was time to call the customer.

&gt;**$Me**: Hey $Cust, this is $Me from $BOCompany. I understand you have a VPN issue, and I know you worked with $BooBoo earlier, but I wanted to knock out some simple troubleshooting to ensure we covered everything before replacing that device.  
&gt;**$Cust**: Okay, but we already rebooted it, swapped cables, and everything.  

I had $Cust trace all of the Ethernet cables and power cable from our device to make sure that it is properly plugged into everything it needed to be. And then I heard this dime:

&gt;**$Cust**: It has no lights on it. Should there be lights? I told the last guy I talked to that it has no lights. Not even on the “PWR” light.  
&gt;**$Me**: …  
&gt;**$Me**: Did your guy’s power go out? Do you currently have power?  
&gt;**$Cust**: We lost power the other day, but we do have power now.  

After a magical face shaped imprint appeared on my desk, I unmuted my phone and had the customer find a working power outlet using their phone charger. Once an outlet was found, we moved our device to that outlet and our device magically started working again. I also advised them to get an electrician to check and/or fix the wiring.

&gt;**$Me**: Hey, $BooBoo.  
&gt;**$BooBoo**: Huh?  
&gt;**$Me**: Did you check to see if our box was getting power?  
&gt;**$BooBoo**: Yeah.  
&gt;**$Me**: Are you sure?  
&gt;**$BooBoo**: Yeah… Why?  
&gt;**$Me**: Because the box wasn’t even powered on. We moved it to a new outlet and it works.  
&gt;**$BooBoo**: I swear we tried that!  
&gt;**$Me**: Obviously not. Just admit you missed a step, learn from it, and move on.

Needless to say, $BooBoo has not lived this down. Good thing he has a sense of humor.

Back then the kind of issues that scared me the most were the ""I cannot connect to wireless"". Most of the times they were in the airport so no chance to try to restart router or anything like that, also could not take remote control to troubleshoot myself.
The first question that I always asked was if they could see any wireless connection. Since his answer was no I thought to myself they must have turned off wireless from the laptop. 
After trying to explain to him that he needs to press Fn and the F key that had the wireless icon I  ask him for the laptop model and search on google to see which key it was. Let's say it was F8 . So I start to explain. 
- On your keyboard on the left bottom corner, next to Ctrl you have the Fn key, press that and the F8 
- Let me look.
After a couple of minutes of silence I ask him:
- Did you press it?
His answer almost made me want to hit my head on the desk.
-Where exactly in Control Panel did you say it was?
I have to say that I have never mentioned Control Panel and till that day I had no idea that when you tell someone to press keys on his keyboard there will be people that will not know what that is. I keep my calm and explain again

881,The Power of a Pavilion,"As I’ve stated in the past, I’m not technically tech support. However, due to the number of electronics outside of warranty in use at my house on a daily basis, I’ve become pseudo-IT, as I can typically understand and diagnose the issue.


This was not the case today.


At first, it was, as the issue to pass by my “work table”, which essentially amounts to a coffee table drug into a corner, was a case of a stuck spacebar on my younger $Sister’s laptop. Pretty simple, I asked her about it and she said she’d poured soda on it some months ago and didn’t tell anyone, because it still worked. I took it downstairs, and not seeing any easy way to get at the key caps (which became the near-fatal bit of inattention for the laptop), I opened the underside. I bored my way through the case and internals, eventually getting even the main board out. I looked for somewhere safe, as the main board had traces and chips on the bottom and I didn’t want to break it, and eventually decided on the top of $Elder’s white coat. 


$Elder works as a pharmacy technician, but had come home and gone to the store again, which was why his coat was balled on my table. I eventually realized that my efforts to get at the keyboard via the underside were in vain, as there was no disconnecting the middle frame from the board that I could see. Even Google pulled up nothing, which is when you know you’re in uncharted territory. I reassembled the system.


No boot. 5 second light on the power button. A google search for that told me it was the main board. 


I tried undoing and redoing every single ribbon cable, and nothing. Tried cleaning the area near the CPU to see if there was residual thermal paste. There was, but it wasn’t the source of my issue, and in the process I got some liquid canned air on the board because I was holding it sideways, and had to wait for it to dry. Then I tried booting it again. No luck.


I set it aside, as at this point I’d been staring at the internals of this laptop for nearly two hours, and was thoroughly stumped. That’s when $Elder walks through the door.


$Elder doesn’t know the first thing about main boards and the components on them, doesn’t know the difference between a resistor or a transistor, and you could probably convince him there was such a thing as a “consister” under there. He has, however, a good understanding of other mechanics - need a car rebuilt from the ground up? With a little help, $Elder can do it. Leaky sink? $Elder knows how to fix that too. 


The other thing he’s good at is bullshitting his way to the problem. I told him what I’d tried, and his response made me feel really stupid.


&gt;$Elder: Did you check the underside of the board?


&gt;$Me: No.


&gt;$Elder: Give me a minute.


With this, he proceeds to, with some guidance to screws, unfasten the main board, and flip it over.


&gt;$Elder: Well, there’s your problem. See this? *points at a glob on the board* There’s soda and lint here.


With this, we proceed to clean the board, with a combination of Q-Tips and isopropyl alcohol (logic being “if it’s good enough for CPU thermal paste, it’s good enough for any PCB”). Plug everything back in, and… no boot.


My brother pulls two plugs, which he thought were both the battery (one was the speaker), and, voila. 


&gt;$Me: WE HAVE WINDOWS! ……… Kinda. Oh no, just slow, we’re good.


And… UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME.


So, a USB reinstall of Windows later, and we’re on the desktop. Now to try and get everything plugged in underneath, take it upstairs, and gloat, right? No, of course not. Plug the two connectors back in, and nothing. 5 second blink code. 


So, what do we do? We unplug the “battery”, and it’s my turn to notice something.


&gt;$Me: Um, so, why are you unplugging the speakers and the battery?


&gt;$Elder: What do you mean? That’s just the battery, right?


&gt;$Me: No. No that isn’t. Plug this *pointing at battery cable* back in. Leave this *pointing at speaker cable* out.


It booted just fine. So, the issue was, at least in part, when I first tried to take apart the system. The speaker cable is located in an odd spot I couldn’t quite get to, so I tried a pair of needlenose pliers. I gave up on that after it slipped, and apparently I did some damage to the connection between the speakers in the PC and the motherboard. The lint-covered soda probably didn’t help, but at the end of the day, it was partially my fault.

883,Phantom of the Fax Machine,"Summertime has come and with me being out of classes, this is usually the time all technology in the house decides to break down solely to eat up my precious break time. Where I live is a hot city that never sleeps and so I tend to be up late. My evenings are usually spent running battlegrounds with my brother and doing lines of Vaseline to stop the incessant nosebleeds that come with hot and dry weather.

Now my grandmother is a nurse. And as a nurse, the fax machine/printer combo is an essential piece of machinery despite being outdated by roughly nine geological epochs.
My grandmother is trying to send a fax to the hospital she works at. It was fairly important that it was sent in a timely fashion. However, today, it's just not working.

$Me: Yours truly

$Gma: My grandmother, nurse of 40 years 

$Gpa: My grandfather, knows nothing about tech but tends to blame everything that goes wrong with the computer on me and my brother.

$Bro: My little brother

After several failed attempts to illicit a response from the printer, my grandmother charters me to fix the problem. 

&gt;$Gma - $Nightmare-chan, the fax doesn't want to go through

&gt;$Me - Alright, I'll look at it.

I run though all my basic steps, is it on, is it connected, all that. I turn it off and on again. I even unplug it and plug it back in for good measure. The cables are secure and the printer reports that it's connected to the computer. But any attempt to send a fax gets precisely zero response, not a beep, not an error message, just the printer UI staring almost aggressively at me. Any number entered in the software gets the same silent treatment. 

As I'm walking out to make sure the phone line is still connected (our landline is connected through our modem), $Gpa comes in. 

&gt;$Gpa - How is it going?

&gt;$Me - I'm still trying to fix it. I'll tell you when I've got it working.

&gt;$Gpa - I think it's all those games $Bro installs on that computer. It messes everything up.

I don't bother with that because I've tried to convince him that's not how anything works and it's an lesson in futility. I manage to redirect him outside so I can work in peace. The phone line is connected, as usual, so I'm back to square one. I sit and stare at the printer. The UI screen stares back, as though daring me to try again just to watch me fail. 

My grandmother needs to send that fax before the hospital closes and that's already closer than I'd like. The fax machine seems to know this as the clock on the interface mocks me with the time. Right then, I also notice the number on the chassis does not match up with the printer the fax software was trying to send the request to. 

My grandparents had a previous printer that differed in model number by only one digit, and my grandmother had accidentally selected a fax machine that wasn't there anymore. 

I rectified the error and the fax finally goes through. My grandmother is elated, and I wrote a post-it note to remind myself to remove the non-existent printer from the list sometime in the near future.

It's a Monday morning and I'm woken by a cat meowing in my face. This almost always means my alarm hasn't gone off and I'm already running late. I race out of bed, get ready and leave just a few minutes later than I normally would. 



I arrive at work and the first thing I notice is my coworkers car isn't there, looks like I'm on my own today. I open the door and before I even get to my office - before I've even taken a step into the building, I'm greeted by two staff members telling me the Wi-Fi is down. 



Now I've been working here for a while now but I'm still new-ish. I've never had to deal with this kind of issue by myself before. Not only that but my absent coworker is the one who handles the severs and would normally handle this kind of issue. 



I dump my stuff in my office and head over to the server room. As soon as I open the door I can hear a high pitched whirring. Pretty quickly I work out which switch has the issue, the big orange fault light confirms this and I figure the first thing I have to try is turning it off and on again. 



I turn it off and that orange light stops staring at me. I wait a few seconds and turn it back on.


Almost straight away the whirring is back and the fault light is flashing that bright orange. 



My first thought is that I just didn't leave it off for long enough. I do it again and make sure to wait plenty of time before I turn it back on but the moment I turn do I find the orange light and the whirring have colluded to continue to mocking me. 



I decide its time to call in the big guns, I give my coworker a call but he doesn't pick up. I email him instead and with no internet I head back to the server room just in case something jumps out at me.



""What's the harm in trying one more time."" I say to myself out loud. I stare down that orange light before shutting my eyes and turn it off one more time. 



I turn it back on, I can't hear the whirring but I'm still afraid to open my eyes and look. I sneak a peak and there's no light!! I run to the nearest computer to double check and lucky me, I see that pretty rainbow google logo!

I get her to open up file explorer and navigate to the SD card. Now she starts randomly opening folders to try and find the pictures. She's not listening to what folders I'm telling her to open, and now she's 5 directories deep and totally lost. I tell her to go pack to the DCIM folder. ""How do I go back?"" she asks me. I tell her to click the back button. Apparently in her 20+ years of using a computer she has never used a back button in the file explorer. Now we have to close out and start all over again.

Me = Me

Prof = Professor for one of our schools that I don't usually interact with

DM = My manager, someone who has been here many years and has a ton of knowledge. Also into gaming so DM is an appropriate name.

The story starts off in the afternoon of a relatively quiet day, when Prof come to the technology window looking for help. 

&gt;Prof: I have a problem with my laptop. About two weeks ago, randomly when I use the delete key my screen goes black and when the computer turns back on I have to log in again.

&gt;Me: okay, let me take a look at it and see if I can find anything wrong.

I take the computer to the back bench, run the built it diagnostic from the company with no errors and run a memory test with no reported issues. I can't find anything wrong, but since the screen is going black I decide to update the video driver and while I am at it the bios.

&gt;Me calling Prof: Okay, I can't seem to find anything wrong. I have updated a couple things and my entire time trying to replicate the issue has not been successful. I am hoping that the issue has been resolved.

Prof then came got her laptop and I moved on to the next ticket in my queue. 30 minutes later I get a call that the issue happened again. I ask prof to drop of the laptop for a full day of testing.

The next day I run a full gamut of tests trying to replicate the error with absolutely no luck. I start thinking it is an issue with the function keys but that doesn't produce the same error. Finally I call up prof and let me know I can't find anything wrong.

After she collects her laptop I start talking to boss, trying to think of what else could be the issue.

&gt;Me: DM, I ran the full gamut of tests and I could not replicate her issue, but I would be willing to bet she will be back again. Do you have any thoughts on what could be causing the screen to go black and then back to the login screen randomly.

&gt;DM: Other than the things you already tested for, my thought would be maybe water damage is shorting a key, although it should have been seen during the testing. The other thought is maybe something is messing with the laptop lid sensor.

At this moment it was like lightening struck my brain. I remembered two things, 1) the professor had a bunch of bracelets on and 2) I remembered u/techdoggo's story [The Bad Touch](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6ssyn1/the_bad_touch/)

Thankfully, I have a spare machine of her model to test with so with the magnetic clasp on my watch I test the theory. Using my watch on my right wrist and hitting the right corner of the laptop, the screen goes black and comes back with a log in screen. 

I quickly call up the prof, tell her I know thats going on, and ask if I can come to her office.

&gt;Me: So I know what is going on but first let me ask, are any of those bracelets new and do any of them have a magnetic clasp to hold them together.

&gt;Prof looked at me very puzzed but replied: Yes this one right here (pointing to the one on her right wrist). You don't think that's the issue do you.

&gt;Me Yes, yes I do. May I see it and test it to make sure.

I then run the bracelet over the sensor and it shuts the screen off. The reason I couldn't replicate the issue was I have nothing on my right arm with a magnet and when ever prof came to the window she was hunting and pecking to make sure she was doing everything correctly. 

She gladly accepted this as what was going on and told me she would not be wearing that bracelet around computers ever again.

**$Me** : ...llo? Why?

**$D** *still panicking* : Nothing's working! They lost their whole Fire systems and nothing works! We need you to fix that everyone over there is freaking out!

**$Me:** Okay... But I am 5 minutes from [Third Location] it would be pointless to do that!

**$D** *whispering to $CO-Worker about what $ME just said*

**$D** : Okay in this case do the third call then go over there as fast as you can!

Obviously $Me completed his third call and finally reached the imposing 6 blocks multi-story building which he knows very well how old the system is and how complicated the networked fire system is.

$Me is greeted by $SEC with her usual attitude and bland tone.

**$Me** *trying to make $SEC downside smile for an upside smile* : Hey $Sec! How are you?

**$SEC** : please sign the logbook while I call $BT.

**$ME** *while writting the required information in said logbook* : So! What's wrong with the system?

**$SEC** : everything! Since this morning I cannot do anything and it is driving me nuts because it keeps beeping non-stop. Come inside and wait for $BT

**$ME** : No prob'! Mind if I start looking at it?

**$SEC** : I am telling you, nothing's working!

$ME drop his backpack filled of tool and start loggin on the Digital Graphic User Interface of said Fire Alarm System. Our hero notice that the mouse is working but not the keyboard. He decided to kneel infront the god of technology and pull out the computer. As he pull it out he notice a small broken piece. 

Following his instinct, $ME follow the keyboard cable and find out it is plugged in a [USB 4Port splitter](http://www.sparkdesignllc.com/img/41.jpg) but it is in pieces. $Me do his best to fix the cover and make sure everything plugged in is working. Magically, the keyboard is now responding. Our trusty technician then finally log into the computer and start to notice that only the computer does not answer to any Nodes (7 nodes if you include said computer) and when he means any he means that it does not even communicate with itself...

$Me then decide to do what every tech does here. Press Start Menu (because it still runs with Windows XP), Power Menu, Restart. After a few minutes, the Node #7 reboot log in the network, start talking to every other nodes.

So that's it. #Me rebooted the computer and waited for half an hour trying to get $D sending the WO but alas it wasn't ready yet, meanwhile she had been told that our protagonist was waiting from her to close the call as it is fixed. 

Her reaction? (psst, read the title) then $CO-Worker asked how it had been resolved so quick... By doing Step #1 of Troubleshooting: ""Did you turn it off and on?""

903,Try the other monitor!,"LTL FTP and all that. So sorry for any poor formatting.


$me = the one and only
$user = user


I support an office of around 80 people, just me and the network admin, things are pretty normal around here and I don't get very many interesting stories to share but I did have something peculiar happen this morning.


This morning $user walked up to my desk to inform me that his computer has blue screened 3 times in the last couple hours and that this has happened before but it would usually happen once and then be fine. So I walk over to his desk with him, he has dual monitors (important). When we arrive he shows me the action he performs in excel to trigger the error. Lo and behold the dreaded BSOD shows up on his right monitor with the error SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION. Although the odd part wasn't the BSOD but the fact that his left monitor (the one he had excel on) was still displaying excel and was frozen. So I quickly walk back to my desk to google the error as any good tech would and find some common causes, one being something to do with a graphics driver. I then remember that he has been using a USB 2.0 to DVI adapter for his left monitor. So, I walk back to his desk, grabbing a DisplayPort to DVI adapter on my way. When I arrived our exchange went something like:


&gt;$me: Okay, I am going to ask something really weird, before I do anything can you try doing exactly what you did before but do it on the right monitor.  


&gt;$user: Okay?.....  

$user performs the task and the computer does not blue screen.  

&gt;$me: aha! Now try moving excel to the other monitor.  

$user moves excel to the other monitor and the computer instantly blue screens again. I then swap out the display adapter and throw out the old one.


TLDR: Excel causes computer to BSOD due to an old USB 2.0 to DVI adapter.

904,"Family photos, freakout and fix","Well then, it all starts back in last year. I've been helping my father for a while to set up his new laptop, which is of a crappier Lenovo model because I'm the dedicated IT-tech-savvy master of our household. 


I had just set up his PC and he managed to set up his local windows account before I transferred a bunch of stuff, mainly family photos from 2008 through 2016 with the use of a thumb drive.


A few weeks pass and he really, really messed something up. I don't know what he did, but something fucked over his profile in such a way where I had to make a new one. So I just did it. It never crossed my mind that all those family photos was there before my father pointed it out. I freak out a little bit now, because I let it slip over my head.


I quickly download recuva and try to pull a lucky shot by trying to recover them onto an external HDD with no luck. 


The anxiety is growing on me now, and I tell him I'll fix it and get them back. After hours of googling, browsing through tech support subreddits and considering just shushing it away the anxiety just snaps and I start shaking, because it simply *can't afford to loose these photos.*


But then a lightbulb lights up in my head. The thumb drive. *The damn thumb drive.* I hadn't used it since I copied over those files. I rush into my room and start looking for it. Not on my desk. Not in my drawer. The I realised, it's in my backpack. I almost tear it open, and uses recuva to grab them off it. 


It worked. 


Before people tell me **""BACKUP YOU FUCKING IDIOT""**, I have backups now, on the thumb drive, on my laptop, on his and on Drive. It's safe now.

905,A Tale of Two $Reds,"EDIT: Holy smokes, Reddit Gold! Thank you kind fellow Redditor!

Working in higher ed, we had some generous benefits, including considerable yearly vacation. So much that with having to work Christmas shutdown usually (IT never sleeps), the entire IT department often lost days because we never used all our vacation.

All of us except $Red, of course. $Red would bitch, constantly and loudly, about work during the holiday shutdown. Every.Single.Time. He didn't seem to get that IT was a ""service"" to the college and that occasionally we had to work when other people didn't.  But the reason $Red never lost any days was because he somehow managed to blow every lick of vacation, sick time or bereavement leave he had. And not just 2 days here, 4 days there. No, no, $Red would take two solid weeks at a crack in the middle of a semester. At tremendously inconvenient times. 

The whole college had a bright line ""no time off during student move-in week"" rule. The week the freshmen showed up, and then all the upperclass students came back, it was ""all hands on deck"" for 7-10 days straight. We even brought on some hired guns for helpdesk support to lighten the load and spread out the support hours each day to be sure we got everybody connected, etc. We even kept a couple of these guys on for a few weeks thereafter until the support load lessened.

Each year the college put out the administrative calendar for the following year around the beginning of the fall semester, including holidays, vacation blackout dates, etc. And every year, $Red would try to put in for some vacation during the fall or spring student move-ins, be told ""No, vacation blackout"" and he'd rant and rave for weeks afterward about the injustice of it all. It was almost comical if it hadn't been annoying as hell after the first time, listening to a mid-50s adult male whine like an entitled bitch about how he's so put upon, life and $ITVP are so unfair, etc. Whatever dude. Your kid is getting tuition-free college at a pretty high-end school, you're getting 6+ weeks of vacation a year, you're paid 25% more than anybody else in the department. Quit bitching.

When $Red would take his mid-semester vacations, it was pretty much impossible for us to go 2 weeks at a clip without someone sitting in the NOC handling network problems. Especially the way $Red had the network so lashed up.  So $ITVP would call a staffing agency we used to send us a network administrator ""stand-in"" for $Red. Generally, it worked out pretty good, because the stand-in would discover all the things $Red was ignoring or hadn't bothered to do, they'd put together a list of things that really should be fixed over the long term, and a  couple times a year $ITVP got an independent list of ""things that need to be done."" That didn't come from $Red. (that $Red complained about)

My second summer was when we replaced all the switches and implemented the Network Access Control system, and this coming fall's move-in was going to be our first ""big"" experience with it. The fly in the ointment, however, was that $Red's oldest daughter was headed off to her first year of college, too. Her school in the next state had the same campus move-in dates as we did, and there was, in $Red's words, ""No way my kid is going to college and I'm not taking here there.""  So $Red wheedled and finagled with $ITVP to take **three** days off during what was our busiest week of the year. *Nobody* got time off during move-in unless it was a death in the family, and here's $Red telling anybody who will listen that he's getting three days off while everybody has to work. The *entire* IT department was on the warpath after that. 

There's always something that $Red had to do during move-in weekends: fixing user accounts, rebuilding student drives, email setups, dorm switches, whatever. And this fall we have the complication of the brand-new NAC setup and a new way of registering, scanning and enabling student computers on the network. Its supposed to be *easier* and more streamlined for students to register and remediate their own computers so they should only have to see us when there is a problem.  We shouldn't have to touch every single student computer by hand. But we (the $UserSupport and $Network team) haven't really seen the NAC in full-on action with hundreds of students trying to login, follow instructions, etc. It was either going to be awesome or a complete shit show. I wasn't going to build my support assumptions this first time around on a smooth ride and get caught behind the eight ball. 

Having $Red gone, with a brand-new NAC and physical network, when the tidal wave of freshmen hit was a major non-starter, and I told $ITVP that. But she'd already given $Red the go-ahead. 

However, she agreed to two things: 

First, $Walt, the expert who had just worked us thru the entire implementation, and arguably knew the NAC better than $Red did, would stay on through the first two weeks of school. He'd help with any problems, additional support staff training, etc. $Walt was actually excited so see the whole thing in action having just worked for 5+ months with us on the project. $Walt was a little nerdy and said he seldom got to see the ""fruits of his labor in action.""  $Walt was a pretty crackerjack network admin, so I felt pretty good that the physical network would be in good hands with $Red gone.

Second, $ITVP had the staffing agency send us the stand-in for $Red's mid-semester vacation a little early. He could get familiar with our network and the NAC with $Red and $Walt before $Red took his kid to college and working with $Walt. Then the stand-in would spend a few weeks doing user support with my team, and go back to network administration during $Red's scheduled vacation. It was good for continuity, it was good for $Red, it was good for my support folks, and of course the staffing people weren't going to complain about the billable hours.

Two days before freshman move-in, $Red's stand-in showed up. $ITVP and I briefed the stand-in and his $AccountManager the first day, giving him a thumbnail sketch of the department, the expectations and $ITVP's vision. Immediately, I realized that this guy was was really *everything* $Red wasn't: smart, engaging, willing to communicate, willing to go the extra mile, skilled at the job, could think outside the box, had a depth of knowledge beyond Google, knew and admitted what he didn't know, etc. And he was friendly. 

Due to that, lets call him $NotRed. 

I filled $NotRed in on what I thought he was going to run into as traps and pitfalls while we walked from $ITVP's office to the NOC. $Red left the day before freshman move-in, telling me that he thought it was going to be a complete shit show because my support team wasn't ""up to the job."" Hey, wow, thanks $Red for that awesome assessment of my guys.  

Oddly, the entire freshman move-in went fairly smoothly: $NotRed &amp; $Walt handled any odd NAC things that came up, my support team with the temps came up to speed on most of the idiosyncrasies of the NAC quickly, and were able to get get things moving along in a matter of hours instead of days. By the end of the Day 2 we had more than 90% of the freshman laptops checked in, remediated and on the network. There's always those systems students bring that don't meet the published specs (""Hey, wow, Win98. Awesome."") or require extra work (""No anti-virus or anti-spyware, never been updated, and 212 viruses. SCORE!""). But because the NAC was making the students do most of the work like updates and AV scanning as part of the registration process, my support team only had to deal with the systems that wouldn't pass for whatever reason. The upperclass students were actually *more* troublesome since the NAC was ""not the way they'd always done it,"" their systems were more likely to be in even worse shape than the freshmen because they were older, and they basically ignored most of the user messaging we'd put together on the subject.

(Actual conversation overheard in the Help Desk one afternoon)
&gt;$Student: ""What do you mean, Windows 95 isn't going to work? My uncle gave me this laptop when I started here 3 years ago! It its a top of the line computer!""

&gt;$SupportTech: ""Yeah, in 1997. This is 2004!""

But even then, at least 90% of the upperclass computers were on the network within three days of their arrival, so generally not bad. $Walt went on his merry way a few days earlier than planned since things were operating smoothly, we had support from the NAC vendor, and both $Red and $NotRed had a good handle on the process. $NotRed finished out the move-in week with my user support team and we were making good headway in killing off any outstanding tickets leftover from move-in. At the same time, $NotRed did something $Red *never* did: He actually used the Help Desk ticket system and started mining thru old open tickets to either fix the problem or close the ticket as no longer needed. Our open ticket number dropped precipitously, especially all the tickets sitting in the ""network"" queue that were beneath $Red's contempt. Printers, PCs, wireless issues, wiring issues, all of it, $NotRed didn't care: He was here, he wanted to work, so let him find and fix things. He traipsed all over campus addressing student, staff &amp; faculty issues, closing tickets and getting good reviews from the user community.  

About 5 weeks after freshman move in, $Red left for his 2+ week vacation. As planned, $NotRed went from doing mostly end-user support in the help desk to the chair in $Red's office in the NOC. But he continued to close tickets. He found problems in the NOC, documented the issue and fixed it. He rewired a switch closet in a dorm. He even continued to ""go walk about"" to find and fix *any* open help desk tickets, even end-user stuff. The user community had gotten used to seeing $NotRed's face all around the campus and the feedback was positive.

Middle of $Red's first vacation week, I was in $ITVP's office discussing a faculty issue when out of the blue she asked ""Do you think we should hire $NotRed?""

&gt;$Me: ""Do you mean to work with $Red? That might be troublesome.""

&gt;$ITVP: ""No, I mean *instead* of $Red.""

&gt;$Me: (shocked) ""Uhh, is this even a possibility?""

&gt;$ITVP: ""Look, I've been thinking about this a long time, but $NotRed made me realize that $Red just sucks.""

Never mind that I'd been telling $ITVP for a year that $Red was the reason our shit didn't work right and that we had so much downtime.  Guess she needed some processing time on that info.

&gt;$Me: ""Can we even get $NotRed? How much would that cost?""

&gt;$ITVP: ""I can hire him direct, have to pay a premium to the staffing agency for that, and still not be at $Red's salary. Do you think $NotRed would want to do that?""

&gt;$Me: (having discussed with $NotRed his interest in working for us some weeks before) ""Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.""

&gt;$ITVP: ""Ok... when $Red gets back from vacation, I'm going to let him go.""

$ITVP waved her hand and changed the subject. Unfortunately for us, much like all her other ""good ideas"" she failed to follow through with this idea. It was all just a random thought that popped into her head and then went away just like that, never to be heard from again. Typical $ITVP.

A little over a week later, $Red came back from vacation to find a laundry list of things that $NotRed had fixed, improved, changed and documented on his desk. $NotRed stayed a day or two more to do any handover and then left for another assignment with the staffing agency. We were sad to see $NotRed go, and held a little 'going away party' in the Help Desk for him that didn't include $Red, because he was happy to see $NotRed go. $NotRed was a threat to his existence. 

At our next departmental meetings, $Red was more direct:

&gt;$Red: ""$NotRed exceeded his authority. He wasn't just holding down the fort like I told him to do.  Its going to take me six months to go thru and find all the shit he changed!""

&gt;$Me: ""You mean all the stuff he documented and fixed??""

&gt;$Red: ""There's no way he did that much while I was gone!""

&gt;$Me: ""No, he did a lot more. Thats just the network stuff."" 

&gt;$Red: ""He changed stuff I would never change!""

(I watched the faces of my team after $Red made that last pronouncement. I though my $HelpDeskLead was going to say something like ""Yeah, and thats the reason the network is running better"", but thankfully he held his tongue)

The proof was in the pudding regarding $NotRed when I was in the admin building about a week or two after $NotRed left. One of the departmental admins asked me where $NotRed was.

&gt;$Me: ""Oh, his last day was almost 2 weeks ago.""

&gt;$Admin: ""What? You mean he's already quit?""

&gt;$Me: ""No, $NotRed was a temp we had in from $StaffingAgency, like we do for freshman move-in. He was with us a little longer than normal because he was also filling in for $Red's vacation.""

&gt;$Admin: ""No way! I thought he was a full time employee.""

&gt;$Me: ""What made you think that?""

&gt;$Admin: ""Well, I mean, he was here early in the morning and late in the afternoon every day, and he actually took ownership of some of the problems we were experiencing, asked us about them, and he actually fixed them.  Which was completely not my experience with $Red.""

&gt;$Me: ""Make sure you tell your boss that. And make sure he knows that $ITVP should know that.""

tl;dr We bring in a temp to cover student move-in and $Red's vacation, folks think that the temp is a FTE and $Red's replacement. $ITVP fails to pull the trigger and get rid of $Red when she can. A lack of hilarity ensues.

906,"""The power went off and it fried my computer!!""","**May 8th, 2018. 2:43 PM**

I recently returned from lunch, and am sitting at my desk. I'm about to start updating some software when I realize it's not downloading. My VoIP phone works so it's not internet. I look at my wifi indicator and sure enough, no wifi. The lights are on, so it can't be power to the wireless access point... but... now i hear beeping. Lots of beeping. It sounds like UPS's switching over to battery power and beeping to tell the user to shut down their computer, that they've lost power. We're having parts of our office lose power, and other parts not lose power. What the fuck is going on. couple minutes later, all power is out. 

Turns out, our maintenance department was welding, and our building didn't have enough juice to power everything so we were essentially having our office brown out, but then a 600amp fuse in our electrical box out back blew, and we lost all power to the building. Awesome, I get to go home early. 

**May 9th, 9:15 AM**

I've been at work about 30 minutes by now, on my second cup of coffee, when one of our employees walks into my hallway (I don't really have an office... I'm kind of in a hallway... long story) We're doing to call this employee $Kia, short for Know It All. I'll be $JD. 

$Kia: ""Hey, $JD. When the power went out yesterday, it fried my computer. I need a new one.""

$JD: ""Did you not shut it down when your UPS started beeping?""

$Kia: ""What's a UPS?""

$JD: ""It's the giant black power strip that your computer and one of your monitors is plugged into. In the case of a power outage, it will power your computer long enough to save your work and power down your computer safely.""

$Kia: ""I don't have one of those."" 

$JD: ""Yes you do, i set up your workstation.""

$Kia: ""yeah but i moved my desk to the other side of the room, and didn't know what that was so when i moved it, i didn't use that thing.""

$JD: sigh... ""OK, let me go take a look.""

I walked over to that set of offices (We have two sets of offices in our building with a warehouse and production facility in between them). I get to his desk, sit down, press the power button, and i see the computer light up and come to life.

$JD: ""$Kia, I just pushed the power button and it came on...""

$Kia: ""I'm not an idiot. I know how to turn it on. But nothing happens on the screen.""

$JD: ""Well, did you try..."" *pushes the power button to the monitor* ""turning the monitor on?"" *monitor lights up, straight to log in screen*

$Kia: ""Uh, well, yeah, i tried it, but it uh, it didn't work for me when i did that.""

907,A tale of two consultants. No not the office space kind of consultants. Wait what? These are definitely the office space kind of consultants.,"Over the past month our company decided to ""shake things up"" and bring in a consulting firm to help ""bring efficiency to the next level."" At first everyone was very wary that this would be an resume generating event. However consulting company sent out a memo to all employees. 

They stated that their goal is not to ""synergize the core values with productivity paradigm shifts."" Basically this memo called out all of the BS terms that companies like to use and made fun of them. They stated their core goal was to look at our P&amp;P and work out how to deal with them. 

When it came to our turn for the consultants, at first they were very helpful. They mentioned that we were taking a few unnecessary steps in fixing common issues. 

For instance when outlook refuses to take the correct password on local desktop, you do not have to rebuild outlook profile everytime. A time save would be hitting ""other user"" and having the user do a full login again instead of rebuilding the outlook profile. 

Or in the case of printers. IF the IP address changes on the printer, you do not always have to reinstall it. Can simply go to printer properties and change the port. 

All of these were things that I knew and thought my team knew, but that was not the case. I had lapsed in getting KB articles out to the team for these and people were fixing issues using methods that took longer. 

I thought this was the end of it. 

Last monday. 

I come into the office and am pulled into the conference room with the head of IT, EVP of IT, and VP of networking. These consultants were done playing good cop and were auditing the tickets and calls. 

At first they ran through a TON of minor issues and ignoring them as they went on until they ""noticed a trend"" amongst some of my golden employees. The ones I refuse to let go without a damn good reason. 

&gt; $C1 = Consultant 1 or bob  
&gt; $C2 = Consultant 2 or bob  
&gt; $VPN = VP of Networking or Kara Thrace  
&gt; $HIT = Head of IT or William Adama  
&gt; $Me = Gul Dukat  
&gt; $EVPIT  = Obi Wan Kenobi 

So the first one they sent my way was a simple one. 

&gt; $C1 - We have pulled up a few glaring examples here and we wanted your input.  

&gt; $ME - *Takes a look at the ticket in question* So the user wanted us to open corrupted PDF files for them and send them back. We informed the user that the files were corrupted and closed the ticket.  

&gt; $C2 - But it did not stay closed.  

&gt; $Me - Right because the manager and the LO in this ticket had an email conversation with each other while still CCing IT and reopening the ticket over and over again.  

&gt; $C1 - So you are saying it was not the Techs fault for being unable to keep the ticket closed?  

&gt; $me - *My leg stops shaking, my breath goes still, my eyes lock in on C1 and C2 and I open my mouth to speak*  

&gt; $Hit - You do not work in our environment on the day to day and have no real grasp of the way things operate. From out outsider's perspective, this ticket looks bad. But that is why we are here as managers to look at this and show you, the outside consultant, why this is perfectly acceptable.  *Sideways glance at me in what I can only assume was a ""stop it."" glare.*  

&gt; $VPN - How many more tickets do you have like that?  

&gt; $C2 - We pulled out 12 tickets like that where the tech was unable to keep the ticket closed. 

The room goes silent. 

&gt; $ME - *My eyes lock in and I exhale slowly.*  

&gt; $VPN - *oblivious* Then skip over those. They are a waste of our time. 

The consultants pulled four tickets to the top. 

&gt; $C1 - Here is one that counts. (Name of tech) helped (user) out on March 5, 6, 7, 12, and 22nd, on what looks like an outlook issue.  

&gt; $C2 - Ticket came in on the 4th at right before midnight and got picket up first thing as the tech came in. That is normal. The tech called the user and got voicemail leaving a message. The user called back 2 hours later and the tech was able to figure out the issue was with her account and not email. An old Ipad had her account on it and kept locking her account from automated bad password tries. 

He takes a drink of water. 


&gt; $c2 - The next day the user responded saying that she only turned the old Ipad on for a second and it auto locked her again. She wanted assistance removing the account from the ipad so it never happened again.  

&gt; $C1 - This was the first instance of the tech failing to keep the ticket closed.  

&gt; $me - *My hands tighten in a very Gendo Ikari like pose*  

&gt; $C2 - The tech cleared the account off the ipad remotely and unlocked the account again letting the user know that her password was set to expire in 16 days. The user said she would change it herself. The next day her manager replied to the ticket opening it again. That was the second instance of the tech failing to keep the ticket closed by the way. Now the manager was just thanking the tech for the help so we wont count that one. However it does help us establish a pattern.  

A message over lync came in from $Hit and $EVPIT. ""The leash has come off."" I replied with. ""I will let the man finish first.""

&gt; $c2 - Then on the 12th the user replied back stating it was happening again. The tech split the ticket off as it was a separate issue. Appears to have been a simple citrix login issue as logging out and back in fixed it and that is fine. Look the tech is competent enough he just has a huge issue with a failure to keep his tickets closed.  

&gt; $Me - So... 

&gt; $C2 - Wait there is one more for this ticket. On the 22nd of March the user reopened the ticket stating she forgot to change her password and needed help. By the time the tech got to it she had already called the hotline and got it taken care of with another tech. That sounds normal... However. There is a clear progression here of a failure to maintain the tech's ticket queue. There is a clear line of failure from start to finish of being able to keep this ticket closed.  

&gt; $Hit - So If I am understanding you correctly, the issue you want us to address is randomly reopening tickets on the user end?

&gt; $C1 - No. This is a clear failure to keep the tickets closed. *takes off his glasses* You have a real problem with techs failing to keep their tickets closed. 

&gt; $Me - So that phrase you just used. ""Failure to keep tickets closed."" It is a useless metric to track. You understand that right?

&gt; $c2 - I fail to see 

&gt; $Me - A rhetorical quesiton when its posed? I wasnt asking. I was telling you... in the form of a question. You see you both know that this is a useless metric to track. You know this. You had to dig to the bottom of the barrel to find a metric to try and let people go. 

I take a drink of water and look around the room. $hit is hiding a smile, $EVPIT is smirking on the side of his mouth, and $VPN has a huge grin on her face hidden behind her hands. 

&gt; $ME - If you had come to me directly with honest intentions I would have assisted you. I have 4 contractors out there who show up late every day, who have been given warning after warning, and one who I am going to let go no matter what when he gets in cause he cussed out a customer. That would have been 5 for your sacrificial chamber and 5 less headaches I have to deal with. Instead. I am going to give the other 4 a second chance. 

&gt; $C1 - *To EVPIT* He is throwing out some wild accusations here and I am formally asking you what you wish to do about this.

908,Traitor....,"So a month or so ago Steam and Battle.net were banned from our work computers. You try and launch them and you are greeted with a message informing you that the network administrator has banned this program.

Everyone was disappointed but understood. We figured someone with power had walked through the room while two techs were engaged in Hearthstone antics and had complained to our director and that was that. 

Today I was doing some PC cleanup. I pull up my programs list and see my installed Steam games and figure I'll uninstall them since I can't enjoy them on my lunch break anymore. I click on uninstall and the Steam login pops up. I login to Steam to start the uninstall but then I realize I've just discovered something wonderful. 

I realized I can begin to uninstall a Steam game to bypass the network policies preventing me from launching it. Cancel the uninstall, launch a game, there it is. I ask my coworker to try the same thing with Hearthstone and voila, he's in! 

I tell my fellow Tier 1's and we all share a good laugh. We aren't going to risk our jobs to play Hearthstone at lunch but we are still amused with the workaround. We decide to show the Director what we have discovered. Turns out, he didn't even know Steam and Battle.net are blocked. 

The call to block these games was not made by our manager, our Director, our CIO nor anyone who is actually in charge of us. One Tier 2 took it upon himself to enact this network policy. 

He's been a Tier 2 for six months. He literally was in our seats playing these games and living this life six months ago. Our ticket counts are in better shape than they were when he was doing our job. There had been no complaints or even discussions about the change.

I'm sure sneaky behavior without management approval and betrayal will take him far in his career. 

**TL;DR: Guy gets promoted to Tier 2 tech and thinks he is CIO. Blocks our access to games (poorly) and is a hypocrite.** *and I get salty and post about it on TFTS like a salty mc saltyface*",False,1153,87,wallacehacks,talesfromtechsupport
909,Network enlightenment with a borderline-illegal punch tool,"By, er, popular demand, another story about University Boss!

**Me**: A PFY (jr. sysadmin/support person) in a large university's computer science department.

**Boss**: Sr. Computer Science sysadmin, my supervisor, bureaucratic genius, and all-around good guy.  Hero of several previous stories I've posted.

**PP**: Physical Plant, the buildings &amp; grounds maintenance department.

**Scene**: We need to run an Ethernet cable from a room to an adjacent room.  About 20 years ago.  The doors to these rooms had a nice gap underneath (this is important).

&gt; Boss: Just get a 50' UTP cable and run it under the door like the other two that are already there.

&gt; Me: Wouldn't it be better to do it properly?  Through the walls with RJ45 jacks and all that?

&gt; Boss: Trust me, under the door is way better.

&gt; Me: That doesn't make any sense.

&gt; Boss: Let me tell you a story.  Physical Plant (PP) is unionized here.  Their contract says that if any of certain kinds of work is to be done, it MUST be done by unionized PP people.  Non-unionized workers doing union work is one of the few things that can get a person fired almost instantly at a university.  A few years ago, they got network cable installation and repair added to that list.  So it would be illegal and could get the University sued if somebody else did the cabling.  

&gt; Me: That sounds annoying, but...

&gt; Boss: Also nobody trained PP how to do data cabling.

&gt; Me: ...

&gt; Boss: So here's how it goes.  You put in a work order, they show up in a week or two, about an hour before quitting time.  They put up a ladder, take down a ceiling tile, and dangle an Ethernet cable from the ceiling, then leave early for the day.  They'll come back the next day about an hour before lunch, do 10 minutes of work, then leave early for lunch.  Several days later, the network run will be done, and they'll leave.  You will then discover it doesn't work.  If you are particularly unlucky, you will also discover several existing connections that had nothing to do with the change are also broken.

&gt; Me: But I still think that we should do it properly.

&gt; Boss: You still have much to learn.  Fine.  We'll try it your way.  You'll see.  Shall we ask them to cable up those two existing runs under the doors ""properly"" also?

&gt; Me: That sounds good.

So sure enough, just as Boss predicted, a week later a PP cable installer shows up, not long before lunch.  I walk by the room a few minutes later, there's a ladder, a hole in the ceiling, and no installer.  A few days later, the work order is closed and the ladder is gone.

&gt; Boss: Follow me.

I follow Boss into one of the rooms.  Hanging out of the wall are three Ethernet cables with RJ45 ends on them.  One of the cables has a wire sticking out next to the RJ45 end, not IN it.  Also, no plates.  No jacks.  No electrical box.  Just an ugly-looking hole in the drywall with wires hanging out.

&gt; Me: Uhmmm...  You did ask for jacks, right?

&gt; Boss: Of course.

&gt; Me: What now?

&gt; Boss: I make a work order for them to fix it.

A week or so passes, and now the cables are punched down into jacks -- but still no wall plate, still just hanging out of a hole.  Another week or two and they're in a plate looking all proper.

&gt; Boss: Why don't you go test the new runs.

&gt; Me: Sure thing, Boss!

It should be no surprise to you at this point that zero out of three network ports worked.

&gt; Me: ... and so I guess we need to make a work order for PP to figure out what's wrong with the runs.

&gt; Boss: They will refuse to do that, on the grounds that it's not in their job description.  They will INSTALL and REPAIR but not DIAGNOSE.

&gt; Me: How do we deal with this then?

Boss then, with a hint of fear and a measure of secrecy, produces a punch tool I didn't even know he had (I think it was stashed behind a bunch of old [thinwire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2) NICs), took me to the jack in question, and educated me on the art of Ethernet termination, pointing out the color legend on the back side of the jacks and how the cabling didn't match it.

Now you've got to understand about Boss, he was a genius about navigating bureaucracy, but he always stayed strictly within the letter of the rules.

&gt; Boss: I am telling you, you are not permitted to repair this cable.  However, in order to figure out whether the problem was incorrect termination, you may need to move these wires.  I will let you figure it out from here.  Oh, and keep the door locked while you're using the punch tool.  In fact, just keep the punch tool completely out of sight.  Got it?

I proceed to re-punch the connections into the jacks.  Wonder of wonders, they seem to work.  I go back to Boss's office.

&gt; Boss: So what did you do?

&gt; Me: Well, I....

&gt; Boss: And before you say anything, pretend I'm the dean.  Think carefully.

&gt; Me: Ah.  Well, I, uh...  diagnosed... them.  And, uh, all of a sudden they worked.

&gt; Boss: And...?

&gt; Me: And... uhm...  maybe they were working all along and I just did something wrong?

&gt; Boss: You just took a step towards enlightenment.  Well done, grasshopper.

&gt; Me: Thanks!

&gt; Boss: Now let me ask you a question.  What do you think the likelihood is, that on at least one of those new runs, you'll find they ran out of cable and used 8 poorly-attached wire nuts to splice cables together?

&gt; Me: Uh... I'm starting to get the feeling like I'd rather not answer that question.

&gt; Boss: Another step towards enlightenment.  Would you like to crawl up in the ceiling and inspect the runs?

&gt; Me: Uhm.  I think it would be better not to know.

&gt; Boss: Yes.  And next time I tell you to run Ethernet cables under the door, what are you going to do?

&gt; Me: Trust that you know what you're doing?

911,What Happens When the Nuts Run the Asylum,"We have a device that gets numbers. These numbers are copied by hand by a tech, then some arithmetic is done on them to get the desired answer. This is all done with a calculator + pen/paper, with the results documented in an official logbook. I was asked to generate graphs of the results.

I decide I'm not going to copy thousands of handwritten digits into a spreadsheet. I go to the device, and notice that all of the results are saved, and can be exported to csv. Jackpot. Unfortunately, $Idiot walks in and threatens to fire me for touching it, and says that I wouldn't be allowed to do so without written permission from $BigBoss.

Fine. I go explain to $BigBoss. As I am doing so, $Idiot runs in, yelling that under no circumstances I should be allowed to break his systems. $BigBoss asks if I can get the data another way. Answer: yes, but it will cost me a day of typing and a few days of checking, when I can simply do it without mistakes in 15 minutes this way. I am asked to type them in.

So be it. I try to ocr the data, but unsurprisingly this fails, so I get $Secretary to type in the raw numbers for me, and we go through and check for errors. After several rounds of checking, we decide that this is as close as we are likely to get. I build the equations into a spreadsheet, print the graphs and the spreadsheets, and I'm done.

Or so I thought. It turns out that my calculations don't always match those performed by the techs. $Idiot demands that I fix them. I go through and check my work, finding no errors. I check the work done by the techs, and find numerous errors. $Idiot demands that I change mine to match the results in the offical logbook.

Oh well. So I change some of the values, color coding the the errors by type (rounding, incorrect inputs, incorrect equation, etc.). I'm sure these are going to get removed by $Idiot before the data gets passed along, but at least it makes me feel better. So I'm done?

Nope. $Idiot thinks the numbers (percentages) look better without a percent sign. He points out that he has all of the techs write their answers in this format. My explanations that you can't just write 99 when you mean 99% fall on deaf ears. So that gets changed too.

I think I'm done now, and can go back to my normal tasks, but I've been wrong before.

After that, you press the arrow to the right of the last box. I can give you the password requirements if you need me to.

*We spent a few minutes changing his email password on his iPhone to prevent AD lockout, nothing too eventful here.*

&gt; Me: Is there anything else I can help with?

915,The Critical Incident Ticket... For One Customer,"I read a story on here that reminded me of something that I forgot to share with you. I work as a mentor rep for tech support. 


 Essentially, we have our own steps of escalations when we have an outage or lots of offices/centers go down. One of these steps is to send off a Critical Incident Ticket (CIT) which goes to just about everyone up to the VP to advise that there's a massive outage. This time was different.

One day, we had one customer with no service. We were getting a new office going and this customer was going to be the first one on this office. Now, that office went down because it was new and not yet activated. I advise my Manager (M) about this.


Me: Hey, M.

M: Hi u/devdevo1919. What's up?


Me: So, we have an office down but--


M: Create a CIT!


Me: But, it's one customer and the office has not been activated.


M: It's still an office down! Create a CIT!


Me: But, M. It's only **ONE** customer on this office.


M: The process is to create a CIT. Please create one.


I return to my desk and create the ticket and send it off. I feel ridiculous because I know a lot of people way above me are going to be emailing me and asking why I created a CIT for an office that wasn't even activated yet.


Sure enough, about 15 minutes later, I have about a dozen emails from at least a half dozen different managers asking:


&gt;Why is this for one customer?


&gt;What is this for?


&gt;Why is only one customer affected?


And so on. Each of these emails had my boss CC'ed to it so I get hauled into his office to explain myself. I was honest and then M got hauled in. My boss wanted me to forward each email asking why to M so he could reply and explain why a ticket designated for massive outages was made for ONE person. 


Needless to say, M was scheduled for training on when and how to use the CIT tool and I had a few extra cups of coffee. Each manager that originally replied apologized to me and since then I have not been asked to create a CIT again unless it's a legitimate outage.

917,Wherein I must wait 11 minutes to say 23 important words.,"Ok fellow TFTSers, this just happened a few hours ago. 

So our hosting service was forced to do an emergency maintenance, and all VPNs were going to be downed for about 2 hours, between 9am and 11am. 

They called us at 8:30, making us aware of the situation and apologizing profusely. Additionally, they have a 5 minute window where they can push us up to a gig of our docs for the meantime. 

Upper Management was having a monthly meeting, with the Office Manager giving an 'important' presentation about core values or synergy or some other time waster. 

I know that most likely the OM had her docs stored remotely, so I put the host support on hold and call up to the conference room.

2 rings, then hangup. No voicemail. 

Call again. 

One ring, hangup, no voicemail. 

So I page on the intercom 'OM please call the IT dept, this is important'. 

2 minutes go by, no answer. 

So now 3 minutes left and I run upstairs to the meeting room (the meeting isn't scheduled to go live for another 20 mins or so), and wave down the OM. I was planning to tell her: ""The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have a 5 minute window to get them for you.""

She angrily waves me away and keeps talking to the room. 

I slide up next to the podium and this exchange occurs:

_Fhtagnyatta: The VPN..._

_OM: Look, whatever it is it can wait, I'm giving a presentation._

_Fhtagnyatta: The sched..._

_OM: We have a lot of ground to cover so we started early, if you interrupt me again that will be a verbal. Sit down and wait until we have a pause._

_Fhtagnyatta: Fine..._

So I get my stale donut and lukewarm coffee and sit. 

And wait. 

_Synergy... core values... encapture... life branding..._

And wait. 

Eventually she goes to open her presentation, and lo and behold 'Server not found'. 

She glares angrily at me and waves me up. 

_OM: What is going..._

_Fhtagnyatta: The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have (checks phone) a negative eight minute window to get them for you.._ 

OM glares at me like I just stomped on a kitten. 

She sent me away, and I'm scheduled to meet with the president later this afternoon. 

I might be without a job because she wouldn't let me say 23 words.  

Of course this is all my fault...

**EDIT: UPDATE** So I just got out of the meeting with the president and it basically boils down to the claim that I 'Did not follow the proper chain of communication'. 

The Office Manager was appointed an assistant yesterday. 

Mondays are my day off. No memos were emailed, no announcements made. 

I explained to the Prez that I was unaware of the change, as the OM had never before been appointed an assistant and no memos were sent out. 

Prez's response: we updated the org chart, you have zero excuses. Sign this paper acknowledging that you acted inappropriately and there will be no other repercussions, though I would prefer if you also apologized to OM in person. 

Apparently I'm expected to check the org chart every morning for changes.

So I signed the paper, because I'm addicted to sleeping indoors and eating food not from trashcans.

918,The time I convinced HR that everyone should have a character sheet.,"**Looking for a complete list of $404Comp tales? Here's the [index!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Savacli/wiki/tales)**

&amp;nbsp;

**Back Story**  
We're at the point where we are really starting to suffer from growing pains. So much so that last year we had to hire a Full Time HR just to keep up with the rate that our company was growing at. Previously, we were small enough to where HR responsibilities were split among two or three people (seminars, choosing benefits, handling internal personnel issues, etc), but it got to be too much.  

&amp;nbsp;

**The Cast**  
**$Lulu:** Our manager.  
**$TK:** Our recently hired Full Time HR. Overall super chill person. Quite the foodie too.  
**$ExtD:** For all intents and purposes, my work wife.  
**$Savy:** Yours truly, also avid fan of lemonade.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Process Improvement, eh?**  
$TK had been killing it over the past couple of months and essentially got a party thrown for her when she massively improved our benefits this year only costing us a mere $2 more than what we were already paying. Needless to say she had won favor with most departments. Thus, the next item on her list was process improvements. First process to get looked at? New Employee On-Boarding.  

&amp;nbsp;

This is where I would like to say we have an amazing New Employee On-boarding experience where all of our new guys feel fully equipped and ready to take on the world!...but I would be flat-out lying if I committed to that statement. Thus $TK sat down everyone from Operations as well as the two team leads which in this case was $ExtD and myself. she started off the meeting by going through a couple slides about best-practices, successful on-boarding....yeah, nothing too exciting. 

&amp;nbsp;

We were about to pass out when she asked the one question that brought all of our brains in unison:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**$TK:** So, let's say you have a new employee. What is the first thing you would want to tell them about your department's culture? You know, the thing that ties everyone together.  
&gt;**$Savy/$ExtD:** DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS!!!  
&gt;**$TK:** *sigh*....why am I not surprised. Well, how are you gonna communicate that to your new employee?  
&gt;**$ExtD:** Have them do a one-off campaign with $Savy as the DM.  
&gt;**$Savy:** Isn't the goal to have the new guy LIKE us??  
&gt;**$Lulu:** *rolling her eyes* Why don't we just buy him some dice or something and put them on his desk?  

&amp;nbsp;

*the heavens open up and a choir of angels sing as an idea forms in Savy's mind*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**$Savy:** ...we make him build a character sheet  
&gt;**$Lulu:** What the turkey is that?  
&gt;**$ExtD:** Wait, how do we even do that? 5th edition? Homebrew classes?  
&gt;**$Savy:** We make up our own sheet. With IT Stats and everything!!!  
&gt;**$TK:** That's sounds like ~~the worst idea~~ the most creative idea I've heard so far today!  
&gt;**$Lulu:** That sounds like a lot of work.  
&gt;**$TK:** It's the only idea that's been brought to the table so far. Going once? Going twice? Sold!  
&gt;**$Savy:** *(Internal squealing)*  

&amp;nbsp;

For the next week I worked with $ExtD to come up with a custom IT themed character sheet, and then I had $Lulu proofread it so that even non-techs could fill out the form. Once the sheet was filled out we'd have a general idea of what the new person's skill set and proficiencies are. It was so effective that we even had our currently techs fill our the form as well.  

&amp;nbsp;

919,Never underestimate a system administrator that knows how to code. Sometimes they can accomplish things that VPs can't - and eliminate the Great Day of Printing,"**Me**: PFY (jr. systems administrator and support guy) in the Computer Science Department of a large university.  Just learning Perl, and looking for things to parse.

**Boss**: Sr. CS sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.  Disliked the University ""bigwigs"", and bragged with a smile and a chuckle of his ""friends in low places"" all over campus, with whom he often managed to make good things happen despite idiocy from the top.

**UC**: University Computing, the keeper of central computing on campus, and in particular of the master class enrollment database.

**COFs**: Crusty Old Farts, the old COBOL guys in University Computing that maintained the enrollment database mainframe system.  Good-ole-boy buddies with the director of UC, who in turn was always shmoozing the president, VPs, etc. of the university, making the COFs unfireable.  They spent more effort avoiding work than doing it.  (The rest of UC was fine.)

**Scene**: The Great Day of Printing at the start of spring semester, about 20 years ago.

Each semester, on the momentous Great Day of Printing, UC would run a printout for every academic department, covering every class, listing every student that was enrolled.  These massive stacks of wide fanfold printouts would be assembled from the line printers in Central Printing and delivered to each department.  The departments would tear them at class boundaries and give them to the instructors.  Several rainforests were probably devastated by this.

The CS dept. had thousands of students taking hundreds of classes (or ""sections"" if a given class was offered at multiple times).  I always hated the start of a semester, because for several weeks, Boss and I were inundated with people having trouble logging in to the CS Unix systems.  Some of these were run-of-the-mill PEBKAC issues, but a good chunk boiled down to the stacks of paper from UC.

When various people are creating and deleting accounts for thousands of people from printouts, mistakes happen.  Boss and I spent many hours sorting them out each semester.

Boss hated it just as much as I did.  He had worked on the enrollment system years ago and knew there was a better way.  If we could just get that massive report for the CS dept. in a file, instead of a printout, we could write a screengrabber to log into the mainframe, display/download it, parse it, and automatically manage the thousands of accounts.  Boss knew this was easy.  Or, SHOULD be.

Over the course of a couple weeks talking to COFs, punctuated by ignored voicemails, etc, he had this conversation:

&gt; Boss: ... and so we'd like you to run the departmental report to a file instead of the printer.

&gt; COF: That's not possible.

&gt; Boss: Actually, it's easy.  You can do it in 5 minutes... [ explains it to COF ]

&gt; COF: Maybe, but uh, it's also against policy.

&gt; Boss: Against policy?

&gt; COF: You're not allowed to request that report.

&gt; Boss: But I already get that report.  On paper.

&gt; COF: Doesn't matter.  It's a security policy.  But there's a different report you could use.

&gt; Boss: Oh?

&gt; COF: Yes.  The per-class report.  It has the exact same output. &lt;smugly&gt;  All you have to do is put in a request for each class section.

COF said this with the attitude of ""this excuse has worked for me for 15 years.""  Because the way you run a report on this system is you telnet to it, go through multiple needlessly complicated screens to put in the request, and then wait for an operator to grab the job from the queue, input (hopefully accurately) the parameters into the program that actually runs the report, and then you wander on down to Central Printing to pick it up in a few days (or log back on to the system to see if you have a print dump waiting).  Only a very stupid person would do this hundreds of times, because it would take days.

... unless, that is, you have a green and keen PFY (me), freshly minted in the ways of Perl, eager to tackle a parsing and screenscraping job over summer.  So I worked up programs to telnet to the mainframe, automatically submit the hundreds of requests, download the results, and do the right thing to the Unix accounts.

**Finally fall semester arrived** and it was time to try out my code for real.

On the first day of class, in the space of about 2 minutes, UC's operators received several hundred requests for enrollment data from us.  They had to manually approve, run, and save the report for each one.  Since we automated and they didn't, that which took us 2 minutes took them all day.  And, for the first time in ages, we weren't dealing with so many account problems!

**One week later**: with a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his face, Boss says, ""We have a lot of people add or drop classes in the first few weeks.  We need to do this every week for the first month of class.""  Which was true.  So, off go several hundred more requests.

**Another week later**: Boss had an even bigger grin when he said, ""They've complained about me to the department chair!  He asked them if they would let us use the proper report yet.  They still said no.  Let's run the script again!""  Several hundred more requests sent out.

By spring semester, we had access to the proper report.

Boss's old friend, an insider in the trenches at University Computing (not a COF) later stopped by and said, ""Do you know how many high-up people in the university have asked for this for 10 years?  You're a sysadmin and you got what deans couldn't.""

Boss's reply: ""Never underestimate a system administrator that knows how to code.""

***

**Epilogue**: I only worked there a couple years, but Boss had become a good friend and mentor.  For more than 20 years, up until his last day on the job earlier this year, his desk was in the exact same spot it had always been.  Multiple reorganizations had happened, CS got meshed up with other departments, people were moved all over campus, and he even got transferred to a completely unrelated department.  On paper, anyway.  But somehow, somehow... he just...  didn't move.  He kept his office, right in the middle of the CS department that he loved.  He even managed to keep most of his CS job duties (which he also mostly enjoyed).  Even though he supposedly hadn't worked for them for over 10 years.

This is just one of many fond memories of The Boss.  I will miss dropping by every so often and having a good laugh about the old times.

920,We did not do it because no one told us to Part 1,"#Intro

Some time ago at a previous assignment I was in a team of 10 people supporting 1st line IT needs of a user base of 2500 users in a colossal international company $BlackSugaryLiquid. Our team was efficient and structured and led by a competent young lady $MissBoss. We would handle all sorts of office and production related IT problems and would resolve quite a lot of them ourselves. Some of our tickets we would have to escalate to back line teams, who would in turn kick it back to us when they had a solution. $BlackSugaryLiquid, while having lots of sites in different countries, had the habit of outsourcing key IT components to the South of the Himalayas ($HCL henceforth) and other low wages countries. This was met with much frustration of everyone within IT and outside of IT, since you receive the quality for which you pay.

I write this from memory so details I no longer remember could be left out

#Red Dawn

The entirety of $Finance was handled by an office in such a low wages country. They utilized a third rate ticketing system called $Tool where incoming emails were automatically converted into a ticket, complete with content and attachments. Surely such a system would have multiple fail safe's and other filters to protect it from harm, right? Most of you might see where this is going.

One glorious morning a malicious email arrives at $Finance and, being a well programmed piece of technology, $Tool happily converts this email into a ticket without any form of safety check, together with the mandatory suspicious attachment.  A poor unsuspecting woman of $Finance opened the ticket as well as the attachment inside. While she was confused and dumbfounded at the random crap that was inside of this ticket, her PC got infected with $Crypto and it started doing its thing. $Crypto had the tendency to not only encrypt things locally on your computer but was also able to see your mapped network drives and work from there. 

Within minutes it was multiplying on $Financeshare located on an important dataserver who also hosted other shares, devouring all the Financial data as well as other extremely important documents belonging to all the offices in Europe. After about one hour later we get a call that some files on $Financeshare look weird and cannot be opened and if we could be so kind to take a look. The agent who took the call informed $Missboss immediately when he verified the files and made sure the Apocalypse had arrived. Standard protocol was to inform $ITsecurity through email; they did not have a phone number (Yes, I groaned as well, bear with me). 

No one knew who was on this team since it was part of $HCL so we had no way of getting in contact with them, nor get this ball rolling faster. Nonetheless a high prio ticket was opened and cast into the chaos that is $BlackSugaryLiquid’s ticketingsystem (not to be confused with $Tool), filled to the brim with billions of backline teams. No $HCL team could be assigned to this ticket since we did not have a contact. A second email was send 30 minutes after the first, and from there every half an hour once again. Meanwhile a legion of Incident Managers was scrambling to get this resolved but with no one to turn their wrath too they barked without purpose. $Bigboss and even *$BiggerBoss** were called and informed and they too stood powerless against the nothingness. $BlackSugaryLiquid no longer resembled a company, it was a circus where the actors are on fire and we were  chained to our first row seats, condemned to watch this to the bitter end.

In the meanwhile $Crypto was chugging along, feasting on precious data and files.  

After 6 full hours after our first call we finally got response from $ITsecurity:

&gt;“Thank you for your email. We will look into the issue”

This well thought out response harvested a Mexican wave of raised eyebrows and other less civilized human expressions, but at least we had made contact AND we had a name. The legion that consisted of Incident managers and $Bigbosses got to work after hours of watching paint dry and the blitzkrieg of $Crypto was finally halted. The server of $Financeshare got taken of the network (8 hours after infection), smaller fires caused by $Crypto left and right were stomped out. To prevent the backup system from taking a backup from an infected server it was shut down and the last healthy backup was eventually restored. $ITsecurity was being manhandled in a negative way and put into place (or so we thought).

In total it took about 12 complete hours from start to finish. This does not include the aftermath of meetings and reformed SLA’s.

**Surely an event of these proportions could not happen again with these countermeasures?**

&gt;$Rimmer: Nope, I'll look up then I'll call you back! Later! 

&gt;$Boss: Something happened?

&gt;$Gost [visibly freaking out]: We got an actual fire and Rimmer just hung on me.

&gt;$Boss: Okay, go to the balcony, do what you must and get people on it ASAP.

&gt;$Gost: RIMEEEEEERRRRR

&gt;$Gost [muffled screaming]: That was the UPS...

&gt;$Rimmer: I guessed it might be something on the rack, so I opened the side! _Some smoke came out of it and the smell became worse,_ so I think we're getting hotter in this search!

ba_dum_SILENCE_IKILLYOU.ogg

&gt;$Gost: Okay, can you identify the source of the smell or smoke?

&gt;$Rimmer: Hang on a minute $Gost, I have to clear a check now.

&gt;$Gost: _mentally: Rimmer, focus. We have a fire. Is there a extinguisher?

&gt;$Rimmer: Yes.

&gt;$Gost: Good. If the worst happens I want you to use it, so let's make sure it's not a water one. What type it is?

&gt;$Rimmer: Uhh...

&gt;$Gost: What's written on it or on the sign above it?

&gt;$Rimmer: Ahh...

&gt;$Gost: There should be letters. Is it A, B or C?

&gt;$Rimmer: Ehh...

&gt;$Gost: Colors. Shapes. I need a circle. A blue circle. What you got there? 

&gt;$Rimmer: Better go back to rack and figure out what's causing this.

We decided the culprit was the TV computer, had it unplugged and removed, smell was removed, case solved, back to training. (Also, the extinguisher BC chemical powder BC, no CO2 available, ugh)

Phone rings again, it's IM with a photo.

&gt;$Rimmer: Hey $Gost this thing started whirring and smoking, so I unplugged it and everything is fine. Also we lost cameras, _is this normal?_

It was the honeycomb PSU from the DVRs that decided to go up in smoke.

After some debate on how to get a CCTV technician there ASAP (faraway branch, they failed to conjure a local), Rimmer offered himself to the task of fixing it.

&gt;$Rimmer: Let me do it! I unscrewed the terminals myself and even labeled positive and negative wire!

Why you... What should I do. While me and Boss chat about what was done and if he would allow him to go further (NO), Rimmer, the man who could not figure basic shapes, colors and reading, _successfully_ replugged them back on the second PSU anyway.

In the end our technician promises going there tomorrow (he didn't), we asked Rimmer to not endanger himself further (he did), and boss asked me to check if the remaining PSU wasn't being overloaded so it would not set the place ablaze when we were not looking (specs says not, but specs didn't say anything about not spontaneously combusting in flames so no promises).

This is different than IT support, because I know how to do editorial work, and have only a general understanding of IT.  On my first day there, one of the office staff was showing me how when I finished a job, I had to put it into their billing spreadsheet.  ""And if it's a client we don't have a record for, you should put in a new row, only make sure you get it in the right place alphabetically, because otherwise we're going to miss it.""

She was a nice lady who seemed competent, and it was literally my first day, so I figured I was probably missing something.  But I decided to go out on a limb, and ask why they weren't just sorting their spreadsheet by last name, rather than hand alphabetizing. 

It was like I had stolen fire from the gods and brought it down to their office.  Amazing!  It was going to make it so much easier for them to sort things properly!

At this point, I asked about the calculator that the lady had next to her computer.

""It's for the billing,"" she explained.  ""We put the amount we're charging for each job into the cells at the end of the line here, and then I have to add it up with the calculator to get the total amount we're billing them.""

925,The tale of the missing invoices and the wacky pricing,"This is kind of a mashup tale with two customers and two different issues (end impact to business/customer) that had the same root cause that lead to the same moral: Garbage in, Garbage out.

So I (funtimeswithaix) work for a vendor that provides software to businesses. Our software comes chock-full of different functionalities, some of which are very general, others of which are highly industry specific. In addition to allowing customers to take advantage of our having made and continually patching the parts that were standard, customers had the ability to customize code to better meet their business processes.

Of course, custom code is a thing that can be great, or a nightmare. It depends on your testing, the quality of the code developed itself, and re-testing when you upgrade the system (to make sure that changes in the standard part of the application did not require you to adjust your custom code). The software provides a full toolset to analyze changes that are brought in and identify what parts of custom code need to be adjusted or re-tested, IF you set it up (big if).

**Tale #1: The invoices that weren't**

$customerA manufactures tangible things. They make the things, they box the things, they ship the things, and they sell the things. The company does direct to consumer sales, but it represents a very tiny portion of their business. Most sales are B2B direct and thus selling the items and then invoicing the customer later with 30-90 day payment terms after customer receives invoice is far more common. They use our software for all of the major parts: Finance (including invoicing), warehousing/goods movement, etc...

Enter a few years ago. They are starting to hear from customers that:

1) The customer *did* place an order.

2) The customer never received an invoice.

3) After the payment term periods end, the customer is receiving ""INVOICE OVERDUE"" mail with penalties and threats (cut off from ordering, legal action, etc.) from $companyA accounts receivable.

The customers are pissed. $customerA is baffled. $customerA asks how this could be. $customerA gets really pushy on this, but we push back because they have used a non-trivial amount of custom code to customize this process and ultimately we agree to a consensus:

1) The software company will conduct a thorough analysis of the problem with sufficient documentation so that the customer and third parties with expertise will be able to understand the problem and fix it.

2) If the problem is due to either a legitimate bug in the standard program, or is at least in part caused by a bug in standard code - we will bear all costs of the analysis and recommendation. If we analyze it and it turns out to be due to issues in custom code, they will bear the cost of the resource's time at the normal billable rate.

(I would note that there are many cases in #2 where it is debatable in at least part that there could be no product defect, so we err on the side of caution and sometimes eat the cost of analyzing/fixing things even when the customer is to blame. The case has to be airtight and irrefutable to the responsible management.)

Sure enough, we get in there and analyze the code to find out what's going on.

In applications that are database driven, the developer is required to make a decision on when to commit to the database. You have to come up with a block of code and decide when it is appropriate to consider everything ""complete"" and then write the database. This is important because if there's some sort of failure or error in the logic, you have to decide when to abort the commit to DB and generate an error, or to commit your changes to the DB.

The customer split the logic of their invoicing into three parts with separate commits:

1) Generating the actual invoice (in DB and as PDF file).

2) Sending the invoice electronically to the customer.

3) Marking the invoice as having been sent to customer and then thus the clock starts on X days until they're not within payment terms.

\#2 and #3 should have been together, but were coded separately. Thus, it was possible for the invoice to be successfully made and for the invoice to have been marked as sent to the customer, but due to bad application logic (shoddy input handling) for the invoice to not have actually been sent to the customer. Since this happened in the background and did not happen on every invoice (it happened for a small percentage of them, it became the biggest deal when the ""unlucky"" invoice was for five or more digits and the intended recipient of their invoice lost their shit when they were being told they were late), no error dialog was generated to the end user. The custom code did not adequately log this exception for later review either.

$customerA ate crow at that one (paid for the analysis) and combined their custom invoicing code on points 2 and 3 so the DB commit would not happen unless there was a validated input, improved error handling and reporting, etc.

**Tale #2: What's in a price**

$customerB makes things, but in a different sense: They are a pharmaceutical company. Security is key, compliance (record keeping, security, etc.) is key, when moving goods (particularly making drugs in one country and exporting them to another) having all the paperwork in check is key. This company states they will be not using services of our company as much because they don't see the bang for the buck. In a show of goodwill and to try to win the customer back, I get loaned to this customer for three months free-of-charge (software vendor ate the cost, including travel/lodging to visit the customer at their own office). Like any sufficiently large IT organization, they have problems, and I'm sent there to be the guy to solve them - or at least drive the resolution.

Like many companies, a price is not a price is not a price. It depends on who you are (some organizations have more clout than others, especially single payer governments), it depends on what you're willing to pay, it depends on what your laws are on maximum amount spent/profit, it depends on how much of it you're buying (quantity discounts), etc. - thus the software has complex pricing rules. The customer had customized code on how pricing was processed because at least at one earlier point, the software in standard ""*did not meet their needs*"" (a lot of customers have a weird definition of this that is very different from their peers and does not provide any ""*special sauce*"" of an advantage, but the capability to customize code exists so they can do custom code if they believe in it). This did not affect every customer, it was based on conditional logic (some customers were priced solely in standard vendor code, others used the customer's logic as an extension)

I'm at this customer trying to help them in a variety of areas (fix some stuff while giving them new stuff that helps their business and IT in decision making or having easier lives). John, the head of the customer's developers, approaches me about the pricing issue and pushes for a solution. He is adamant that it is an issue in our standard code and implores for my help, because sending invoices out that have prices listed that don't match the discounts a customer is supposed to get is a HUGE reputation and potential legal issue (customer could be fined or face legal action from their customers, particularly government buyers). To counter this, the customer was applying manual checks on the end invoices - better than nothing, but still subject to error, and something that the program can handle on its own ordinarily.

I engage a lot of help from the software vendor side towards this and we're heads down analyzing the problem. There are a lot of back and forth phone calls, web conferences, emails, and ticket updates. 

After about a month of this, John comes up to me and offers something unexpected: An unsolicited apology. Throughout the course of the problem he had kept close tabs on it, which was unusual for his position - but he was a former developer of many years before being put in charge of them and deeply technical. Eventually he had sat down with the developers in charge of maintaining that code and asked them to do a walk-through of the application logic during pricing scenarios. He eventually was introduced to one part of the code and blew a gasket.

In the application, there are database tables that are expected to be tables of record. You commit to these tables and update them based on changes that are finalized. There are also database tables that are intended for the temporary manipulation of data. This is especially important in on-the-fly operations of custom code because if you updated the standard temporary tables, you could cause issues if you did it wrong.

The software standard code handled this table properly in pricing because those who designed it knew how to do access it and interpret the values in that table. When manipulating the data for a given transaction, the standard code would handle that in memory (ephemeral) and then update the table only when all logic was done. The customer's code modified the values of that table directly as it ran at multiple points. The end result was that if the customer's code was in the process of pricing for a customer that required the custom pricing procedure, if the standard pricing ran for a different invoice at the same time, it would get the invalid mid-manipulation data left in the table by the custom code, and that would cause it to price incorrectly.

John bluntly called it ""*an absolute embarrassment*"" and stated that the code would never have passed his audit if he was in his current position at the time it had been reviewed &amp; approved. I thanked John for this (most customers keep silent on their mistakes hoping to quietly fix it or blame the vendor and hope the vendor doesn't notice it. Since he saved us all a lot of time, I just stated that we worked together towards a resolution and fixed the issue (basically, stating the issue was resolved, without explicitly assigning any blame or responsibility). John actually took umbrage towards this and disclosed to his own management that it was their own problem, that he took responsibility for it, and that he worried about ""boy who cried wolf"" syndrome when raising issues with the software vendor in the future. It is something that has happened only a couple times in my career (where the end-user/owner actually took ownership of the issue without it being forced on them).

**tl;dr One customer has custom code that allows for them to consider an invoice ""sent"" to the customer even if the sending of the invoice fails due to bad design/exception handling. Another has bad custom code that causes some $$$ invoices to not be sent out at the agreed upon prices, causing them to face government penalties/fines. Both learn the value of properly vetting their own code.**",False,168,14,funtimeswithaix,talesfromtechsupport
926,Everything was fine!,"Long time lurker first time poster. Forgive me if there are some mistakes, english is not my native language.

I heard this old tale at my previous job and it's now dating a few years back. It was a modest size IT business with no real sense of what managing a bunch of customers' infrastructures would mean but we'll get to that eventually.

There was this business who would keep loosing network connection in the whole building for a few minutes, each day, at roughly the exact same time of the day. A quick word about the company : they managed financial operations, roughly 20 workers with about half in individual offices.

After several rounds of ""remote diagnostic -&gt; on site diagnostic -&gt; corrective measures -&gt; wait and see -&gt; rinse and repeat"" the tech guy in charge of the problem got reeeeaaaally angry and decided to spend the whole day on site to try and corner the fault.

It took him two days to find the problem. See, they were all working on a token ring network and each and everyday, at roughly the same time, one of the employees (let's call her Arabica) had the same ritual.

She got up from her chair, turned her screen off, obviously thinking it would turn the computer off, then proceded to unplug the power-strip and plug her personal coffee machine and prepare herself her traditional afternoon drink. Arabica would then unplug the coffee machine, plug back the power strip and startup her computer, utterly oblivious to the fact that she had just cut the business' whole network for a few minutes.

When confronted with the problem, her only answer was : 
&gt;""But everything was fine! I don't need the network at that time, i'm drinking my coffee!""

Suffice to say my colleague was not pleased and the whole business got a networking 101 lesson.

I always keep this story in mind when I begin to have too much faith in the end-user.

927,The ole' Contrast knob.,"So this goes back a few years to when I was an SSE3[1] @ Sun Microsystems in the mid 1990's.  I was pulling an on-call shift in Mid-America, which basically means I was fucking off on IRC because nothing was going on that was severe enough to require an on-site visit from a software nerd.[2]

Around 9pm I get a page saying there's a system in downtown $city with no output to the console so I figure it's going to be a piece of failed hardware but Central had paged out a software nerd to diagnose it &amp; order parts if needed.  The call comes in as ""No Contract/T&amp;M"" or Time &amp; Materials.  This was highly unusual because at the time my billing rate was $235/hr with a 4 hour minimum. [4]

So I get to the customer and note that the guy is an older gentleman with a big bushy gray beard and looks like he just smoked a J. [5]  He proceeds to tell me what the problem is &amp; I confirmed with him both that the ticket was T&amp;M and that the billing rate was with a four hour minimum.  Guy confirms.  

""Okay, take me to the machine."", says I.

We get back to the data center after about a 20 minute walk &amp; three separate checkpoints for ID and I take a look at the system.  This guy whom I'll call Jerry is rambling on the whole time about how important this project is and how it's such a hassle that this brand-new-out-of-the-crate machine is broken.  

The machine is a SunFire 280R[6] and this guy has a Wyse terminal[7] hooked up to it but the screen is blank.  Jerry goes through the story again about how it sucks that we ship these things broken but I ignore him and go through my mental checklist.

""Yup, it has power.  The monitor has power too.""
""Okay, the NIC is plugged into the right spot, and the console is on Serial A.""[8]
""Machine is powered up and the light is flashing telling me that it's waiting for me at the OBP.""[9]

I go over to the monitor and tap the keyboard.  
*nothing*

I check power.  Yep, it's plugged in &amp; powered on.

Instinctively my hand goes for the contrast knob to make sure the screen is firing properly and as I spin it to the right I see the little

I paused and looked at the screen for a second.  
Tapped the ENTER key a few times &amp; saw it scroll.

Look over my left shoulder at the guy, his cheeks are red &amp; mouth agape.

""Okay, well that's all sorted.  Maybe it had a bad connection, I'll make sure the boards are seated.""

I kill another 5 minutes verifying everything is good &amp; hand him the T&amp;M sheet.  

""I'm so sorry about the four hour minimum.""

928,"INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS have tried to fix this, kid. You can't.","Let me regale you with one of the times I applied the tech support mindset out in the wild, and fixed a problem 8 years in the making. TL;DR at the bottom.

Set your time machines to back when emo was still new, and if you were cool, you *had* to have a MySpace page. \(Man, that Top 8 caused a lot of drama...\)

I was in college, taking a class on practical film lighting. Every week, as a class, we'd have to go up another floor and each grab a giant lighting kit. These kits had a few different lamp types, along with stands, colour tint sheets, etc. Keep in mind, this was before LEDs were powerful and cheap enough, so all of these were old industrial incandescent bulbs that weighed a ton and were **hot**. Number #1 safety rule: If the light falls, DO NOT TRY AND CATCH IT. You'll lose a hand. Really.

In this story, I'm CC, and lighting prof is, well, $LightingProf.

During our first class, we're all sitting in the studio space. $LightingProf is giving us a lecture about lighting theory \(I knew it already and had stopped paying much attention after the safety briefing\). My wandering eyes look up, and notice a FULLY INSTALLED LIGHTING GRID. Around 25 lights, with a few different types, colour tints, and it looked to be motorized.

Cue raising of hand.

&gt;**CC:** ""Um, $Prof?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$LightingProf:** ""Yes?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**CC:** *points upwards* ""Is that a full lighting grid?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$LightingProf:** ""Yes, it is.""

30\+ students all look up, then down at the prof again. I know a few of them want to ask, but it's the first class. $LightingProf doesn't volunteer any information. I sigh and raise my hand again.

&gt;**CC:** ""Could we use that instead of these lighting kits we keep having to bring down from A/V rental?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$LightingProf:** ""Well, we could. But the lighting panel is buggy, so it doesn't really work. This way is easier.""

He then chuckles. This is funny, you see. I see where he's coming from, but now I'm curious. No, actually, now I'm ***curious***. \(Danger, Will Robinson!\)

Next class rolls around, we all grab our gear from the second floor \(many, many stairs\), have our next class. I'm itching to touch that lighting board. It's sitting right over there. But it's only the second class, and the opportunity just isn't there.

Third class. We all grab our gear. People are starting to loathe the class because of this. We show up. $LightingProf isn't there. 20 minutes pass. $LightingProf still isn't there. Some people leave, the rest start chatting amongst themselves. No one thinks to go ask the administration.

I see my chance.

I walk up to the lighting board. Turn it on. Start testing the sliders assigned for individual lights. Three lights go on. Then five. Then two. Then ten. Some overlap, but not all. And these are sliders meant for individual lights. They aren't by zone, or by colour. There's absolutely no logic to it.

A few students have drifted by, and offer suggestions. They're intrigued by how non\-sensical the board is being.

Then, $LightingProf shows up. He makes a beeline for our gathering around the board.

&gt;**$LightingProf:** ""**WHAT ARE YOU DOING?**""  
&gt;  
&gt;\*students scatter\*  
&gt;  
&gt;**CC:** ""Well, you said the lighting board was buggy. I wanted to see if I could fix it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$LightinProf:** ""Kid, we've got industry professionals on staff, and several of them have taken a look at it and can't fix it. You won't be able to.""

***Curiosity*** changes to ***Wanna bet?***

&gt;**CC:** ""Okay. Well, it's unusable now. Mind if I keep trying?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$LightingProf:** ""Sure, whatever. It's your class time. If you miss any material, it's your fault.""

Which would have had more an impact if he hadn't shown up 45 minutes into a 70 minute class. But I have my permission. And I'm angry in the way only an 18 year old can be at authority. Let's do this.

You see, I hadn't just been hitting sliders and buttons randomly. I was testing. Methodically. This lighting board was programmable, and it seemed like someone had programmed a bunch of the sliders very strangely. \(These are called ""scenes"", or at least they are when done properly\) Or multiple people had done so. I could figure out what all the programmed scenes were \(what lights were with what, etcetera\), or...

The board had a small alphanumeric display and a menu button. I hit it.

**Enter 4\-digit code**.

There's no way the prof will give it to me, even if he knew it, which I seriously doubt. I think back to what I've read about schools, common passwords, etc. What's the number of this classroom? Yup, four digits. Right.

**Incorrect. Enter 4\-digit code.**

Shrug, plug the classroom number in reverse. Boom.

I cycle through the menus quickly, see a few interesting ones. Find the one about programmable scenes. Cycle through that. There are... a lot. I nope out of that submenu. Keep cycling. Ah, here we go.

**Warning: This will reset your board to factory defaults. Proceed?**

Oh, hell yes.

The board clears, turns off, then on again. The sliders all go down of their own accord \(they were also motorized, had no idea\). Each of the grid lights then fades up and down once as the board tests. Students are now looking up and around, and $LightingProf is looking straight at me with suspicion. I'm just \(literally\) watching the light show.

The lights finish cycling through their test and turn off. I look back at the board, it looks at me, innocent as you please. I bring up fader #1. Light #1 comes up. Fade #2. Light #2 comes up. I do the same for the next 5. They all come up individually.

The class has broken down into badly whispered gossiping. $LigthingProf comes over.

&gt;**$LightingProf:** ""You got it working. Go sit down.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**CC:** ""No. I haven't tested all of the lights, yet. I don't know if it's *really* working.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$LightingProf:** \*grumbles and goes back to the gaggle of students\*

For the next twenty minutes, I painstakingly \(ie way slower than needed\) test every single light. I made sure to test some of them multiple times, just to make sure. The fact that they were the ones pointed at $LightingProf \(nothing directly in his eyes\) was a pure coincidence. Honest. The students had a really hard time concentrating on his lecture as pot lights kept coming on and off, shining off his shiny shaved head. Finally, I pushed my testing as much as I thought I could and joined the rest of the class.

Oh, but dear reader, we're not done.

Later in the day, I'm in another class, when three different $FilmDepartment professors burst into my $CompSci lab in the middle of a lecture. They go right to the $CompSci prof, in what looks like a panic.

&gt;**$FilmProf2:** ""Is CC in this class? Which one is he?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$CompSciProf:** ""Uh, yes? He's over there.""

All three \(none of them are the $LightingProf\) rush over.

&gt;**$FilmProf2:** ""Did you fix the lighting board in $Room?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**CC:** ""Uh, yeah. I just reset it to factory defaults.""  
&gt;  
&gt;All three of their faces go white.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$FilmProf3:** ""What? Why didn't anyone think of that?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$FilmProf1:** ""I can't believe it. Thank you!""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$FilmProf2:** ""That was really smart. I'm glad you worked with $LightingProf to get that working.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**CC:** ""Oh, I didn't. That was on my own. He didn't want me touching it, and got angry when I fixed it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**$FilmProf2:** ""...I see. Well, thank you.""

They left. $CompSci prof looked at me for an explanation, I just shrugged, class continued.

Next lighting class, we were told we didn't have to check out lighting kits anymore and the department had fixed the lighting board, so we'd be using that going forward. Cue grateful sighs from the class, and dirty looks to $LightingProf from everyone, as they knew exactly who had fixed it, and it wasn't staff.

$LightingProf spent the rest of the semester refusing to look at me and giving me the passive aggressive treatment. I gave absolutely no f\*\*\*s.

**TL;DR:** I fixed a lighting board that had been broken for 8 years by walking over, guessing the admin code and hitting *Reset to Factory Default*, while my professor looked on in ever\-increasing impotent rage. It was glorious.

*Edit:* Fixed formatting... Also, some numbers.

929,"QA, I'm loving it","Been some time since I posted something here. For those of you who do not know me \(so, pretty much everybody\), a little link to a story that happened almost two years ago: [Why use SQL, we got Access!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/708mxo/why_use_sql_we_got_access/) Today, I come with praise and glory for all those tough little guys in QA \- something I will miss dearly if it should ever vanish again, as most of you probably can testify for.

Sorry already for not getting into too much specific details, but $boss told me to keep my mouth shut about absolutely everything. The man is just a tiny teeny bit paranoid about our competition trying to get our juicy software dismantled and revealing all his hacks. And, gods forbid, implementing them themselves.

Now, for better or worse, I finally found a company which I am happy with doing my apprenticeship as a qualified IT specialist. Since I am the first person to do so, my $boss is pretty chilled and a nice dude all around \(also younger than me...\), helps out if I have any problems at all, keeps explaining the architecture of our software and so on. Additionally, I am not the only one they took on \- I've got two colleagues who started right after me.

After having gone through the basic processes, $boss explained to me what my new work would be: migration of our software to a newer \(architecture\) framework. Problem is, we're jumping one version inbetween, and let's just say that quite a lot happened from our old to this in\-between version... and now we're even going one step further. While doing so, a lot of stuff got broken, we're trying to keep a lid on it, but still: fixing bugs AND testing while being on a deadline is no fun at all.

Cue $sweet16, so called since this newly hired apprentice is just 16 years old. And boy, does it show. Trying to open zip ties with a butter knife when we have perfectly good scissors right next to him, than waving it around almost maiming me in the process... he has a lot to learn.

But then $boss had the brilliant idea.

&gt;$boss: Hey, $sweet16, got a job for you.  
&gt;  
&gt;$sweet16: Hm?  
&gt;  
&gt;$boss: Here's the link to our test environment. Take a shot at it and break it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$sweet16: Okay.

About five minutes and a lot of clicking sounds later:

&gt;$sweet16: Done.

To this day, I have no idea what and how he did it. But in these five minutes, he found about 20 bugs me and $boss just had overlooked, wrote a ticket for each and every one of them AND crashed the whole test server \- database, webserver, EVERYTHING \- with one single input.

This continued for the next two weeks, with me trying to keep up bugfixing while the clicking sounds almost drove me nuts. $sweet16 found bugs I'd never even think about. One was discovered by having over twenty tabs open in his browser, canceling the user account, than trying to open a menu item in another tab while still ""being"" that user and acutally being refered to another user completely. We had some fun digging into this one, and the craziest part is that it *only happened when having 20\+ tabs open in the browser.*

So, here's to all those computer gnomes in QA who happily click away and try to destroy everything I so hard worked for, and most of the times succeed in doing so. Thanks, guys and gals. Life would be a lot tougher without you.

$Selben looked at the time… 4:00am. *Oops!*


&gt; $Selben: Let’s call it for now, see you all later!


An hour later $Selben arrived at work for the early shift. He had lost track of time and stayed up all night (again) playing his favorite game, EverQuest. After stopping in the IT kitchen for ~~the glorious nectar of IT~~ coffee, he sat at his desk, rubbed his bleary eyes, and started going through his queue.
Luckily most of the day consisted of small reporting issues that could be fixed without direct human interaction, and only sending the occasional email of “Try it now.” Throughout the day, $Sup1 and a $Peer kept walking back and forth through the office, with their voices escalating as the day progressed. Deciding to not voluntarily get involved, $Selben avoided eye contact.

Towards the end of his shift, $Selben felt a presence standing close behind, and realized his uneventful day was about to be interrupted. He slowly rotated his chair to find $Sup1 looking angry, and $Peer staring at the ground.


&gt; $Sup1: Tell him!

&gt; $Peer: Uh, well… A user couldn’t connect to the WIFI.

&gt; $Selben: Okay, and?

&gt; $Peer: He was at home and I… Well, I walked him through un-installing the driver, except I forgot to have him download the new one first.

&gt; $Selben: Can he connect to the wired network?

&gt; $Sup1: No! He’s on the road. That’s totally unacceptable!

&gt; $Selben: Well, when he gets somewhere else we can work with him then.


$Sup1 grinned ~~evilly~~ happily.


&gt; $Sup1: YOU will meet him at the airport to work on the laptop!


$Sup1 looked very pleased with himself for this plan.


&gt; $Selben: Who is it?

&gt; $Sup1: It’s $VP!


Armed with minimal information about the actual laptop in question, $Selben downloaded drivers for nearly every machine the company used before driving two hours through heavy traffic to get to the airport. $Sup1 had arranged for them to meet just outside the security gates at the airport. $Selben dozed off and on in his seat while waiting for the (of course) delayed flight. He had been up for at least 27 hours by the time he spotted $VP.


&gt; $Selben: Hi, I’m here from $Company to work on your WIFI issue.

&gt; $VP: Great, this has been such a pain. I think it started after I switched to this new internet web page. You know all about those internet pages, right?

&gt; $Selben: Uh, sure.


$Selben just smiled and patiently waited for $VP to pull out his laptop as he rambled about “those internet web pages.” He pulled out his own machine, to see if there was a connection at the airport, just in case he needed one of the few drivers he didn’t download. He slowly turned to see $VP staring over his shoulder.


&gt; $VP: Now what?

$Selben’s eye twitched slightly. Lack of sleep was catching up with him, dangerously affecting his patience.

&gt; $Selben: Your laptop?

&gt; $VP: What about it?

&gt; $Selben: Can you get it out?

&gt; $VP: Out of where? My house?




It turned out to be a complete waste. $VP had left his computer back at his home and somehow assumed IT would be able to work on it.

931,Whenever I do this thing my website breaks!,"So I work for a web development company and we have a fair few clients. This client in question, however, is one of our higher-maintenance clients, still very lovely of course but they  require a lot of running around after with a fire extinguisher.

We actually didn't build their site, they came to us asking for help because their previous developers dropped support for them, goodness knows why!

A lot of stuff is wrong with it but they have a limited budget so we can't fix it all at once, even though we're getting through a lot of the issues, some still remain, so without further ado, on with the tale!

&gt; Client on the phone: Hello the site is down please can you fix it immediately?

&gt; Me: of course, what's the error?

&gt; Client: it's just a blank page


I log onto the server and notice that the site isn't down 

&gt; Me: it seems fine from here, what page are you trying to view?

&gt; Client: I'll email you the link...

I get the link and notice that the page is indeed broken, and it's being caused by a null reference exception.

The way this page works, is it takes several images from children pages and displays them. If you don't want an image to show, you need to go onto the child page and remove the image there. This client has developed a lovely habit of going to the media library and removing the images from there which doesn't update the content pages, and because the image doesn't exist anymore, a null reference exception occurs!

I explain this on the phone to our client.

&gt;Client: well is there no way to solve this?

&gt;Me: yes you need to go to the child page first and remove the image there before deleting it from the media library

&gt;Client: that seems stupid, it should automatically know when I delete it and do it for me

&gt;Me: yeah that would be useful! I'll see if we can schedule some time in to work on a tool that does that for you, I reckon it'll be about two or three days of work though, should I start planning?

&gt;Client: oh no that's far too long, we can't afford that, but the system should do it automatically

&gt;Me [internally]: well too bad, it doesn't so what now?

We explain to our client that they must must must remove the images from the child pages before removing them from the media library on the phone and in a follow up email.

The next day the client phones up with the same issue and we go through the same steps to explain the problem and the workaround.

Then the next week, the client calls with the SAME issue! The same diagnostics occur and the same brief is given to the client.

Then three more times over the next month, each time we're told the cost to implement a fix is too great and that the system should just do it.

And now I've just finished fixing the issue again and came here to write this! Soon there'll be a palm-shaped indentation in my forehead! 

We don't charge to fix this as all the client has to do is get the image back out of the recycle bin, but it's just really funny how often this happens when they have been told a hundred times how to avoid it!

Hope my formatting is alright and I hope you all enjoy the story :)

edit: to the people pointing out that it costs us to fix it every time it happens, we just tell the client to restore the image from the bin, we don't actually do anything

further edit for clarification: they are paying us a lot of money for other work we're doing, we're technically _losing_ money on this issue as you have all pointed out, but, we figure it's better to keep them sweet than cause a fuss over the £50-100 it's cost us so far.

Primary Characters: Myself, SalesForce1, SITBricks, and Overboss.

So my company runs a morning meeting on Mondays to get everyone caught up on the last weeks issues and to highlight the coming weeks issues. I am fine with this because its an extra hour of pay to sit their and listen to people talk about the work I have to do.
They mention that we have picked up a new big contract for a site that has not had any sort of real IT before and we are going to be giving them their first network. 

This is problematic to me since were primarily not an IT company but I figure that SITBricks may for once have some useful abilities IT wise and I won't have to carry the workload for my two man team. Maybe even finish something I'm trying to do to our server at the office.
Then I get asked to stay for the after meeting by Overboss and all my NOPE senses start screaming that a very large buck is about to be passed. Sit my butt back down and start to plan how much Caffeine I can safely consume to try and get my workload for the week done by Tuesday or Wednesday so that I can devote two days to what ever mess I'm getting. 

SalesForce1: "" So Dead we are going to have you do the Domain controller deployment for Big Company because you have experience 'INTERNAL EMPTY WAIL' because you have done this sort of thing before and SITBricks will learn."" 
DeadTechHead: "" Ah so have we gotten user account information for BIG COMPANY yet?""
SITBricks: "" Well no I don't really know what info we need so I was hoping you could show me.""
DeadTechHead: ""Ah, so we are doing this install in 3 weeks right?""
SalesForce1: "" Actually we moved it up because they are really eager to get some real tech support.""
DeadTechHead: "" Did they mention why?""
Overboss: "" Does it matter?""
DeadTechHead: "" Well yes we need to know exactly what they expect to get out of getting this service through us. We dont want a repeat of COMPANY_TRAGEDY.""
Overboss: "" But you can make a domain server? Right?""
DeadTechHead: "" I can make a generic Domain/File server no problem but depending on the expectations and access levels needed by users this is going to have to have more effort...""
SITBricks: "" Don't worry OverBoss we can get this done.""
SalesForce1: "" I knew we could count on you SITBricks!""

We escape and I make my way down to the Fridge next to my crying cave which they so recently renovated to include a desk for SITBricks. Wishing I was still working government contracts because nothing their moves this fast without 15 stamps of approval meaning I can stop it before it roles over me. Only to be ambushed by SITBricks: "" So what can I do to help get this done?"" 

Because apparently outside the meetings with people who need to be told to slow there roll I'm the lead. Right. Ok.

DeadTechHead: "" I need a full list of user accounts and services for the company, A list of file locations and hierarchies for the current network and where they are going in the new scheme, and the hardware specifications you left me out of for planning 3 weeks ago.""

Repeatedly.  Throughout the night.  Every night.

&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “So, today’s the day, eh?  Why’d you bring yours?”

&gt;**MechanicBob**  “Yup!  The guys from Training wanted me to follow them and take video.”

I watched, totally captivated, as he activated his little MagicPro Quadcopter Drone which took up station about ten feet over our heads and just off the left wing of one of our planes.  Two techs worked around a larger drone which was surrounded by a halo of foam, while a third tested the raspberry pi control boards mounted on the drone itself.  Two more of varying size sat on the table, silent and watching.  

The techs in question were a small group of developers out of Ukraine and what they’d brought to our hangar was a proof-of-concept inspection drone. In aviation, lightning strikes are a big deal—they eat time and money just from the tedious inspections required alone, not to mention the various repairs they incur.  A lightning strike inspection requires on average four personnel for a smaller aircraft and a multitude more for larger if you want to complete it in any sort of acceptable time limit.  Those people inspecting the plane have to examine every inch of the fuselage searching for little scorch marks or micro-welds on rivets that would indicate static discharge from lightning in addition to the more obvious damage.  

The idea behind the drone was to be able to set up this drone, tell it what kind of plane it was scanning and then push the **GO** button.  It would fly around the aircraft taking video of every inch while an analysis algorithm would scan the video for signs of damage.  It would be a huge workforce multiplier, freeing up mechanics and inspectors to actually work on aircraft by allowing only one person to inspect the aircraft.  

Problem was, in this case, it was *very* unproven technology.  Testing required an actual aircraft to test the drone with, but the idea of letting an unproven autopiloted drone fly around a multi-million dollar aircraft was not for the weak.  This is why they’d come to us—as $AviationCompany isn’t exactly small a drone-strike on the test aircraft wouldn’t impact us nearly as hard.  Furthermore, if we could get in on this technology at the ground floor it would be a game-changer for the industry and put us ahead of the competition yet again.  

But all the same, we wanted to avoid any sort of damage to our aircraft on the principle of the matter.  Thus, the extremely controlled nature of the tests.  They had spent the past week testing the system in an empty hangar bay and today was the first and only day they’d have access to a plane.

The Ukrainian team had set up RFID markers around the aircraft, defining its size and shape to the drone controller.  Everything had been input and MechanicBob’s MagicPro was under his manual control and observing the whole test, recording with its high-quality gimbal-mounted camera.  

&gt;**DroneManager** “Okay, are we ready to test?”

The three Ukrainians nodded and gave their approval.  

They had programmed a flight path into the smaller-non-foam-shrouded test drone’s navigation system and as soon as one tech had deposited the quadcopter at the start point the tech running the controls hit the *execute* command.  The drone leapt into the air and hovered for a moment, before suddenly deviating from the flight path and instead heading straight for the engine inlet at growing speed.  The tech hit the safety cutoff and the drone dropped like a string had been cut, shattering across the hangar floor.  

I winced and looked over at DroneManager.  

&gt;**ZeeWulf** “That’s gotta hurt.”

&gt;**DroneManager** “Naw, it’ll be fine.”

The techs gathered up the piece of their bird and out came zip ties and fresh tape—the drone was reassembled in minutes and the controlling tech was pouring through his code, searching for what had gone wrong.  Over the next couple hours this scene would repeat itself, to include with the larger foam-wrapped concept drone. It turns out the navigation system was made to look at the hangar ceiling to gain its bearings, but there was so much depth and shadow up there the system couldn’t make heads or tails of it.  From what I understand, they never did make it work.

MechanicBob, meanwhile, brought his own drone back to the table and landed it precisely from where it had taken off from.  I stepped over to look at it, and as I looked down I groaned in exhaustion.  It turns out in the dark entryway that morning, I’d slipped onto my left foot a dress shoe to match the slacks and polo I was wearing and onto my right a tennis shoe.  And I never noticed the difference in feel, as Sprout had tired me out.  

Mrs. Wulf was, needless to say, greatly amused when I got home as she passed me Sprout to watch while she slipped off to get some much-needed sleep.    

I still want that little drone that MechanicBob had, though...

934,Replace everything. Twice.,"This story takes place almost 30 years ago.  Green-screen CRTs were still a thing.  Computer technology was only a hobby to me at the time.  I was working a job as a clerk at a small chain store that was replacing their cash registers with computers.

Cast:

Me, the Dumb Clerk ($DC)

Professional Tech ($PT)

$PT installs new computer register system, but it remains powered off.  $DC and co-workers must continue to use old register.  Boss says new system doesn't work and $PT has to come back out to fix it.  $DC was not working the day the system was first installed.

Visit 1:  $PT attempts to load something from 3.5"" floppy drive, met by failure of some kind.  After multiple attempts and poking around inside the server, $PT announces that the floppy drive is bad, and they will return with a new one soon.

Visit 2:  $PT installs a new floppy drive.  Still unable to load service disk.  More repeat attempts and mild cursing by $PT, followed by ruling that the initial bad floppy drive must have caused a failure in the motherboard floppy disk controller.  $PT will return with new motherboard.

Visit 3:  $PT installs new motherboard.  Still unable to load service disk.  At this point I strongly suspect $PT is 100% making this up as he goes along.  Much fumbling later, $PT says the new floppy drive must have been damaged by the bad motherboard, and in turn it damaged the new motherboard when it was connected.  $PT will replace floppy AND motherboard next visit.

Visit 4:  $PT installs new motherboard and floppy drive.  Still unable to load service disk.  It may have been my imagination, but at this point $PT looks like he wasn't to sit in the corner and cry.  Having been unable to curb his curiosity, $DC has been carefully watching over $PTs shoulder during the entire process.  Being only a PC hobbyist, $DC has been cautious to stick his nose where it doesn't belong, but he has noticed something that looks really important, and decides it is time to throw down.

$DC:  ""I don't mean to tell you how to do your job, but it sure looks like the floppy cable is damaged here at the ribbon twist before the connector...""

$PT:  "".....  err .... perhaps it tore when I replaced everything.  I'll bring a new one back tomorrow""

Visit 5:  $PT installs new floppy cable, and order is restored to the universe.

I'll forever be curious if that floppy cable was EVER good...",False,167,9,jesusfreek,talesfromtechsupport
935,"I'm sorry, I'm just so distracted by the badness.","

Back when I did HIPAA vendor reviews for a health insurer, I saw the gamut of offices, from shiny downtown high-rises to generic office parks to some makeshift arrangements.   

  

One of the visits stands out. The vendor in question handled a niche product, like orthotic shoes or prescription lenses. For the story's sake, I'll call them 'MedShoeVision'. In addition to verification that the product or service was justified under the various insured's plans, they also shipped products to customers or contracted with medical personnel for discount plans. They held a lot of healthcare data for such a small company and my employer was concerned.

  

MedShoeVision operated out of a 'med-tech incubator', shared office space in an urban hospital with excess capacity. I had to dodge patients in gurneys, medical staff and the like to find MedShoeVision's offices.  

  

Our meeting room was originally built as an examination room- the cabinets were still in place, with a small table wedged uncomfortably in the corner. I'm working with one IT security staffer and a compliance person from MedShoeVision along with one of the compliance lawyers from my client, Large Health Insurer. In another corner is a running PC, with some medical practice software open on the screen.  

  

Two hard drives, not in cases or even sleds are connected via SATA ribbon cables and are resting on the top of the case. Blinky lights tell me they're live.   

    

  

These reviews are often a guided conversation around how the vendor does things and whether or not they worry us. They've seen the questionnaire so I'm focusing on answers I don't like and answers I'm not sure of. They're pretty together, but every so often,  I'll focus on this PC of horrors and kind of blank out. Eventually the IT security person notices my divided attention.  

  

IT Security guy:""Is there a problem?""  

  

me(pointing at the PC that shouldn't be):""Well, what the hell is that?""  

  

I see the IT security guy deflate. He sighs and says:""I've told the hospital people multiple times that this is a problem and they just shrug their shoulders""  

  

me:""As long as it isn't yours, I'll give you a pass just to stop looking at it""  

  

IT Security guy:""I'll take that deal""  
  
I was driving home ten minutes later.

937,Chapter 18 - Inappropriate Behaviour,"Tales is back, for those that still know me; read on. For those that don’t know me; my 16 part series from 5 years ago can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesfromTales/comments/17vprw/collection_tales_from_tech_support_series/) and provide some background to parts of these stories.

Five years after that series ended I will finally post the 2 chapters I never posted about my job at a callcenter after the incident in the computer store from Ron and Don.

I wrote these stories about 5 years ago, but was unable to publish them as the manager in this story heard about it because I shared it with someone still working there, and it quickly spread on the department. And well; he threatened to sue me. I wasn’t sure he would actually do it \- or would be able to win \- but at that point in my live I wasn’t prepared to go to court over a reddit post, mainly due to the costs involved for something like this. So I never posted them.

About a year ago though he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for a number of fraud cases as well as multiple assault charges and numerous incidents with the police. Given so much time has passed since this story and about 4\-6 years will pass before he is eligible for early release; I think I’m safe in posting this. Otherwise I hope GoFundMe is still around by then.

=====

During the month the manager was suspended nothing much happened. When he came back everybody expected him to lash out to everyone, particularly lash out to me. But nothin happened. He seemed calm when he came in and was for the days afterwards I was told. When I came in on Friday to start my shift I had expected him to talk to me. But he did not.

Another few weeks passed by with nothing out of the ordinary happening. We had some new joiners during these weeks. One of them was a woman that did not particular stood out, but the manager seemed to have found love at first sight.

The woman he liked was a woman that was in here late twenties and came from another helpdesk company. She wasn’t particularly smart, but she did her work well and without issues. You had no reason to dislike her.

But given the manager had a crush on her he put her on improvement programs in which he was to mentor her, and weekly meetings to discuss her performance. People that had worse ratings than her did not get anything further than a “you have to show better results next month” comment.

I’m not sure if she started dating him because she could benefit from it, or if she was in any way pressured by him to do so. But in the weeks after they had been spotted around town by multiple colleagues already. I had decided to stay out of it, and kept doing my work.

In between this time I had gotten another customer that had downloaded the software in question from a third party website, which had repackaged the software with some intrusive spy\- and adware. The customer was calling to question us as to why we had hacked his system. It took me a while to figure out that he had installed the software from a third party, and in the process I advised him to download a free anti\-malware removal tool, something like Malwarebytes and then redownload the software from the official website.

The next day I got transferred a call from a colleague, saying the customer wanted to explicitly talk with me and given my name was attached to his support ticket she forwarded it, we did it in some cases. He was angry with me; saying his system got infected even more. After half an hour of troubleshooting I found out that he had not downloaded a free version from the legitimate version, but downloaded a cracked version; because a pro version would probably find more, and he did not feel he should pay for it. In the progress he infected himself even more. And I was to blame.

Fuck my life. Seriously. I did not want to deal with this anymore, and cut him off in his story. Telling him we did not support using pirated software, and if I would support him I would be criminally liable and face the internet privacy police. I ended the conversation right there and then. I did not mind getting let go over this. I mean, we can all only accept up to a certain level of stupidity before reaching our breaking points. Apparently Quality Control thought the same, as my case note had only one remark made by them; justified.

During the same time we got a frequent caller; his name was Dietrich and he would often call on one of our larger contracts. The product in question was quite complex and had many many features, so at first we did not notice him to much. The knowledge base was quite extensive and this particular contract made it that the client wanted as few calls as possible to second line, so we were allowed to do more than on other contract.

So Dietrich blended in with the call volume for that product at first. He was noticed by everyone in the team as he would call, and if the voice answering was male he would quickly disconnect and call again. If the voice was female he would stay on the line and ask arbitrary questions about the product.

This went on for a few weeks, in which many theories about Dietrich were formed in the office. In that sense Dietrich brought the team together more than the mandatory 15 minute morning get togethers we had. Though he did not release our stress like the Animal Shake did.

At first it was innocent; we thought he was just a user of the software that did not understand it. Maybe he had a learning disorder or other mental problems. He seemed OK further, aside from his weird behaviour and mannerisms in talking. This went on for weeks, and he started to become irritating, but nobody filed an complaints.

After these few weeks he become more deranged and one of our female colleagues remarked that she had the feeling he was mastrubating to the conversations. As time went on more female colleagues came to the same conclusion, and when I had him on line I could tell he was indeed doing that. I ended the call right then and there. I was not getting paid enough to be dealing with this.

We collectively filed a complaint internally and gave the numbers he called from to get blocked on our systems. The complains went through and IT would look at getting the numbers blocked, but as most of it was outsourced it took weeks before they did it. 

In\-between the hundreds of normal calls we would handle the change of getting him was relatively low, but each time you would pick up the phone it would be like playing Russian roulette. He kept changing numbers calling at different times. His conversations became more agitated and he started to insult male staff when he got them on the phone, and saying sexually explicit sentences out of context for any female staff. We would hang up as soon as we heard him and note down numbers to have those blocked as well.

Together with HR we filed a police report, hoping they would be able to track this man down. His calls got sparser over time until they stopped. We heard nothing from him in 2 weeks time. We thought it was over. It wasn’t.

What was over though was the relation between the manager Danny and the woman from the office that had recently joined. She cheated on him and broke up afterwards and left the company. She also had filed a complaint with HR and a police report for sexual harassment. I don’t know if any of that was true and I frankly just wanted to keep out of it. But it put Danny in a foul foul mood and he was terrible to everyone.

He jumbled the shifts to annoy people he did not like. He fired a couple of people that seemed to be in happy moods \(Again, students, the disposable workforce of callcenters\) and reacted disproportionally hard to mistakes people made or when someones ratings where bad enough to have a drop in department metrics.

It stopped being fun real quick. I was already at the point where I wanted to leave, but I wanted to ride it out until summer vacation, go back to my family for the summer and find something new when I returned for the new school year. 

It happened on a Friday at about two in the afternoon. You see, Dietrich was still obsessed with the female staff. And during the weeks he did not call he was busy researching where we worked apparently. The building we worked in was shared by multiple companies and security was non\-existent. So he easily walked in the building and after a while he found out the floor that we were on.

He went in and found the first female staffer sitting at her desk. He grabbed her chest from behind with both arms around her and pushed his head next to hers. He said “I love you” which was followed by a scream from her and everyone looking at her direction. Two nearby students quickly reacted and pulled him off her with much trouble. Another quickly helped the girl getting away from him.

While the students were trying to keep him under control he managed to escape and quickly ran towards another female coworker and grabbed her as well, holding her firmly.

At this point the manager also came into the picture and tried to assess the situation. The man started shouting that the he was in love with the woman here and wanted to marry them and that they were ignoring him and they needed to be punished and come with him. He was rather deranged at this moment.

Before all this happened and his calls were still innocuous I had already suspected that this was someone with limited mental abilities so I tried to be as nice and patient as possible. When he started to become more sexually explicit I stopped doing that and hanging up. Same was true for a colleague named Shannnon.

He started shouting he wanted to meet Tales and Shannon and wanted to marry us and we needed to come with him now. The manager pointed at the both of us and casually said “go with him, you are whores anyway, all woman are”. He looked at the deranged man and said to him “don’t bother with them, they are gonna leave you anyway, the all do“. He then walked out as if nothing was going on.

Me and Shannon were both aghast with what we just heard, but the same students that tackled Dietrich the first time, now used the confusion to tackle him again and keep him pinned until the police came a few minutes later. All in all it lasted 20 minutes. 

After the police had taken statements from me and my colleagues the manager came in again and demanded everyone to knock off with this nonsense and to get back to work. I mean, nobody got hurt or died, but two woman were put in very uncomfortable positions and two 19 years old had to handle the situation; the manager did nothing, if anything he made it worse.

I decided then and there that I wanted no more part of it, when I walked out to go home the manager threw a fit. I got in an argument with him about what he did and didn’t do just now. But he kept his ground saying he did nothing wrong.

He would never understand what he did. It was pointless. So I walked out, never coming back. A few weeks later I got a legal letter stating my termination due to non\-show and inappropriate behaviour on the workflow.

The manager did again get into trouble, but managed to turn everything around and blame me for a large part of the incident. Over the weeks after a lot of the students quit as well so nobody was left to counter his story.

As for Dietrich, I later found out that we was a mental patient and he had driven 6 hours to our building on that day. As the police were involved it all eventually went to court and he got mandatory mental treatment  from what I heard. I never heard from my prospective husband again, neither did Shannon.",False,409,64,TalesFromTechSupport,talesfromtechsupport
938,What do you mean it's all gone?,"So, Family Member (FM) got a new Mac a few months back. His old one had taken one too many spills, and was going to cost more to fix than a new one would cost, so there you go. The old one still booted in Target Mode, so it was easy to get his data back.

The old Mac was terribly disorganized. A gazillion files on the desktop, 10 copies of the same file downloaded in his Downloads, etc.

I created a folder on his desktop called ""Files from Old Mac"", inside which there were new folders like ""Old Mac Desktop"", ""Old Mac Documents"", ""Old Mac Downloads"", etc. Our very first conversation before I handed over the new Mac?

&gt; Me: Hey FM, there's a folder on your desktop that's called ""Files from Old Mac"". All of your stuff from the old computer is in there. You should go through those folders, 1 at a time, and copy over the stuff you want to keep from the old Mac. Copy from ""Old Mac Documents"" to the ""Documents"" folder, and so on, ok?   

&gt; FM: Ok, that's a great idea. I really need to clean stuff up. This will make me do it.

&gt; Me: Good deal. Your bookmarks and keychain were sync'd to iCloud, so those came right back.

&gt; FM: That's great! Thanks a million! (he gave me a $10 gift card to Target. just shy of a million...)

Fast forward a few months, and we're at a family thing at FM's place. That conversation?

&gt; FM: I can't find any of my old documents. I really need to find them. Like yesterday.

&gt; Me: Ok, remember, I made the folder on your desktop called ""Files from Old Mac""? You were going to go through the files and copy the ones you really wanted over to the regular directories.

&gt; FM: I don't remember anything like that at all.

&gt; Me: You were all pumped about how you were going to take the opportunity to straighten things up, like it's Spring cleaning or something like that.

&gt; FM: Well, here, show me where the files are (whips out computer).

&gt; Me: Well, they *were* right here on the desktop. Did you delete them?

&gt; FM: Well, I deleted the folder with the old stuff, since I figured that was out of date and all.  
  
&gt; Me: You deleted all your old Mac's files then.
  
&gt; FM: You can get those back, right?

&gt; Me: No, the machine's been formatted and recycled for parts. If you deleted the files, they're gone. Can you restore from backup? (I handed him an external hard drive when he got the machine and showed him how Time Machine works). 

&gt; FM: I've never used that backup thing. I couldn't remember what to do. I can't believe you'd let me delete everything.

Yeah, so I'm the guy who rescued your data, told you to do backups, etc. I'm *not* the guy who deleted the data, and I'm also not the guy who ignored the advice to do the backups. But I'm the bad guy somehow, because ""computer magic"".",False,3354,252,microseconds,talesfromtechsupport

Otherwise I hope GoFundMe is still around by then.

-----

So about a year after the rather abrupt end of my employment at Ron and Don’s computer\-store I entered the workforce again. I had decided against working in retail again, for reasons you are sure to understand by now. So when a technical Helpdesk position came available it seemed to be the best option available for me. It was only for about 16 to 20 hours a week to supplement my student income.

After a few days I got a call back on my online application; Someone called Danny, who was the manager of this callcenter was on the other side of the line. During the conversation \- which had been completely normal up to this point \- he suddenly put down the horn out of nowhere, allowing me to still listen in to what was happening on the background.

Apparently someone had entered the office, and he started screaming obscenities at someone in his office. It ended with a Trump\-esqe “You are Fired” tirade with a voice that was beyond breaking from the shouting. He then came back on the phone, said sorry which his now hoarse voice and continued on with the conversation as if nothing happened.

I thought I knew better by now; to identify red flags when they present themselves so bluntly. But clearly I still had a lot to learn. I was to come to the office for a 2nd interview

The second interview was with a woman; a manager from another department in the company who was nice, but preoccupied with other things it seems. Given it was just a job to earn some money to cover student living costs I didn’t think much of it. A couple days later I got a hefty package in the mail with my contract and other documents.

I started on a Friday as my off\-days as a student were Friday through Sunday for the semester. I would work every week on Friday and Saturday with the option to do Sundays in case it was needed. For example with big software launches some companies would buy extra capacity on Sundays.

The company itself was quite big and bid on anything that could be done over the phone or otherwise remotely. From software support, to insurance to magazine subscriptions to cold\-calling.

It was rumoured that one of the owners also owned a sex phone / texting line.

The team I joined was about 75 people working for 24 different contracts. Everyone would start with one contract and over time add more contract to our skillset. Training consisted of little more than showing which buttons to press on the call system, knowledge base and call log software for billing. All contracts where first line only so anything more complicated than what was in the knowledge base would have to be pushed to second line support, which was often handled by the client itself.

The team itself was a mishmash of students, college dropouts, a number of people in workforce re\-integration programs \(to go from welfare to a paying job again\) and about 8 people who had been employed at this company for 10 to 15 years. I can’t help but wonder if that constituted a human rights violation.

Most people kept to themselves; you are mostly dealing with the customers anyway, and helping someone else or just talking idly could hurt your ratings. Ratings directly influenced your pay because the monthly performance bonus was about one third of your salary.

The call volume was way too high for the amount of people that were in at any given moment. So it was easy for most to reach their targets, but at the expense of a high number of people quitting due to a burn\-out or finding something better. That was why most of the labor force were expendable students.

After a brief introduction by one of the people working there I was on my own; having to take calls. Luckily I was already familiar with the particular software I was assigned too, as it was one of the programs I had to use in school as well. So the first 2 days went by without to much problems. But I did notice I rarely talked with anyone on the team.

There wasn’t much of a team, rather an assorted amount of people that would show up at a certain time do their work and leave again at another designated time.

The company had problems with a government agency regarding the high burn\-out rate and a number of lawsuits that had been filed by ex\-employee’s over their health issues caused by the high demands of the job. As part of a settlement \(and cover themselves for future litigation\) they launched as wellness program that started after my first week at the company.

It was trying to foster a team\-spirit, and even worse, a company spirit. A lot of cheesy posters about good working habits and a mandatory show up 15 minutes early every morning to do a quick team power session.

So during the first session we had something called the Animal Shake. The idea was that wild animals, like zebras, gazelles and giraffes would have a huge adrenaline boost when they need to flee a predator. After they have escaped they shake their body and limbs to release that energy and go on with their day. So we were to jump around and shake our legs and feet to reinvigorate ourselves. The instructors said that they know some people may not want to do it at the office in front of everyone, so they could do it on the toilet instead.

One of the guy students loudly made the remark that it would explain why the male toilets are always so disgusting, if everyone is doing the Animal shake while doing number one and two. It was a witty remark, it did not mean anything, it made people laugh, and lightened the mood.

But the manager \- Danny, the one who I had the first call with \- was also present and he apparently was under a lot of pressure to make this work for compliance with the government agencies and lawsuit agreements and he went ballistic at the guy.

The student made a remark that he should maybe try the animal shake to release his stress. Some people \- including me \- laughed, some knew better and braced for impact.

The manager became visibly red and started shouting “You are the reason this team does not work”, “People like you ruin it for everyone!” and finally when he calmed down a bit \(without doing the Animal shake\) he said \- in front of the whole group \- “you are fired, get your stuff and don’t come back”. He then walked out, leaving everyone unsure what to do next.

I did not know what to do a week later when that same manager stood next to my desk and said we needed to talk. We walked to his office and had me sit down before he started talking; “we need to talk about your resolution times; they are way too high and you are not putting enough calls through to second line”.

I retorted; “but isn’t it my job to resolve the issues of the caller without escalating to second line?”. He looked at me as if I was the dumbest person he ever met. ”It doesn’t work like that you know, you are a pretty girl, so I don’t expect you to understand. But I need you to understand, so please listen carefully”.

Let me tell you that sexist comments are never fun to hear; but personally I find them even worse in German. Though I am German, I never liked the German language. It’s coarse and barbaric and lacks the subtleness of many other languages. Sexist comments In German sound even more uncivilised.

Apparently billing was based on a monthly fee which had a total number of calls in it. The contract was purely based on taking a call, not the duration or providing a solution. Just taking the call. So having customers call back often and pushing any questions we can’t answer in under a minute to the client second line support was very profitable for the company; so they heavily pushed us to escalate. It’s just that nobody had told me that in the first week.

One of my calls I got was from someone who had pirated the software. The developers put in some countermeasures to limit functionality during use when it was detected the software was pirated. Basically reverting it to only being able to view the files, but not editing or saving anything.

This was known functionality to us, and we were to inform the “customer” that he needs to buy a valid licence in order to use the software fully. He insisted he bought it, but could not provide any proof that he did. He started to become abusive, and as usual started bitching about seeing the manager, and how as a woman I’m incompetent and am unable to comprehend how important it is that this software works.

We are not allowed to hang up on customers, and every time we do hang up before the customer does the call is recorded and flagged for review by a separate quality assurance team. The manager took out any reprimand he got for problematic calls out on the team and the person with the most calls reviewed in particular. So everyone tried to limit the amount of quality reviews they got as much as possible.

So I decided to escalate to the manager as per request; I mean; the customer is king right? Well the manager was already pissed that day, and after getting this particular client and listening to his problems, I saw him starting to boil. It did not take long for him to get into heated argument with the person on the line and Finally blast into a rage overwhelming everyone in the office with his vocabulary of swearwords, before hanging up the call and walking away from my desk.

It did not take long for this outburst to make it’s way through the company and his manager showing up on the department floor. Despite his terrible personality and anger problems he did manage to turn the department around from a loss department to one of the most profitable ones of the company. So they were unlikely to let him go.

The internal quality team found that I had done nothing wrong, so I received no reprimands. The manager was suspended for 1 month, but from the rumours it was only for show and he still got paid during this time. The only good thing that had come out of it was that he had to follow anger management classes. Though this was on the cards for a long time already as this wasn’t his first outburst they had to deal with.

I wanted to leave, but I was low on cash and wanted to stay on at least 6 more months until I finished my first year, got the yearly bonus \(however little it was\) and could get back to my family for the summer. I would have finished up those 6 months; but then Dietrich happened.

940,Backup? What backup?," \[Family member\] let a laptop update to Win10 during the forced updates period and then waited two months to tell me to fix it. The problem? It was an older machine and there were no Win10 compatible drivers for some crucial bits of it, and he didn't tell me until past the 30 day rollback period. \[FM\] continued using it for a long time, bitching all the while, I'd go and do maintenance on it periodically and eventually some drivers showed up, but not all of them. \[FM\] swore up and down there was no backup of the original win7 install to revert to, so he had to tough it out with his semi\-functional machine running an OS that was never meant to run on a laptop made on 2012.


Eventually \[FM\] dropped a glass of juice on it and thought he'd killed it. When I took the replacement machine \(a newer retired fleet refurb with win 7\) I bought over there to transfer backups from his current backup drive \(he'd learned, I guess?\), we discovered that, yes, he'd run a backup on an older backup drive he had and that when we experimentally booted up the ""dead"" laptop, and it asked for an image, he plugged in this one drive and it ... restored to win 7. With the backup and windows image he swore didn't exist.


So now, I'm stuck with cleaning up this juice spattered 6 year old machine for \[Other Family Member\]. It was hers first anyway. This almost makes me miss phone support.

941,That's not really how you're supposed to use a password manager...,"Just a quick and minor one.

We use paid-for $FinalPassword here to manage the myriad of cloud services we use.

On Friday, I joined a webinar from $FinalPassword on the topic of password sharing. Since $FinalPassword Enterprise has a lot of shiny features, I've never poked around in it much beyond the account screens. After the presenter points out policies and how to view the history in it, I open up the log viewer to check it's been applied.

Imagine my surprise when I see this:

**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for abc.com  
**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for def.com  
**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for ghi.com  
**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for jkl.com  

For the uninitiated, the warning means that the 'master password' for $FinalPassword itself is being re-used on a myriad of other sites. The whole *point* of a password manager is that you can use multiple passwords (ideally randomly generated) for different sites and only need to remember the master. However, $Colleague has basically got the password manager remembering a single password (its own) for each and every site.

I pulled $Colleague aside and gave them a short lecture on why this is a phenomenally bad idea with the number of leaks, meaning just one of these sites could end up compromising the whole company (including anything that gets shared with them via $FinalPassword), and how he really, really needs to use the random-password feature for each one. Turns out $Colleague had changed his master password that day by coincidence, hence the warnings in the logs I saw.

I have now switched on a policy that prevents the master password being used elsewhere.

942,The Best (in my limited opinion) Sweet Older Lady,"So, I’m on mobile, and even off mobile, I’ve got issues with paragraph breaks and all. Immediate apology for bad formatting. Additional apologies for odd phrasing, it’s 5:30 AM here, and my brain’s basically turned off. I’m also not what you’d call a “professional” who “gets paid,” I’m just the most accessible nerd in a small, somewhat isolated, town, and I’m available Sunday mornings. As a result, I’ve become an informal tech support service for the nearby over 60 crowd. I also don’t fix big problems. I clean desktops, I set up digital cameras, I work out compatibility issues for crochet pattern programs, and fairly commonly, I deal with those intimidating IE popups that yell at you to call a number, because compooter got veerus.

But I quickly came to realize that one of these retirees was not like the others. Let’s call her Miss C. Miss C’s been around as long as any of her neighbors can remember. She’s a delight to be around, and she pays in muffins. An excellent deal. One day, she wakes me up at 6ish with a call.

Miss C: (Cap), it says the FBI thinks I’m in trouble, but I know it’s not the FBI. Can you come and fix it?
Me: Sure! Give me a minute.

She doesn’t do well on the phone, so I bike to her place, clear the popup (you could hear the synthesized voice whining about “HARD DRIVE OF PRZERONOGRAPHY” from the front door), and update a few things. This gradually turns into a three and a half hour problem solving spree: Driver updating, printer fixing, password updating, etc. During this, I realize that there are a few things about Miss C that just don’t quite add up. She’s remarkably tech literate, and only really has issues with more obscure things that you’d run into from messing with more advanced settings, as well as fairly new things, and things she forgets how to do. So, eventually it gets to a point where I’m reminding her about Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up the task manager, and she strikes up a conversation that makes everything fall into place.

Miss C: Oh! That still works?
Me: Yep. Your last computer did it, too.
Miss C: No, not that, back when I was a programmer...

Cue a thirty minute conversation, during which she reveals that she wrote custom programs for financial something or others in QBASIC and a number of other languages I can’t remember around 25 years ago, and wrote programs for her company’s UNIVAC mainframe for another 10 before that. Those dates might be wrong, my memory’s pretty trash for a few things.

The basic gist was that she started programming when it was seen strictly as a job for women, and hung on when the field began to make a drastic male dominated shift, simply because she was good, and she’d been around for a while. She was using more advanced settings the way she’d been using them for 15 years, and wasn’t quite sure how they’d changed, so she guessed a bit, and later forgot she altered the settings at all. After much googling, digging around, and eventually digging up of a bunch of photos she thought were lost, I left, rewarded with some stories of her own tech support headaches, and six fresh muffins.

More of a people heavy story than a tech heavy story, but I feel I should share it somewhere, and this is certainly a tale from tech support. When I’m dealing with someone who refuses to let me help them, or insists something’s “the computer’s fault” when I’m trying to fix a problem, or generally stalls or pushes me around, I like to think that there are more people like Miss C out there. It’s the ones like her that make the headaches worth it. Now, she likes to tell me about her old job while I help her out. She even dug up a couple old punch tapes she’d worked on, once.

Again, my apologies for any sketchy details or incorrect dates. I really struggle to remember details from conversations I have when I’m working on something. I took her age, and some general timeframes, and guesstimated the dates, but they seem about right.

Honestly? I really hope I meet more people like Miss C doing this. She’s the reason I get excited when my phone wakes me up.",False,329,27,CapMcCloud,talesfromtechsupport
943,I think the monitor is the most important part,"This was a while ago. It made me quite bitter really, and they ended up losing more money. 

My  relatives bought a new PC, really cheaply. It was a PC, with a monitor, keyboard, mouse etc... for about £80 all in

The desktop was worth about £180 alone at the time, and the monitor was worth about £35

The keyboard and mouse was worth about £15 or so. I checked eBay for previous prices

They them decided that they want to sell it, and asked me how much it'd go for. They also asked me to put it on eBay. These days I don't bother with buying any thing for them, as well it's so much hassle when they buy something they chose, and then decide they don't want it, and you have to pay to send it back..

Any way, I sold the monitor first. It went for about £35. It was reasonable. That's how much others sold for. For reference, I sold a similar monitor of mine two years prior to that, for about £50, so it's reasonable for the monitor to depreciate that amount

They then started to shout at me, and telling me why I sold it for that much, when they asked me to put it on eBay, and well the risk for them is that the market may pay less than they want, which was a reasonable price any way.

I then tell them but the desktop PC will sell for £180 easily. Cue an uncle who's never worked in IT shouting, saying"" I think that the monitor is the most important part. It's like the engine in a car. Come on u/b1tchlasagna, have some common sense. You should know this ""

I then try to tell them about how I log on to computers (I log on to networking devices primarily but they are fundamentally computers)  and I don't need a monitor, and that we have hundreds of servers in the data centre, not one which has it's own dedicated monitor.

Cue   You don't know any thing"" and me then refusing to sell any other part of it. I wasn't going to break it down in terms of parts, but in terms of selling the desktop, monitor, keyboard and mouse

On a side note, I hate the words ""common sense"" as in my experience, people who use that term typically think they know more than they actually do. Everyone has blind spots in their knowledge.

These proposals are usually put together by my supervisor, who functions as the Marketing Director (he was gone, so maybe he thought going down a rung was going to help?)

In the last few months, we've had a rash of phishing emails hitting the particular entity I provide support for. $GovOrg has been doing test emails to see who the worst offenders are (surprise about 16K people), and that seems to be curbing the amount of people in high positions giving away their AD credentials to random people in Pakistan/India (where most of the attacks seem to come from).


$GovOrg also implemented a new procedure for AD resets where we use $ADTool to generate a random password for the user containing random 8-10 character passwords. The account is then set to require the password be changed on the next login. It's also important to mention that $GovOrg has an SLA agreement with the company I actually work for that the average handle time be no more than 6 minutes for simple things like password resets. Anything  more complicated should be routed to an $OnSiteTech. As you can imagine, some certain end-users have difficulty entering simple passwords, so this has been a great point of consternation for many of us. As such, we used to give simple passwords like ""password123"" for the temporary ones.... Here is an average exchange.

947,You'd better behave...,"LTL, FTP.  This happened the other day and gave me a bit of a chuckle.  I was hoping it might give a few of you a smile too.

Characters:
Me : yours truly.
Mom: the better half of yours truly
K: our 8 year old daughter

For this to make sense, a little background on me is necessary.  I spent a decade or so doing tech support to pay my way through college.  I started as your bright eyed T1 script monkey.  With a bit of hard work and some luck I slowly progressed my way up to the grumpy guy in the corner that the T3 techs would cautiously approach and go “Hey, I know we’re not supposed to bother you unless it is an emergency, but something really weird is happening…”.  I call this time the dark ages - not because I hated tech support - I enjoyed it a lot.  But the stress of working and going to school full time while slowly having my faith in humanity sucked from me one phone call at a time left a pretty lasting impression on me.

As such, my family knows two basic facts when it comes to me and computers.  First, I can fix just about any problem they might encounter in day to day life.  Second, I’m not tech support.  I’ll fix it - but I want them to at least have tried themselves first.

So when my daughter walked up to me and said “Dad, your computer is broken”, she probably wasn’t that surprised when she was met with nothing but a blank stare.

&gt; [K] (channeling her inner teenager and rolling her eyes): ugh - fine.  The screen is flashing off and on.  I’ve tried restarting it.  There is no error message because it just goes off and on.  And mom said this was a Dad problem already so I can’t ask her.

I was actually intrigued at this point.

&gt; [Me] Ok, come show me what is going on.

At this point, we went up to my office and I grabbed my chain and watched for about 10 minutes while my daughter tried to replicate the problem.  My wife was there working along on her computer as well so we chatted a bit.  Of course nothing happened.  I finally got a bit bored and stood to leave.

&gt; [K] It was broken!  I swear it was.   The screen would go off and back on.  I don’t know why it isn’t doing it now.

&gt; [Mom] It is your Dad.  Computers are afraid of him.  They don’t dare misbehave while he is in the room.

At this point my daughter grabbed my chair and moved it back in front of the computer and sat down.  She likes to use my chair, but her feet down quite hit the floor so she was swinging them back and forth.  I remembered that I had been messing with the DVI cables that run from my KVM earlier and hadn’t tightened them down.  I theorized she might be kicking the cable - not enough to push it out, but just enough to cause a loose connection to make it flicker.  My daughter sat down and looked at my wife skeptically and said:

&gt; [K] That isn’t true is it Dad?

 I figured I could play along, so I walked to the tower and pointed my finger at the case and said:

&gt; [Me] You’d better behave.  You don’t want me coming back in here.  Understand?

I then nudged it closer to the wall with my foot so the cable couldn’t wiggle free.  I figured I’d get a screwdriver and properly tighten things up in a bit (my fingers don’t really fit those screws well any more). 

With that, I left and went to grab a screwdriver.  Along the way I was distracted by something else and forgot all about the loose screws.  However she didn’t come back complaining about the problem so I assumed everything was working.

The next day after I picked my daughter up from school I asked if her report was done.  She said it was almost done but had just a little bit left.  We started to head upstairs so I could log her onto my computer.  At that point I saw the screwdriver I’d set on the counter the night before and remembered the loose cable.  I walked over to grab it while she continued upstairs to the office.

I was just walking around the corner to the office when I saw her standing there staring at the machine with her hands on her hips.  In the most serious voice I’ve ever heard her use she then pointed her finger at the computer and proceeded to say:

&gt; [K] You’d better behave or I’ll go get Dad!

For the record when I stopped laughing I did explain what I thought the actual problem was and taught her how to tighten the screws on the DVI cables.  But it gave me a good laugh.

Hello TFTS. I work tech support at an electronics store, so we see a lot of people with pretty conventional problems - viruses, OS reinstalls, parts just dying out of spite, etc.

So I'm behind the desk, moving some updating laptops into the overnight cage in preparation to go home when an old woman walks up and asks for help pairing her new headset with her phone. Takes about fifteen seconds to do so, and I walk her through the buttons. This takes a while, but I'm happy to do it, do unto others and all that. She seems to get it, so I check up on something for a minute to wait out the last bit of my shift. And that's when things get difficult.

$customer: Excuse me, can you help? It stopped working. I cannot hear him [the guy in the YouTube video she was watching].

$me: Alright, let's take a look. 

Bluetooth is on, headset switch is in the on position, volume isn't zero... Wait. No LED blink on the headset. Turn it off, wait a moment, no confirmation vibration. Turn it on again, wait, yes. Alrighty, it's working again. Check the BT connection, it's good, play the video and it's all working nicely. She says I must be very intelligent, thanks me, and I take my leave and check on some paperwork. A little bit longer...

$customer waves me over again.

$customer: I cannot hear him. It is not working.

So I go through the process again, but stay and watch for a moment after to see what the issue is. It turns out that she turns the headset off and on with one quick motion, which keeps the headset from booting properly. So I respectfully explain that she needs to be patient and wait for the vibration.

$customer: Oh, okay. So I turn it off and on? [Proceeds to do it too fast again]

$me: No, it needs a moment to start up and it'll tell you. [Demonstrates]

$customer: Oh, okay, I have to wait.

She starts listening to her video again (why she did this at the desk I'll never know). I glance at my watch, and it's time to flee the building! Yaaaay! I gather my things, start making my way to the exit-

$customer waves me over

Despair grips my soul. 

$customer: I cannot hear him. Can you hear him? [Shoves headset at my face]

$me: Uhh-

$customer: Wait, he is speaking French. I'll find an English video for you.

She then pulls up a video (in English) about one of the aspects of the Buddha in Chinese culture... Which isn't one of my typical troubleshooting steps, to say the least. 

$customer: Can you hear him?

So I listen, and no, I can't. I skip the troubleshooting and restart the headset properly. Surprise surprise, it's fixed.

$me, frustrated and anxious to leave but still respectful: When you turn it off, you need to wait ten seconds or it won't work.

$customer: Oh, okay. I need to count ten seconds.

So she waits ten seconds, and **then** flicks the switch in the exact way I've been trying to stop.

949,Why am I even an IT for your company?,"So this literally just happened now and I'm still steaming after getting back from a meeting with the boss.

Some guy from ISP A came over selling their internet \+ phone package to our company. Definitely way better than what ISP B currently gives us. 10x the speed, cheaper phone lines, retain the same numbers, and and direct rather than VoIP, and we save 30$ or something per month, which is pretty big for a small business.

Boss asks me about the VoIP to direct, asking how the current system is. See, a few months back, the Modem/Router combo that ISP B gave us died on us and the internet and phone lines were out of commission. Internet was easily fixed by using the company cellphone as a hotspot, but the phones were really dead, and customer support was being a bitch.  

So ISP A is offering direct, meaning that if the modem/router dies, it doesn't necessarily mean that the phones will be dead too.  I explain it to my boss how it works and the conversation went something like this:

Boss: So what makes ISP B's phone line different?

Me: If the modem/router dies, the phone won't. 

Boss: Wasn't it always like that?

Me: No, cuz it was connected to the same box. So if your modem/router goes down, your phones are down too. 

*\-and here comes the clincher\-*

Boss: **I don't think so.** 

...

So boss asks the other employees who are non\-IT and they agree with me saying that that's how the system works, AND BOSS BELIEVES THEM!

It's ALWAYS been like this too. Even when the modem/router was down before. I told her the modem/router box is dead cuz no wifi signal, etc etc. Boss just says ""No you just misplugged something or maybe didn't set an option right"" and in my mind I'm just like ""BITCH I TOOK A PHOTO BEFORE I UNPLUGGED ANYTHING. IT'S ALL THE SAME.""

&gt;Me: Wait, what? 

  
**WHAM**  


&gt;Me: Wow, nice underside this bus has. What am I being volunteered for?  
&gt;$SalesDrone: Go talk to $customer, he needs $software updated.
  
(NOTE: $customer is a huge company, mumble-hundred-million annual revenue. Huge. Also, I've never heard of $software before.)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;$customer: So yeah, we need $software updated in our production environment, it's currently at version D and the latest version is J, and we need it to be at the latest version...  
&gt;Me: *(having frantically inhaled an un-digestable chunk of $software documentation in the past hour)* Okay, so tell me a little bit about your environment.  
&gt;$customer: Well, as you know, the software is in a client-server configuration. The server runs on $SquinkyUX version A.3...  
&gt;ME: ....  
*($SquinkyUX is a well-known Unixoid OS, but version A.3 has gone EOS -- not End of Life, End of Support -- 7 years ago.)*  
&gt;$customer: ... and the clients are a mixture of SquinkyUX and $Portholes version Bk.   
&gt;Me: *briefly speechless* I'm sorry, did you say version Bk? The one that came out 15 years ago? THAT version Bk?  
&gt;$customer: Yup.  
&gt;Me: Okay. This is going to be a bigger job than I thought. The problem is that there is no direct upgrade path from D to J, we're going to need to go D -&gt; E -&gt;F, etcetera. And the very first upgrade to E will necessitate a migration for the clients, since they can't handle those OS levels -- *because you are running mission-critical applications on blonking ancient infrastructure, you blonking muppet -- no, wait, can't say that* -- so we're going to need to set up a test environment in parallel...  
&gt;$customer: No.  
&gt;Me: Wait, what?  
&gt;$customer: We are not updating the hardware or the OS.   
&gt;Me: Oookay, then. I am not sure what we can...  
&gt;$customer: Why can't you just install version J of the server on a new VM and have it talk to the old clients?  
&gt;Me: Because it won't work. They completely redesigned the database accesses between version F and version G...  
&gt;$customer: But what if it does work?  
&gt;Me: Er. It won't.

&gt;$customer: But what if it does work?  
&gt;Me: It won't.  
&gt;$customer: But on the off-chance it does work? I want you to do it.  
&gt;Me: Sir. You are the customer, and I will do my best to accede to your wishes, but I want it very clearly understood that You. Are. Wasting. Your. Money.   
&gt;$customer: Yeah, whatever. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, off I go. 
&gt;$customer: Here, spin up the server on $LinuxWavyHat.

&gt;Me: That won't work. $software is only compatible with $LinuxDeadRat.

&gt;$customer: But they're completely identical. 

&gt;Me: First of all, there are very minor differences. And secondly, if I encounter any issues, the first question $software_vendor is going to ask is ""what OS are you running"". And if I say ""$LinuxWavyHat"" they will tell me to go pound sand.  

&gt;$customer: Well, maybe they won't...   

&amp;nbsp;

To make a long story short -- too late -- $ratticus spends 3 days fighting to install $software on $LinuxWavyHat. $ratticus runs into problems. $ratticus is told to go pound sand by $vendor. $ratticus finally convinces $customer to let him try $LinuxDeadRat, spends 2 more days fighting, and finally gets the server installed.  
Can the server talk to the clients? Of COURSE not.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I've got the bit in my teeth. I've spent a week on this stupid project. I come up with the idea of bypassing some of the server functionality and passing the data to the clients using SSH/SCP rather than the server's built-in data transfer routines. It's a Lovecraftian kludge, but it ought to work.  

Server to SquinkyUX works like a charm.  However, no matter how much time I spend digging, I cannot find a version of SSH that works on $Portholes Bk.

&gt;Me: I tried. It doesn't work. Here's your bill.

&gt;$customer: **grumble** **mumble** waste of money **mumble** *signs bill*

951,This is my life. YOU MUST GRANT ACCESS!,"One of my current job functions is helping to manage the proxy servers, including adding exceptions if say a client's website is registering a false positive and is being blocked. Whenever users are in the web browser, if a page is blocked there's a link to a form to request proxy access to the URL, and of course there's room for a business reason/justification. Most of the time, these are websites for new customers that may have a low reputation since they are new, and again we'll often grant access if it's truly another business being blocked.

Once in a while, though, we get some real gems, including the usual ""I need this YouTube access for learning,"" in which case we may grant access to individual videos if it's legitimate training. Yesterday, I received my favorite proxy request and I have considered printing out the email and framing it on my cube, and this is actually the second request from this user so let's start from the first request:

&gt; Business reason: JW.tv and JW.org- is my religious institute. I use the platform to enhance my theocratic studies and for moral stability. It is not for entertainment. This is my way of life.

We send out the email that this request is denied because it is not business related. My current employer does have a strict policy on what is accessed on the network, nobody said you can't watch it on your phone since users don't get the company Wi-Fi either. Our response:

&gt; $IT: Due to corporate policy, this request has been denied. Proxy exceptions must be business related, and the business reason listed does not match our policies and standards. Thank you.

A month later, we received what is my favorite proxy request to date, and it's even more satisfying because we simply copy and pasted our generic response to it, but...well you'll see:

&gt; Business reason: This is my religion, my life.  I LOOK ON THIS SITE FOR MORAL STABILITY. NOT FOR PLEASURE. YOU CAN LOOK AT IT. IT WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU HAVE IN LIFE.

952,"Password Recovery in the Land of “Oh, that’s broken too…”","Hey everyone, LTL/FTP, all that good stuff, please be gentle. Strap in, because this is a long one.

I do Linux sysadmin-y and support stuff as my main job (with a dash of networking thrown in). Vagueness for job security. I also do one-on-one tech support with personal clients as a side gig I started while still in college. Most of these clients are older and pretty well off. This invariably means iDevices. They aren’t my favourite, but I can fix anything and I’ve learned to work with them. (I do own an iPhone… They got me with the iPod back in the day, what can I say? This is relevant later.)

I hadn’t heard from one of my clients in a few years. Not a big deal, it happens. I also know what it means when that kind of client gives me a call out of the blue. They’ve broken everything they own, and they’re in a panic. Last week was no exception.

For this scene, we have yours truly, **CC**, and **Sweet Older Lady (SOL)**.

*phone rings, client name pops up*

&gt;**CC**: “Hello, this is CC. How can I help you?”  
&gt;**SOL**: “Hi, this is SOL. I don’t know if you remember me… *some generalities about our last appointment three years ago*”  
&gt;**CC**: “Yes, of course. It’s nice to hear from you again.”  
&gt;**SOL**: “So, I’ve got this problem… My laptop keeps asking me for my password, and it’s getting in the way of my work. It’s really annoying. Can you fix it?”

I ponder for a second. Her phrasing is interesting. If it’s in the way of her work, but not stopping her…

&gt;**CC**: “So, you can use your computer, but there’s a ‘box’ asking you for a password while you’re working?”  
&gt;**SOL**: “Yes, that’s right.”  
&gt;**CC**: “Is this for your iCloud password?”  
&gt;**SOL**: “I think so, though I’m not sure. I’ve tried putting that one in, but it says it’s wrong. But the box keeps popping up and if I click Later, it just comes back!”

Yup, definitely the macOS iCloud dialog box. She’s forgotten her password.

&gt;**CC**: “Okay, that’s fine. We can just reset it.”  
&gt;**SOL**: “I’ve tried. But it never works.”

I figured.

&gt;**CC**: “You have an iPhone as well, correct?”  
&gt;**SOL**: “Yes, I do.”  
&gt;**CC**: “Great. We can use that to recover your password.”

I knew this, as I’d been the one to set this all up three years ago. We agree on an appointment time two days later.

~ Two Days Later ~

I arrive at her house. I’d tried to call ahead to confirm earlier in the day, but hadn’t heard back. (This is also relevant later). A little strange, but she was just getting off work so I didn’t think too much of it. I knock on the door. Thankfully she’s there and lets me in. I get set up on her kitchen table with her laptop. It loads up, asks for her password to login.

&gt;**CC**: “Can you enter your password, please?”  
&gt;**SOL**: “Oh, sure. One second.”

She gets out the Small Pad of Passwords, which is a universal smart-but-not-great-with-tech thing. I find it adorable. I get logged in, and the first thing I see is the system asking for the Keychain password, which she enters. Then the iCloud password dialog comes up.

&gt;**SOL**: “See?”

She hits ‘Later’ before I can say anything. It comes back in two seconds. And I know exactly what’s happened.

For the uninitiated/sane, the macOS Keychain is the program that stores saved passwords (among other things). For ease of use, it’s locked using the same password as the user’s login password. When that user logs in, the system uses that to ‘unlock the keychain’, granting access to those stored passwords. The only times the system should ask the user to unlock this keychain itself are if a user has gone in and changed the keychain password manually (far beyond the technical level of typical users), or they’ve been locked out of their computer and changed their password to get back in using unusual means.

Shorter explanation: General password f***ery.

&gt;**CC**: “Okay, I see what you mean. Let’s reset your password and get you going.”

I go through a few screens, and asked to verify my identity using one of a few options. I choose the “send a text to verified number on account” option, as I can guess that she’s not logged into iCloud on any of her other devices and we can’t use that.

&gt;**CC**: “Great. You should receive a text on your iPhone in a few seconds with a code. May I see it?”

She looks startled.

Uh oh.

&gt;**SOL**: “I’m afraid my cell phone stopped working yesterday afternoon. It’s why I didn’t call you to confirm our appointment. I only had your number saved there.”

**Uh oh.**

&gt;**CC**: “That’s alright. Let me take a look at it and see if we can get you up and running again.”

She hands me her phone. It’s off. I turn it on. The “connect to iTunes (I’m in Recovery mode, shhh)” graphic pops up.

***Uh oh***.

&gt;**CC**: “Um. Tell me what exactly happened when this started.”  
&gt;**SOL**: “I kept getting this popup asking if I wanted to update. I hit no like I always do, but I guess I hit the wrong button this time? It started downloading and it was taking *forever*, so my friend suggested I turn the phone off. I did, and then that happened. It won’t turn on again.”

ಠ_ಠ

My internal sigh is heard around the world, and every tech support worker unconsciously shivers.

I don my extremely patient, professional voice.

&gt;**CC**: “Okay, I think I know what happened. iPhones are pretty tough (lies) and about the only thing you can do to break them is if you turn if off during an update (bigger lies). Please don’t do that.”  
&gt;**SOL**: “I guess that was pretty silly of me. I won’t do that again.”  
&gt;**CC**: “That’s alright. We can use your laptop to download the phone update and install in on your phone.”

I plug her phone in. iTunes pops up asking if I’d like to update or recover the phone to factory. Update. Would I like to download the software? Yes.

Error. This version of iTunes is too friggin' old.

Okay. Let’s go update iTunes.

Open up the App Store, go to Updates, hit Update on the iTunes listing.

**Enter iCloud password.**

**ಠ_ಠ**

&gt;**CC**: “Looks like your computer hasn’t been updated in a while *(see definition: THREE YEARS)*, and I can’t download the phone software without updating it… And I can’t update it until we fix your password. But that’s alright, I can use my own laptop. Can I get your WiFi password?”

I get logged in, plug her phone into my computer, and start the download.

**Estimated Download Time: 2.5 hours**

***ಠ_ಠ***

Check WiFi signal strength. It’s high. Run a speedtest. It’s very, VERY slow, but matches what I recognize as the lowest speed tier of *MajorCanadianISP*.

&gt;**CC**: “Unfortunately, it looks like you have a very slow internet connection, and the phone software is quite large. It’ll take over two hours to download. I’ll have to set it to download and come back at a later date.”  
&gt;**SOL**: “Oh, I see. Alright. Well, what about the password thing?”  
&gt;**CC**: “Let me see if we can go about that another way.”  

I run through the dialog again, and choose the e-mail option. I ask her to check. She doesn’t receive it. Ten minutes pass. I double-check the e-mail address listed (again) with her.

&gt;**SOL**: “Oh! Sorry, that’s my old e-mail address. I don’t use it anymore. My new one is *oldemailaddress* with a 2 at the end.”  
&gt;**CC**: “I see. Why did you change it?”  
&gt;**SOL**: “I couldn’t remember the password.”

Just... ***ಠ_ಠ!***

&gt;**CC**: “Well, I can’t use your e-mail, then.”  
&gt;**SOL**: “Can’t you just change the e-mail address?”  
&gt;**CC**: “I’d need your correct password for that.”  
&gt;**SOL**: “Oh.”

At this point, she’s feeling very bad, as she can see how badly she’s messed up. I’m feeling bad for her and get determined, so I put my Creative Hat (tm) on.

&gt;**CC**: “Well, let me try one more thing. Do you have a paperclip?”

I remove her SIM card and put it into my own iPhone. I receive a few texts meant for her that were still in queue, but none of them are from Apple. I go through the password recovery screens once again, choose SMS once again, and wait. Nothing.

&gt;**CC**: “I’m sorry, this isn’t working. *MajorCanadianCarrier* isn’t exactly known for the best service. I’ll need to come back once the software has downloaded.”  
&gt;**SOL**: *crestfallen* Okay.

And that’s how SOL earned her name. There wasn’t a single thing I could do at that point, couldn't even call Apple Support as they were closed. I charge by the hour, and it didn’t make sense for me to sit around waiting for the download when I literally couldn’t do anything else until it was done. So, we set up another appointment. We leave her laptop on to download the software. She pays me for my time.

Total time spent: 2 hours.

I go home and download the same software in less than a minute, as I don’t trust her connection. I come back a few days later, flash her phone, use it to recover her password, log her in to all her devices, update them and get her running again in under an hour. And she writes down her shiny new password in her Small Pad of Passwords.

And that’s the tale of how I got paid three hours for a (less than) one hour job. SOL apologized profusely for waiting so long to contact me, and has already set up her next appointment with a long list of things she’d like to do.

953,"Tom, Jerry, and a Box of Lucky Charms","So it's been a long time since I've posted from this account, but since I've told this story to a few people who are trying to find my main account on this subreddit for a prize I need to ditch my main. 

This is the story about a possessed computer that had me taken for a ride for most of the week. 

I got a ticket and an email late Tuesday afternoon about a computer in one of our manufacturing rooms that experienced ODBC errors in the program, and on reboot the ""mouse went berserk"" 

Now with our application, an ODBC error occurs when the application loses connection to the server most often than not caused by a network error in which a reboot of the PC and check or wipe down of the ethernet cable (alcohol rag on the termination end) will fix. The technician and tech lead for the area did just this (I have trained them well) and the computer came back up online. With one major issue. 

They submitted a ticket including the ODBC error as well as ""on reboot the mouse went berserk, and we could not control it to reboot the PC again"" I called the tech up in the morning to ask what went wrong. She explained it was as if the mouse was being controlled remotely. It was right clicking on its own, moving around the screen sporadically, ""drawing boxes"" aka click and drag on the desktop, and all around could not be controlled. 

They unplugged the USB mouse, even tried the touch screen and nothing would stop this mouse pointer from its possessed rage. They eventually unplugged the computer and on power restore it was working perfectly. 

We agreed if this happened again, take a video on your phone and let me know as soon as possible, even let it go and let me VNC in and watch or drive in to see in person. 

Now being the Sherlock Holmes that I am could not let this go. I grabbed every log I could think of off the machine, application log and all 5 event viewer hives for investigation. 

Over the course of the week I made it a point to dedicate an hour or so every day to read these logs and figure out what happened. 

Nothing. No VNC connections (we were all off shift), no remote connections/assistance, no other users logging in, nothing as much as a driver failure on the USB driver or touch screen malfunction. 

I all but gave up until today. Watching the clock on a Friday ready to bail as soon as the second hand hit the 12 on 5, I finally discovered what I could only describe as a ""Lightbulb!"" moment.

SerMouse. 

On the production PCs we have a series of COM ports opened on a serial adapter box for the scales, as that's the only way we can get them to talk to our application. On reboot after the ODBC error, Windows decided ""Hey, we see a serial port, that must be a mouse!"" and loaded the SerMouse driver to connect to the first available scale. At this point, Windows had no idea what to do with the serial output of an analytical manufacturing scale (measures fractions of a gram and prone to ambient air movement if the case isn't closed) and the mouse pointer went absolutely insane. 

I still don't know why this happened on the reboot, as I haven't seen this issue since the 2000/NT age, even a few times on XP but never on a 7 box. 

I immediately emailed the tech lead back explaining this long history of mice, microsoft, and serial connections and how they thwarted the IT guy for days until it finally clicked. I got an email and call back thanking me for the explanation (Weird right?) and how interesting it was. 

I guess Monday is an update to the installation of the application for production machines and the regedit fix of stopping SerMouse 

For anyone interested: 

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\sermouse &gt; Start &gt; set value to '4'

**TL;DR: Windows thought a serial connected scale was a mouse, mouse pointer had a demonic episode, IT guy couldn't catch it for days**

954,What do you take me for?,"LTL, FTP, also I think we all experienced a similar story, anyway, here it goes.

This story happended more than a decade ago. I was a training as a tech monkey, part of my training was being a T2 Supporter. Our training group was responsible for a few hundered outdated workstations and between 100 and 200 even more outdated printers, mostly HP LaserJets and DeskJets.

One merry day, when I was doing T1 support besides T2 support for a week or two, a buddy of another department called in, I took his call by pure chance.

&gt; *$Me*: Good day, this is mokawede for IT Service, how may I help you today?

&gt; *$Me*: Hey, *$Buddy*, yeah, it's me. What can I do for you?

&gt; *$Buddy*: Yeah, we have a problem with our printer, it's broken.

&gt; *$Me*: All right, what does it not do?

&gt; *$Buddy*: It doesn't turn on.

&gt; *$Me*: Did you press the power switch? Not the one top, but on the side of the printer?

&gt; *$Buddy*: Yes of course I did that.

&gt; *$Me*: Did you check the power cable, is it loose maybe?

&gt; *$Buddy*: Of course I did, what do you take me for?

&gt; *$Me*: Sorry, I have to make sure, you know how it is.

&gt; *$Me*: I'll be over in the next five minutes, will you be there then?

&gt; *$Buddy*: Yeah, sure.

So printed out the ticket sheet (Yeah, we had to print the ticket onto a form, where we would write down what we did by hand. Closing a ticket meant copying everything back into the ticket system, which was a ... thing that someone clicked togehter using MS Access '97. That was so fun.), grabbed a cart and headed over to $Buddys office, internally preparing to solder some capacitors onto some pcb out of an old, dusty LaserJet 3 or 4 or 5 the next day.

&gt; *$Me*: Hey there, where's that darned thing?

&gt; *$Buddy*: This one.

The first thing I check is the power button, then I wobbled the cable a bit, tried again, and of course it did nothing. $Buddy glared at me.

&gt; *$Me*: Sorry, standard procedure.

So I unplugged the cables, loaded the printer onto the cart, went to get the power cable and found it hadn't been plugged into the outlet. So, I plugged it into the outlet, plugged the other end into the printer, and would you look at that: It's alive, enriching the air of the office space with it's odor of hot dust!

I looked at $Buddy.

$Buddy looked away.

I put the printer where it belonged, wrote down ""Plugged the power cable into the outlet"" onto my ticket sheet, got *$Buddy*s signature and left. We didn't talk for a week or so. He apologized later.

Backstory, aka *Too Short, Need More to Read*:
A coworker was working in the data center, and noticed a drive was dead on a server.  He didn't recognize the server name, was working a more urgent problem, and asked me to create a ticket to have a Field Engineer from the vendor replace the drive.  Hey, I type fast, it'll take two minutes, tops, right?

I had to do a little digital archeology, but by searching old incidents find the server's real name, and that it is an appliance used by another team.

I create the ticket and **start** the description with ""Server Team does not support or have access to this server.  Contact XYZ Service Owner Joe Blow for support and access"".  Our tickets have a ""Submitted By"" and ""On Behalf of"" field; I set the latter to ""Joe Blow, XYZ Service Owner"".

So what happens 20 minutes later?  

&gt; Help Desk IM:  I see your ticket, when we contact the vendor, can you escort the FE onsite?

&gt; Me:  No, as the ticket says, ""Server Team does not support or have access to this server.  Contact XYZ Service Owner Joe Blow for support and access"".  Also, that data center is two states away.

&gt; Help Desk: Oh, ok.

&gt; Coworker at the data center:  I can't login to this server, do you have access?

&gt; Me:  No, as the ticket says, it's owned by XYZ.  We shouldn't be touching this ticket, I sent it to hardware to get an FE out.

958,Let's perform a system update in an airport,"Had a customer bring in an Apple laptop today.

They had been putting off updating their OS to High Sierra for a few months and they were waiting at the airport to get on a flight. So they decided to download and install the update over the airport's free WiFi.

With that news all the staff who overheard gave a collective wince. Full system updates are a delicate task at the best of times, but downloading it over a free airport hotspot... not a good idea.

The update had apparently downloaded fine and the system had restarted to apply the update. The amount of time they must have spent downloading a 2-3GB update must have been a long layover, but if it downloaded fine, there might have been hope.

But then they got the call for their flight and instead of closing the unit and putting into sleep, which may have been ok, they powered it off with the power button.

Now that would be bad at the best of times, however the latest macOS has a new file system for flash storage, of which all current laptops have. Updating to that new OS means that the whole partition has to be converted from the previous file system to the new one. This apparently happens at the same time as the new system files are written as well, which is why the laptop fails to boot after updating 1 in 10 even at the best of times.

After explaining why each of her decisions probably wasn't the best choice. Thankfully she was happy enough to book it in so we can take a look at whether any information is going to be recoverable, then fix the thing. Unfortunately half failed updates need reformatting the partition if it's caught halfway in one file system and half in the other, so I'm not looking forward to the results.",False,2126,194,Cgdoosi,talesfromtechsupport

962,An angry professor and his coffee-damaged laptop gave me enlightenment (and laughs),"**Me**:  The green and keen PFY (jr. sysadmin/support person) in the Computer Science dept. at a large state university, a couple decades ago.  My first real job!

**Prof**: The one rude and surly professor in a department otherwise full of wonderful people.  Ph. D. in computer science, but known for printing out his emails before reading them.  Had two moods: yelling, and yelling loudly.

**Boss**: Sr. sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.  Unflappably polite, but also didn't take crap from Prof.

**Scene**: The CS lab.  I was hard at work on something or other when Prof burst in.  (He never just entered quietly.  He always burst in without any pleasantries and left with a &lt;SLAM&gt; of the door.)

Boss was respectful to Prof, but didn't take crap from him.  So naturally when Prof wanted to yell and badger at someone, I, being the PFY, was an easier target.  This particular incident occurred about a week after he had used some grant money to buy the fanciest, most expensive laptop anyone in the department had ever seen, which he used for the arduous tasks of running notepad and printing emails.

&gt; Prof, yelling: This laptop is broken.  I demand that you fix it immediately.

&gt; Me: Hmmm...  Let me take a look....  Looks like you spilled coffee all over the keyboard.

&gt; Prof, yelling LOUDLY: That is a ridiculous accusation!  I resent that!  I never drink coffee near the laptop!  I'm a professor.  Don't talk to me like that!  I'm telling Boss how rude you were.

I wasn't super worried.  Boss knew this guy.  And how often his printed-out emails had coffee stains on them.  I looked closer and, before thinking, blurted out -

&gt; Me: ... and cream, it would seem?

Prof finds Boss, calls him over, and angrily escalates to Boss in my presence.

&gt; Prof: ... and so I demand you fix it immediately.

&gt; Boss: It doesn't even power up.  We can't fix that.  It'll have to go back to Gateway.

&gt; Prof: It's under warranty.  Make them fix it!

Boss lets him dig the hole nice and deep.

&gt; Boss: Warranty won't cover a coffee spill.

&gt; Prof: IT WASN'T A COFFEE SPILL!  I DEMAND A WARRANTY REPAIR! IMMEDIATELY! AND WE WON'T PAY ONE CENT FOR IT!  &lt;SLAM&gt;

Exit prof.  Now I am a green and keen PFY.  What would Lassie do now?

&gt; Me: What on earth do we do here?

Boss gets a sly smile.

&gt; Boss: Ship it in for a warranty repair like he asked.

&gt; Me: But won't they just reject it?

&gt; Boss: Of course.

&gt; Me: But....   ooohhhhhhhh!

Boss's smile deepens.

&gt; Boss: And make sure to document for them that we refuse to pay even one cent for repair, just as Prof said.

And so begins my enlightenment.

Off goes the laptop.  Prof stops by every day for the next week or two, asking if the laptop's back, if we've heard anything, etc.  I'm sure the pain of having to print his email from a mere *average* computer was really getting to him.

Finally we get a package back from Gateway.  I was about to open it, but boss says no.  He calls up Prof to tell him his laptop is back.  Prof, of course, rushes over immediately.

&gt; Prof: &lt;bursts in&gt;  So it's back?  Does it work?

&gt; Boss: Here it is.  We haven't opened it yet.

Prof almost looks excited as he opens the box.  There's the laptop, with a repair order on top, reading:

&gt; Warranty claim denied

&gt; Rejection reason: System board damaged by dried brown and white liquid and smells of burnt coffee.

It also, to add ~~insult to injury~~hilarity, included a bill for the return shipping fee.

Prof stood there staring.  He literally got red in the face.  He yelled some more.  Loudly.  Boss and I just sat there, trying hard not to grin too obviously.  Finally:

&gt; Prof: Well how do I get it fixed then?

&gt; Boss: Pay for the repair.

&gt; Prof: Oh all right then, send it back.

Prof then looked at each of us intently, in an almost threatening manner.

963,"""We’re going to test the Hydrazine""","Years ago I was working as an IT contractor doing desk side support for a large jet fighter manufacturer and one of my assigned areas was the outlying hangars. Had an issue that I couldn’t resolve remotely so I grabbed a golf cart and headed out. This particular computer was the only one against the wall out in the hangar itself, while there were two or three others inside a small attached office. Got to work on the system and by the time I was sure I was only a few minutes away from a fix, the crew had begun preparing to run an engine test on a new jet that was about 12 feet / 3.5 meters or so behind me. I could hear them getting busy so I started to hurry. I knew that thing was going to be loud! Engine fired up but I pressed on. As it got louder I eventually ended up squeezing my right ear into my shoulder so I could still use my right hand while pressing my left palm against my left ear. It was deafening and I’m sure I looked ridiculous. Before it started, I could see the entire crew had moved into the attached office wearing their ear protection and by the time it was at full volume, they were even pressing the earmuffs against their heads it was so loud. During the first lull, a crew member took pity on me and brought me some hearing protection which I greatly appreciated. The engine eventually powered down and I pulled off my earmuffs and tried to wrap up. A minute or two later, the nice guy who loaned me the ear protection walked up and said, “Here in a minute, we’re going to test the Hydrazine”. Being an IT guy and not knowing the first thing about aircraft, I came back with, “Oh great. So how loud is that going to be?” He replied, “If you’re sitting here when we do that, it’ll kill you.” Can’t imagine the look I had on my face but I told him that the machine wasn’t fixed yet but I’d be back to take care of it later.",False,391,68,crinkletart,talesfromtechsupport
964,doubles trouble,"So, in its heyday, Singer made a lot of machines. A LOT a lot. They issued [serial numbers](http://ismacs.net/singer_sewing_machine_company/serial-numbers/singer-sewing-machine-serial-number-database.html) in batch lots of 10,000-15,000~, every six weeks. There were frequently only a few models in production at any one time, especially in the early days, and some of those models stayed in production for decades. The [decal sets](http://ismacs.net/singer_sewing_machine_company/decals/domestic-decals.html) changed over the years, but the mechanics are identical (except in a few models where they added a reverse) from beginning to end.

That means it's not unusual for me to have two or more of the same machine in at once. I'm anal about paperwork, and that includes the check-in tags; there's space for name/contact info, make/model/serial number, plus intake notes. My tags are numbered; the claim check goes with the customer, second tear-off tag goes on the case or table if they brought one, name/model number/tag number goes on the parts bin, and the main tag stays with the machine head. I have *never*, in the years I've been doing this, gotten machines mixed up and given the wrong machine to the wrong person.

But Mr Ellison sure thought I had.

I currently have four Singer 66s in the shop-two are mine, two belong to customers. Two of those-one mine, one a customer's-have red eye decals. The other two have variations of plain gold decals-similar to, but *different* from each other. Last week I had five; those four, plus Mr Ellison's, which also had yet another similar-but-different plain gold decal set.

This all started several weeks ago, when Mr Ellison brought in an absolutely filthy 66. It had apparently been sitting in his garage, for ""at least"" 40 years, without a case. Dirty doesn't begin to describe it. But it was in pretty good condition under the grime, and he wanted to give it to his daughter in good working order, so I checked it in for a full refurbishing. Part of this process is cleaning up the finish as best I can. Singer used varnish over the decals, so sometimes there's just not a lot I can do, (although if you're adventurous, there are ways) but often, a good cleaning does a world of good. Once I'd gotten most of the dirt off, I oiled the hell out of the finish. Pour it on, let it soak, hit the ugly spots gently with a toothbrush, wipe off, repeat. The end result is a clean, shiny, bright black and gold sewing machine.

It began innocuously enough. Mr Ellison came to pick up his machine and said, ""Wow! Are you sure that's mine?"" *laughs* ""It doesn't look anything like the one I brought in!"" I assured him that it was indeed his, gave him a brief rundown of my tag tracking, explained the cleaning process, and continued on. He paid me, left, then called me the next day. ""Are you *sure* this is mine?"" Yes, Mr Ellison, I'm sure. He had the tear-off carbon copy receipt from the tag (I keep the other half), so I read him the serial number on my half (which matched his half) and encouraged him to go ahead and double check with the machine. He said he would.

What he did was spend the weekend stewing about it. When I came up to the shop Monday afternoon, he was waiting for me, his machine on he floor by the door. ""Now, I'm not accusing you of anything-mistakes do just happen. But I think you made one, and you gave me the wrong machine back. I'd like to get it straightened out."" In the end, I had to line up all five machines on the triage table and go over them, one by one, serial number by serial number, my half of the tag-with his signature on it!-to prove that the machine he took home was the machine he brought in. He still clearly only half believed me. ""Are there more than one set of numbers on the machines you could have gotten mixed up?"" No, Mr Ellison, it's not like a VIN on a car, where the numbers are everywhere. That one brass plate is it. ""Well, if you say so. It sure doesn't look like mine, but I can't figure out how it can't be after all this. I guess maybe it was dirtier than I thought. I just knew it was black and gold.""

He did finally take his machine back home. But I'd bet he *still* doesn't believe it's really his.

After the duty nurse confirmed that the day had indeed arrived, we were moved from the observation room to one of the delivery rooms along with a pair of nurses who were assigned to look after mom and the baby (and dad too!).

The new room had a workstation that had an issue. It did not want to wake from sleep or had locked up. Fans on, but no input response, no activity LED, no keyboard indicators or mouse optics, just the power led. The nurses pressed some buttons, gave up and left to get a spare.

My wife was pretty much exhausted from the contractions and out of it. I was now left alone with a piece of equipment that was interfering with my wife's care, so as a technical support professional decided to take matters into my own hand.

A quick diagnosis showed I was right and the usual remedies did not appear to work. I forced an unexpected reboot by removing the power lead, waited 10 seconds, then reinserted. The machine booted and proceeded to load as normal. I took my seat by my wife again.

We can fix most things at first/second line level but a lot of stuff gets passed onto an external company who do most of our IT. It's a weird system but that's how the organisation works.

Anyway we have a major system outage due to a network change over night, lots of printers stop working. 

At least 30 printers lost IP settings and naming conventions. So anyway our external company fix most of these remotely no problems no changes needed on users laptops or computers.

So I get in and get an urgent call from my boss I need to floor walk as NONE of the printers are working, bear in mind the outage was a week before. To our knowledge only one printer had not successfully been fixed and was awaiting external company to come and sort it.

Annoyingly our printers only have a 2 year support period we clear jams, change toner and soft trouble shoot. To save money out of warranty we do some jobs ourself without telling external company.

After 2 years they are replaced if anything other than rollers are faulty. 

So we need to know about printing issues asap!

Here's my findings on my floor walk

4x printers not even turned on... working fine once turned on
3 x printers out of toner new toners sat next to printer
(Most people in the company know how to change toner)

1 x printers has too much paper loaded tray is jammed shut

7 x printers have been faulty/out of action for over 6 months not reported no idea what is wrong most likely rollers or paper jams

1 x printer has been offline/not used for 3 years
(This is a big expensive colour laser worth over £1000)

People just couldn't be bothered to report to us or the external company by the looks of it. The external company run excellent support no queue times on the phone and you can report via live webchat or email. SLA is normally 1 day or a max of 3 on a printer!

Huh that's weird, no other users are calling at all either. No updates have been made by our software vendor for that part of the system recently. Nothing wrong with the printer queue for that system. I finally go down to the user's desk (there was celebration cake available in that area so I didn't do it remotely). 

She showed me how she is printing it (types in the date and PO#) and everything looks fine. When she hits print though nothing happens instead of the normal print preview being shown. It was then that she hit me with the good old ""Yeah, this actually hasn't been working for a couple of months but I just never reported it. I figured I should report it now since we're getting busier."" Sweet, so this workorder went from new minor inconvenience to an older issue that could slow work down now.

I get my piece of cake (chocolate with white frosting, edge piece because I love frosting) and go back to my desk to investigate. I go into the database to confirm that she did actually create the PO's. I look in the folder where a copy of the print jobs are usually stored, nothing. I look at the user's session log and see that no records are being selected at all so of course nothing is going to print. Finally I resort to going into the system log to get the actual query that is being run and convert it to SQL so I can poll the database directly.  Yup, still no records. Well at least I know what the problem is and I didn't have to dig into the code to figure out what is happening this time.

In the end I finally figured out that she needs to use the date from the actual PO and not the date she created the PO. She was creating PO's for the next fiscal year so of course typing in today's date was never going to yield any records. She does this sort of work every day of the year. I suppose she probably usually creates PO's with that day's date and prints them out the same day most of the time but surely printing out a PO in advance isn't THAT unusual!

This didn't make sense as I could recognize the laziness in *Hilarious nickname* as similar to the lazy streak in myself and the other 2 guys on his team were both type A personalities and very hard workers.

As I set to digging I realized *Hilarious nickname's* mistake, after every call he'd set himself to ""unavailable"" in the phone system. Normally ""unavailable"" was what you'd use if you needed a bathroom or lunch break, ""followup"" was the appropriate setting if you had finished a call and needed to tidy up your notes.

It turns out that *Hilarious nickname* thought by going ""unavailable"" after every call he wouldn't get penalized for taking a little break after every call but what really happened was that when he set himself ""available"" again he would be put at the top of the phone tree and automatically take the next call and so was unwittingly sniping calls from the other two techs.

Years later I was talking to a woman I worked with at a different company and she mentioned ""oh my friend from college says he knows you."" she told me the name but it wasn't anybody I recognized. Later that day I got an email from *Hilarious nickname*

972,One more thing...,"I am a doorman for a high end condo building and I make a little extra cash doing minor tech support for the mostly elderly residents. Getting tipped $20 for changing the input on someone's TV is a weekly occurrence. 

Today, a lady calls down proclaiming the internet is down in the building. Nobody else has complained, so no it isn't. I tell her I will come up and check. 

I get up there and she has the computer of choice for the elderly, wealthy, and technically inept, a MacBook Pro. She can't get it to connect to wireless. She keeps saying ""I can't find Milo"". Apparently she renamed her router Milo. I ask her where the router is and she takes me to the opposite end of the large apartment from where she was trying to get it to work.

I bring the laptop right next to the router since every unit has their own wifi and interference is sometimes a problem. I check the router, all is green, so that's not the problem. I do the old turn it off and on again with the laptop's wireless. The router name pops right up and it connects. Problem solved.

On my way out, her husband says ""One more thing...I found this plugged in. Do we need it?"" and holds out a wireless extender. 

I resist the urge to facepalm and tell him to plug it back in where he found it and leave it be.",False,272,8,heimdahl81,talesfromtechsupport
973,The Tales of Ted: You Tried,"I'm back with the tales of everyone's favourite tech.

This happened while I was in a meeting and was relayed to me by Andy (which, for the ones who don't know, is the senior tech guy that worked with me and Ted).

A few minutes after I left Ted started to complain that Windows Update was causing trouble with his computer, as it was very slow, often lagging and getting stuck on simple tasks. He then decided that the best course of action was to lock his workstation and disconnect his tech phone line so that he could get no calls. 

Andy suggested a few solutions, but basically was too busy to handhold Ted through the troubleshooting, and he was also rightfully annoyed.

After 15 minutes or so, another phone rings. It was a special temporary line that we had set up to do a sort of trial of our tech support for a new, very small, consulting firm. Ted had no choice but to pick up the phone, as Andy was already on a call, as he could not just let it ring without answering.

Sweet justice! It was the elderly and very tecnologically impaired owner of the consulting firm, that had trouble with his email. While Ted was babbling on the phone with him, I came back, not knowing what was going on. Ted signaled to me that I had to take the call, I asked why, and he babbled some more. I told him I could not, as I had to go to my boss' office to brief him on a project. So Ted had to unlock his workstation, which was magically working. Andy was desperately trying not to laugh, and he sent me a IM through our corporate chat software to explain why.

It was hard not to laugh in Ted's face, very hard. When I came back 30 minutes later he was still on the phone with the old man, because he had failed to understand that the problem was a simple Outlook configuration issue. The rest of the afternoon was very slow, so me and Andy got to relax a bit and do some ""housekeeping"" tasks, while Ted looked like he was about to cry.

Nice try Ted.",False,224,9,khaomanee,talesfromtechsupport

975,I Got Disconnected!,"It's been a good while since I posted on TFTS and it's good to be back. New job, same tech problems. Let's begin.

A couple of hours ago, I get a call for immediate tech support by a tech vendor. Little on specifics \(nothing new\) but the usual ""urgent"" request for help. Grabbed a couple sips of coffee and rushed over to the tech client.

The client just like almost all tech clients you deal with in the world of tech support. Acting like they know what they talking about and demanding you fix it their way. Ok, I'll play along. Ten years at my former job taught me how to play it cool and let the vendor play ""Guess Who"" about the issue until they finally get to the point.

After five minutes of rambling about how it'll affect the business, finally, they said, **""I Got Disconnected!""**. Disconnected from what, WiFi?, I calmly replied. **Heavens no, thank god, I need my YouTube fix and I love the free WiFi**, the client retorted. I wanted call her a bum at the bare minimum for that statement alone, but got to be professional and stuff. Then, she bellowed ""No, no, my phone. I broke my phone without even knowing it.""

I took look at the phone while she rambled on about missing phone conferences and not being able to pester her family. I told her she can use her cell phone. She adamantly insisted it was out of the question because she doesn't mix business with pleasure. O.....k.

Her cheap IP phone was connected to a POE switch that had the power adapter unplugged. No power, no phone. Re\-plug the switch and a few minutes later, the phone is working again.

Like most lusers, she thank me for my IT smarts and I got the hell out of there.",False,135,5,NYFranc,talesfromtechsupport
