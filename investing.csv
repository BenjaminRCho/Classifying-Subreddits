10,Fidelity Zero free funds vs more diversified Fidelity index funds. Pay nothing or pay to get slightly more diversified?,"Would it be better to invest in Fidelity's free index funds or pay to be a bit more diversified with small caps with Fidelity's regular rock bottom low cost index funds?

According to Fidelity, the Fidelity Zero Total Market Index Fund (FZROX) owns 2,500 companies, and the international stock fund (FZILX) has about 2,300 companies. Both of these funds are free, with a 0% expense ratio.

The big difference between the Zero funds and the regular Fidelity index funds is that there are no small caps in the international fund and fewer small caps in the Zero total US market fund than their regular paid index funds.

The Fidelity Total International Index Fund (FTIPX) which has an international small cap with an expense ratio of .06 has 4673 stocks. The Fidelity Total US Market Index Fund (FSTMX) has 3402 stocks in it.

I am just starting to invest in a Roth IRA and don't have enough to buy to admiral shares at Vanguard yet. Vanguard funds are far more diversified than Fidelity. By comparison, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) owns about 3,638 companies, and the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) about 6,149 companies. 

So to recap,
&gt;The Fidelity Total US Market Index Fund (FSTMX) has 3402 stocks and costs .015%.
&gt;Fidelity Zero Total Market Index Fund (FZROX) owns 2,500 companies and costs nothing.

&gt;Fidelity ZERO International Index Fund (FZILX) has about 2,300 companies and no small caps but is free.
&gt;Fidelity Total International Index Fund (FTIPX) which has a small cap with an expense ratio of .06 has 4673 stocks.

All these funds should perform relatively similarly to the benchmarks equivalents except for the Zero International fund that doesn't have small caps. The difference between the Zero US Stock market and a more diversified fund is not the biggest difference as the small cap stocks have a much smalller cap weighting in the index, but small caps have historically had the best returns over the long term.

Kirin is a subsidiary of Huawei, and, like most, is licensing from ARM, using TSMC for fab.

After being confronted at IFA conference with discovery, Huawei's president of software, Dr. Wang Chenglu, stated this was done to compete with other Chinese manufacturers engaging in the same unfair practices and that they'd ensure ""future benchmark data in presentations is independently verified by third parties at the time of the announcement.""

51,If You Had Invested In Amazon's IPO,"Graph of this issue: https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_15334_amazon_long_term_return_n.jpg

Amazon’s share price reached yet another historic high on Tuesday, briefly pushing the company’s market capitalization beyond $1 trillion. Despite the fact that Amazon’s valuation had fallen back to $995 billion by the end of the trading day, it is only a matter of time before the e-commerce giant joins Apple in the trillion dollar club.

Amazon has been on a bull run for a while now, with its share price more than quadrupling over the past three years alone. While Amazon shares have looked like a very good investment for the better part of the 21 years since the company’s IPO, the past five years really have been the icing on the cake.

Anyone smart, patient or just lucky enough to have bought Amazon shares in the company’s 1997 IPO and kept them, can now look at a small or (depending on the initial investment) sizeable fortune. As our chart illustrates, an initial investment of $180, enough to buy 10 shares in May 1997, would now be worth more than $240,000. Next to the stock price’s climb from $18 to more than $2,000, the huge return on investment can be attributed to three stock splits, which turned one share bought in 1997 into twelve shares by the end of 1999.

- Huge start up cost
- Not easily liquidable if at all

1) Not becoming a victim.... Stop telling your sob story to yourself and people! 

2) Living in the moment....Focus on the now and where you are heading. Most difficulties are caused from reviewing the past....

3) Meeting people... takes your mind off your past, your reoccurring thoughts and gives you new thoughts/information, changes your mood, and people offer you opportunities that can turn your life around. 

4) De-stressing... Such as meditation

5) Learning valuable lessons.... These setbacks have huge gems in them, if you are willing to learn them. 

6) Look forward to the future... Plan what you are doing. This will give you optimism because you will not see the past failures but the future possibility. 

7) Work hard....this takes your mind off the past again and puts you into things that will improve things going forward...

8) Lastly.....Making it back :)

126,Housing market looking forward: Trend and Cap,"I have for some time thought regarding the rise of the housing prices in the US and also most European countries during last 20-30 years. 

My main concern in that the prices for buying a property is unlikely to exceed a certain cap where people, for example, cannot afford to pay the mortgage during their lifetime. On other hand, this is unlikely to stop the banks from lending. Would you think that there is a cap on how much an average family flat or a house can cost? I feel there could be such limit unlike stocks which more or less can be traded up indefinitely. 

Second part of my thought concerns property value in the years to come. Lending starts to get pricier and the GOV interest rate in the Eurozone could likely follow the US. Do you think this is likely to have an impact of the prices looking several years forward?

131,Does this seem like a good idea,"I am 18 years old and want to invest for the first time. Individual stocks are too risky for me and I don't know enough about the market to invest properly. Thus, I have opted to go with index funds and hopefully get a better return than at the banks and also above inflation. I have heard vanguard is probably the best for me as it's cheap and widely used. I have selected two funds which I would like to invest in monthly, smallish amounts (£300 in total).

I have selected:

1. Target retirement 2060 fund (I will be around 60 years old, the allocation is 80/20 stocks/bonds)
2. S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA) which basically bets on the US stock market

Note:
I have just entered a workplace pension scheme so not 100% on the target retirement fund, although I have an excess of money at the end of each month and plenty of savings doing nothing- which I won't miss and want to work harder for me. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: after some very helpful advice I've decided to put the full £300 into the retirement fund as there is a considerable amount of overlay between the funds. I still have more money to invest amount as well as considerable savings although I preferably won't be investing lump sums (over £1K for me).

Been hearing more and more about writing options to collect premium as a source of income. For a guy in equity research who has strict restrictions on what he can hold and for how long, options are a VERY lax alternative at my company (no minimum holding period, ability to go short via puts, etc.). 

I'm an equity guy at heart so haven't spent a ton of time understanding options or how the Greeks work. That being said, I do have a basic understanding as I am a CFA.

The numbers I'm seeing being thrown out there are VERY impressive...borderline insane. I'm seeing 3-10% MONTHLY returns from collecting premium, and with indexes getting favorable tax treatment (I've seen something like 60% are treated as LT cap gains)....

Can someone help me understand the risks here? I get that in theory writing make options have an unlimited potential loss, but in reality a 2 SD move is rare enough, so anything beyond that is just hogwash IMO.

so I recently finished reading ""Factfulness"" by Hans Rosling and was thinking about how to capitalize on the big changes which await the world in the upcoming decades (according to the author, the world bank and the UN). 

The author mentiones 2 big trends which I think should be worth to invest in:
- A huge wealth gain in India. So there will be 1 Billion consumers in the next 2 decades which will have 10 dollars a day or more in their pockets. Probably will be the Chinese rise all over again, probably even top that.
- And a huge rise in population(3 Billion people over the next 80 years will be added) on the African continent where most people are still poor (in our measures) but slowly gaining wealth.

The Africa-trend is for sure the really long game. The India-trend you can already see and will just get stronger. Still long term but not nearly as long-term as the Africa-trend.

I’m curious if anyone out there has attempted to analyze subreddit submissions and comments and correlate them with the stock market or just analyze the data out of interest.

I’ve set up a simple system that pulls in all of Reddit and filters posts and comments containing stock symbols or company names. Once filtered, a simple semantic analysis algorithm is run, and these results can be aggregated in a variety of ways. For example:

-	which stocks/companies are referenced most frequently each day?
-	What is the average sentiment (feeling/opinion) for a stock over the past X amount of time.
-	is a user cross posting about a stock?
-	what is the avg sentiment for a user regarding a stock

I have thought about other ways to further the analysis. An obvious direction is to integrate financial data (IEX has a great API for this). This would make it possible to look for a correlation between stock sentiment or mentions and price (with many caveats).

I work for a company that owns Commercial Real Estate in India. Recently, the Deposits of our Tenants were invested in Mutual Funds.

187,Question about bonds and their safety,"So i tried to do some researches but I'm still confused about bonds.

This is what I understood:

\- bonds are promises of repaying back with interest, so i buy a bond for 1000$ with 3% interest with the duration of 1 year and I'll get 1030$ after one year.

\- bonds are safer than stocks because you can't lose money on them

but

\- they can lose value if new bonds with higher interest are made, does this applies only to bonds etf or to actual bonds too?

\- bonds should help during crisis because they are supposed to go up in value when stocks dip, this is why it's recommended to have a % of bonds in the portfolio.

What i don't understand is, why are most of the bonds etf i saw, barely in positive or negative? And does is it really worth sacrificing 20% of my portfolio in bonds? During bull periods being it would make the portfolio lose \~20% of the gains, does the rise of value during bear periods offsets that?

Looking at graphs of bonds etf it looks to me that I should only use them for money that i don't want risk in stocks, but don't want to keep in the bank either, but even then, they don't look that safe, take for example [ICOV](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251842/ishares-euro-covered-bond-ucits-etf), other bonds etf had periods of about 1 year in which they were negative.

\- student but should have part-time job 

\- i plan to invest most of the money i don't need in the following months but at the same time I don't want to risk them  


Let's say my original plan was to invest 200 euros a month, but i can save 500 euros a month, of course i don't want to risk all the 500 euros, would it be safe to invest 200e in stocks/etfs and put the other 300 euros in bonds?

193,Where to find investors?,"
I started an architectural products design company 2.5 years ago, and it has mostly been a friend and me doing all the work. We started a shop last year because one of our customers wanted us to also build pieces for them. I took a los the first 2 years, and this year is looking like we are going to break even. Based on what my customers are telling me and  our the results from prospecting for new business, we should be profitable next year.

To handle the increase in business I need cash for expansion, hiring, inventory, new equipment, etc. I have been looking for investors, but without much success. A lot of so called “investor” are “bait and switch lenders”, that will screw you with ridiculous rates and origination fees. Some of what I have been offered cannot be legal. The other end of the spectrum are private equity firms, that will screw you over with a complicated contract until you own nothing. The other issue I have found is that everyone wants to invest in “sexy” tech startups, which we are not.

Where do I find investors who would like to invest in small business? Obviously my company is not publicly traded. Is there a good website out there? 

I am not trolling for investors here, just wondering where to find people who are interested in non-stock market small business investing.

2. Cash. Most mutual funds have some cash. It's been a bull market in a low interest rate environment. So every bit of cash tends to be a drag on performance. In a bear market, it might be helpful to have cash.

3. It's been a narrow advance. A small number of stocks account for the bulk of the gains in SPY. Funds that are underweight the big leading stocks are going to underperform.

225,We’re shorting Square Inc (SQ) and this is why you should too,"**Description**

Square (SQ) is a payment processor which caters to small businesses. At $88.00 we think SQ has 65% downside to fair value of $36.00.  The basic premise of the short thesis is:

 

FDC is the industry giant with close to 40% market share, over the past 18 months they have put a ton of resources behind their Clover product which is aimed directly at SQ, it is currently growing 50% and is on pace to be a larger business than SQ by 2020.  Additionally, they have finally gotten their act together with digital customer onboarding (SQ’s primary early competitive edge) and will launch the capabilities through their massive distribution channel starting in the 2H 2018.  Odds are slim that this will not impact SQ competitively and slow their growth rate.

SQ’s core payment processing business growth has in fact already slowed and accelerating top line growth is being driven by more cyclical and risky businesses such as short term working capital loans (Instant Deposit) and lending origination (Square Capital).  

As a point of reference, Square does not control underwriting for their Square Capital product, if banks decided to stop lending to their micro merchants and originations dried up it would take EBIT down by about 35%.

SQ’s customers are by far the most exposed to any kind of economic downturn, close to 60% do less than $125k in volume every year and close to 85% do less than $500k.

Given the above points SQ’s valuation is absurd.  It trades at close to 20x sales and 68x EBITDA.  This is even more disgusting given that of the $245M of EBITDA the street is expecting this year about $215M will be stock comp which everyone is happy to back out (the share count was 360m in 2016 and it will end this year at 480m).

Our fair value target is 30x our 2020 eps estimate of $1.20.  Our estimates assume continued strong growth in both processing and services with steady economic growth, should a recession occur there would be significant downside to our estimates/target.

 **First Data**

 As mentioned above, FDC is the 800lb gorilla in the industry.  We think SQ has been a benefactor of the issues FDC has been having in their bank JV channel for the past 18 months or so stemming mostly from WFC’s branch commission scandal.  The JV channel was always a crown jewel for FDC because anyone who walked into a major bank to apply for a small business loan would have the processing relationship jammed in their face upon closing the deal.  Starting in Q4 of 2017 the leads generated from this channel flattened out after declining by roughly 20% and it feels like the bottom has been reached, as the banks start generating more leads its reasonable to assume some portion would be at SQ’s expense.

SQ’s early competitive edge was digital onboarding.  It takes 10 minutes and can be done without assistance.  Expenses are lower and the customer doesn’t have to deal with greasy salespeople.  Until now FDC had been way behind the curve but starting in the 2H of this year they will roll it out across all channels.  This is particularly important in the JV channel given their bank partners have a combined 6m small business accounts.

At current run rate SQ will do about $80B in GPV for 2018 its growth rate will be around 30%.  Over the same time period FDC’s Clover will do $60B in GPV and growth 50% or so.  Clover is a direct competitor to SQ and industry chatter on the platform is increasingly positive.  We think that if nothing else this shows that SQ does not have a “moat” and the payments processing industry is mature and quite competitive.  SQ’s valuation suggests it’s business model is unique and difficult to replicate, Clover’s success and growth indicates the opposite.

 

**Square Capital and Instant Deposit**

 Another reason SQ gets such a fancy multiple is because investors are excited about the accelerating revenue growth rate driven by the “Subscription and Services-Based” segment.  This accounts for 33% of the total business and grew 98% y/y in Q1.  About 65% of this segment is Square Capital and Instant Deposit and the remaining 35% other odds and ends with the largest chunk being their restaurant delivery service Caviar.  While the growth is both real and impressive we don’t think investors are baking in the cyclical risks of the lending businesses. 

The risks to Square Capital are pretty obvious.  Banks originate the loans and SQ takes 8-15% off the top.  No originations = no revenue and its basically pure profit.  We believe this will be $70m in revs/EBIT this year.

Instant Deposit has been the major growth engine for the past 12 months.  In 2016 it didn’t exist and this year it will likely be a $180M business.  Merchants get charged a 1% for instant settlement of funds versus the standard T+3.  

First of all this is very expensive, PYPL does it for a $0.25 flat fee and larger banks do it for free.  So why does SQ get this?  Our guess would be that nobody else wants to extend credit to these merchants.  

SQ claims the risk is minimal because payments are taken directly out of the merchant’s gross receipts, however, there is nothing to stop them from abandoning their terminal if business gets tough.  The company has always said a lot of their customers didn’t take cards before signing up, so there isn’t a lot stopping them from going back to cash.  This will be about $190m of revs this year with high contribution margins.

 

**Valuation**

 
On a day to day basis SQ seems to want to trade with the FANG complex and it wears a valuation to match that characterization trading at close to 20x sales.  Our issue is that there is nothing recurring about the business model, attrition is close to 20% annually, and their customers will be the first to fold in a downturn.  We think its true comps are FDC/WP/GPN which trade at between 12-19x forward earnings.  SQ deserves a premium due to its growth rate so we think 30x 2020 eps is reasonable.

 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

238,Can we have a quick discussion on how market cap weighted index funds work?,"So in the last several days there have been a few posts on how ETF may cause the next bubble/crash and I think it is caused by people not understanding how most market cap index funds work.

The theory is as Apple, amazon, Microsoft market cap grows, the index funds have to purchase more of them what causes the price to rise what causes the index funds to buy more of them and causes some sort of positive feed back loop and in a crash a negative one will also develop.

So what people fail to grasp is index funds hold actual shares of those companies . So as the share price of the company rises, guess what, the index funds holding of that company automatically rises too! Remember they actually own shares, its not like they invest a flat $3 billion into apple then need to purchase more.

They have 10 million shares that are worth 2.5 billion. As apples share price increases their 10 million shares are now worth 3 billion, they do not need to buy more shares to increase their holding because they already own apple shares!

As long as an index fund is created at the proper weight or is expanded when new money flows in at the proper weight it is self-balancing.

There is no positive or negative feedback loop going on.

Amazon, Google, and Facebook, in particular, have seen tremendous growth even though they were already big to begin with. I checked the revenue charts of these three companies over the last few years and, subjectively speaking, they look almost as dramatic as the price increases.  

What I'm confused about is where that revenue growth is coming from. Anecdotally speaking, my friends and I are buying just as much stuff from Amazon, spend about as much time on Facebook and Google services as five years ago.

260,Questions about value averaging with a constant value path.,"I was thinking about investment, and I came up with the following investment strategy. Invest a fixed amount in something, and regularly adjust back to that fixed amount. So for example, I might invest $1000 in Apple and every month either cash out the gains if the value went up, or buy more back up to $1000 if the value went down. The upside I'm seeing here is that with this strategy, you automatically buy low and sell high. 

I was wondering about whether this is a known strategy, so I tried to look it up. The closest thing I was able to find was dollar value averaging (DVA), in which you have a fixed ""value path"" that the portfolio is supposed to follow (with contributions and withdrawals selected every period so the the portfolio's value matches that path). So I guess my idea is essentially DVA with a constant value path.

My first question is this: Is this investment strategy known? Does it have a name? Are there any references I can look into?

Second question: Is this a good idea?

From some relatively-cursory research on DVA, I see the following downsides:

1) DVA requires being able to contribute more into the portfolio, which requires a liquid side account to contribute from (i.e. a cash account).

2) When a DVA portfolio grows large, it could take a lot of money to fund the losses in any particular ""down"" period. Investors may be unprepared for this and unable to follow the strategy as a result.

3) DVA provides a lower average cost per share and a higher internal rate of return (IRR) than other simple strategies but apparently does not result in a higher realized profit (according to Hayley in the paper Value Averaging and How Dynamic Strategies Bias the IRR and Modified IRR).

4) Sales can result in realizing taxable gains. 

Am I missing any downsides?

Here are my responses:

1) In my personal situation, I keep some amount of money in liquid assets (checking/savings accounts) anyway (i.e. an emergency fund). As the DVA portfolio doesn't grow in my suggested plan, the amount of liquid assets in the side account also won't need to grow, so the liquid assets I keep anyway should be sufficient. Thus, this strategy doesn't impose an ""extra"" cost of tying up money in liquid accounts because that money is tied up there anyway. 

2) In my suggested plan, the portfolio doesn't grow, so there is a cap on how much loss must be funded in any given ""down"" period.

3) I haven't looked into this enough to understand exactly what this paper asserts. What are the alternative strategies that DVA is inefficient relative to? If anyone can explain the ideas in that paper, I would appreciate that.

4) Gains in a savings account are taxable too, so I don't see much difference.

One more thing: Why would anyone do this anyway? After all, the power of investing money is in compounding gains, whereas this strategy purposefully keeps the portfolio at a fixed value. The way I see it, I'm going to put most of my money in index funds and just let it sit. The remaining uninvested money is meant to provide liquidity (i.e. an emergency fund), but even that should ideally be generating returns (i.e. sitting in a savings account). I would consider using the above strategy as a vehicle for increasing returns on some of that money at the cost of somewhat reducing liquidity and increasing risk. In that context, the idea of having an investment account that doesn't grow makes perfect sense; if the amount in my savings account grew too much, I would move some of that out (into index funds) too.

If anyone has any other thoughts about this, I'd be interested in hearing them.

305,How capital gains and losses are taxed? USA,"My situation is small so it may be insignificant.

I bought about $790 worth of stocks through a brokerage firm through my job 2 years ago, and I just had dividend reinvestment the whole time. I had the benefit of zero fees for purchasing my particular business's stocks. After about 2 years I was down to about $610, so a net loss of $180. I now have to pay trading costs. I sold the stock and paid the fee, withdrew about $20 cash, and reinvested the remaining amount into other stocks, paying the trade fee on those. 

Let's say I do no other trades for the rest of the year, how will my taxes be effected? Will I have any deductions or liabilities? Are fees included in losses or tax deductible? I'm not asking for someone to do the exact math for me, just a general idea what I should expect and what taxes apply where. I know they will send me a form at the end of the year, I don't know what it's called but I know it's basically like a W2 but for investments. Any guidance and help will be appreciated. If someone can point me to a source that has a clear cut answer, that will be fine with me. I've read multiple sites, but I can't seem to understand it fully or know how it will effect my situation. Sorry if this is basic stuff, I'm just getting into being a semi-active trader (monthly).

Also, I provided estimated dollar amounts so someone can tell me if it is significant enough to matter. I would also like to know, if not, when do taxes begin to take effect? Is there a dollar amount you have to net/gross gain or net/gross loss to effect your tax implications?

346,Old Google Finance and Yahoo Finance Alternatives,"I have been a big fan of yahoo finance and google finance.  But after google finance revamped the site and yahoo-fin seems to be always putting more ads, I have started looking at other tools. 
I have come across bunch of them and they have done a good job.  

The ones I am using are wallmine.com, snaptrade.us and finviz.com

Pros and cons of yahoo-fin:

- Well laid out site. 
- You get realtime quotes
- Great original content, videos and news 
- Watchlist and screener has basic elements. 

- **negatives**:  Too many ads in the news section.  When I look for news for a ticker ,  First 4-5 articles are all news and I need to scroll down a lot to see a real piece of news.  Also it is not quite easy sometimes to  figure out which is ad and which is not in the news section

Pros-cons of Google
- New Google Fin is mobile friendly and very much search focused.  Its a positive end here :)

- **negatives**: If you have seen old google finance in desktop, you may not use new google fin.  
- I miss all these nice charting, watchlist, recently viewed stocks, watchlist, compare any two or multiple stocks at a time   

**SnapTrade.us**
- A new site, but has really great set of features a cool black UI.  Though the black background may not work for everyone
- It has all the great stuff from old google-finance and yahoo. 
- No ads, clean site
- Watchlist has easy way to group stocks thru tagging.  
- Recently viewed sticks is a cool feature.  I think they have copied from old google, but it looks great. 
- You can share watchlist with your friends. I follow a YouTube stock dude and he shared his watchlist, so I automatically get updates when he updates with new picks. 
- They have got a good scanner, somewhat like robinhood collection, but better.   I was able to get some tips on Splunk in the upcoming earning section, and bought it and made money :)
 
- There is a discovery section which seems to have lot of technical indicator.  Since I am not into technicals, I don’t get it much
- Price alerts 
 
- **Negatives**:  quotes are not realtime, 5 minutes delayed.  I am a realtime guy.
- The site some tiles lags, but I have seen they improved
- Not optimized for mobile, mobile interface is so-so.  

**FinViz**
- Has a great home page.  Earnings before and after market close list is very handy


- Lots of indicators in the charts

- The coolest heat map of the market among all websites

- **Negatives** : Ads are very irritating.   

**Walmine** 

- They have got some great features from google finance.

- Home page has a great market snapshot

347,How do I stop the feeling of wanting to make yolo plays because my portfolio is small?,"I am 21 and have 24k in stocks. I've been invested for about a year and a half now. I am up about 25%.

I know the right thing to do is stick it into index funds and let time do its thing. However, I can't stop the feeling of wanting to yolo.

I can't shake the feeling that my portfolio is too small for any gains to be significant short term unless I yolo.

Like for example, I bought WEED with 10% of my portfolio back when it was $37 CAD. If I wasn't so risk averse and put more money in it, I would be a rich mofo right now. Instead, my portfolio is up only 4% even though the stock went up 50%.

and 4% is about $1000. I should be happy that it went up but at the end of the day, $1000 is honestly chump change in the grand scheme of things.

If I was managing something like 100k, I would be happy with it. But with 25k, nothing feels ""worth it"". You know how you read stuff like ""don't put more than 10% of your portfolio into one stock"". Does that apply even if your portfolio is small?

360,Thought Experiment: How far could you get with bond funds alone?,"I was looking at some index funds today (we're switching providers so I have to reallocate) and I wondered... How good of a portfolio could someone make with only bond funds? It would obviously have much more stunted growth than a normal portfolio, but my new provider offers a bunch of different bond funds (the old one only had two) so the thought occurred to me. While the Total Bond Market fund is fine for the vast majority of us, since bonds are mostly there to preserve capital rather than for growth, this hypothetical portfolio would need a lot of growth. I'd be impressed if you could make a stable bond-only portfolio that yielded even half a normal portfolio's growth (so like 3-3.5%).

The bond funds offered are as follows.

* VBTLX: Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (Admiral Shares)  

* VBIRX: Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VBILX: Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond Index Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VBLTX: Vanguard Long-Term Bond Index Fund	  

* VAIPX: Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VTAPX: Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VTABX: Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VEGBX: Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VWEAX: Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VWETX: Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VFIDX: Vanguard Intermediate-Term Investment-Grade Fund (Admiral Shares)  

* VFSUX: Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade Fund (Admiral Shares)  

You'd need to have a lot of high risk investments to approach anything like reasonable growth. I imagine that means the High Yield (drawn from the ""upper tier"" of junk bonds) and the Investment Grade funds. Emerging Markets too.

My guess would be something like...

40% High-Yield Corporate  
10% Long-Term Investment Grade  
10% Intermediate-Term Investment Grade  
15% Total Bond Market  
15% Total International  
10% Emerging Markets  

I was thinking of this hypothetical for someone my age, late 20s.

That's pretty volatile, but I figure you'd have to make up the growth somewhere, and the corporate bonds would get you somewhere at least. It's also hard since we're coming off a bull market for bonds that probably won't be repeated in the next couple decades.

Anyone else have a better idea? If this interests anyone else that is, ha. Feel free to use whatever other bond funds are out there, I was just thinking about these because I was staring at them as I did my 401(k) allocation today.",g7889,investing
361,Tencent-Backed China EV Maker NIO Seeks $1.3 Billion in U.S. IPO,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-backed-china-ev-maker-034333355.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-backed-china-ev-maker-034333355.html)

​

It has its IPO in a couple weeks and it looks like some of Tesla's backers are involved quite heavily with NIO as well:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2018/07/24/as-tesla-begs-its-suppliers-for-capital-nio-has-raised-billions-from-some-of-teslas-key-investors/#4fc5c7bf5611](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2018/07/24/as-tesla-begs-its-suppliers-for-capital-nio-has-raised-billions-from-some-of-teslas-key-investors/#4fc5c7bf5611)

&gt;A quick check of Tesla's most recent proxy statement shows Baillie Gifford owned 12.9 million shares as of December 31, 2017, giving the firm a 7.6% stake in Tesla and ranking them as the company's number three shareholder after Musk and Fidelity.  It was widely reported at the time of Tesla's March 2017 follow-on offering that Tencent had acquired a stake of just under 5% in Tesla via participation in the deal. If those shares are still held, it means that Tesla's third and fifth largest shareholders--owning a combined 12.6% of the company--are also invested in one of the company's key competitors.

​

The specs of their electric car are comparable to Tesla vehicles in speed and charging but are a little cheaper.  With tariffs, they may make a comparable price in the US.  Financials don't really tell a story yet IMO.

367,Growth Investing vs Value Investing - Help!,"Hi everyone.

​

I started investing in 2014 with the guidance of my dad. His strategy is to buy safe, dividend paying ""blue chip"" companies. Hold for the long term and turn on a DRIP for the passive income to snowball.

​

Fast forward to now, nearly all my blue chip dividend companies (Enbridge, Bell, Riocan, Emera, etc) have gone nowhere but down or sideways, and the dividend hardly covers the capital losses from the stock price going down.

​

Now obviously I've only been in the game a few years, and I know this is supposed to be a long term strategy. But when I look at growth companies (Microsoft, NVidia, Apple, Visa, Weedstocks etc), I see massive share price appreciation, and the potential money I could have made in growth stocks far exceeds my blue chips by an untold number.

​

Now I'm sitting here with my Blue Chip portfolio all in the red, while I watch my 1 and only growth stock (Canopy) make me more money in 6 months than all my blue chips combined in the last 3 years.

​

How can anyone think Value investing is superior to Growth investing? Please help me understand. I see so much potential in growth stocks, and nothing but ugly charts and red in so-called ""blue chip"" companies.

​

Did I waste my time with this ""dividend growth investing"" strategy? Is this an ""old man"" strategy that typically is used for retiree's, or is it a valid long term strategy that can make as much or more than growth investing?",LuxGang,investing

374,SMID Value,"Okay r/investing - discussion time.

As we all know, small and mid cap value has a 40 year track record that blows the total market out of the water, with comparable max drawdowns. Particularly small cap value.

And yet, the most common advice I see is to invest in indexes that track the general market, or a cross section that includes a blend of large, mid, and small cap securities - usually heavily emphasizing large caps. 

So, what's the reasoning behind this? If you're following an aggressive, long term, 100% equity strategy anyway, why is the prevailing advice to focus on large cap securities at the expense of the historically better performing SMID universe?

Past performance does not indicate future results, but is there something about the modern market that discourages being too heavily weighted in this sector?

381,High Yielding Dividend Stocks (And Selling Covered Calls),"I've owned some Prospect Capital shares for a couple of years now. I was just looking at the options being sold and I got this idea. Wanted to see what everyone thought of it. I imagine similar stocks should generate similar results. I'm going to assume only buying 100 (the minimum to sell the contract) shares even though that's a small investment. The current share price and option prices might be a little off since they announced earnings yesterday and it caused some movement after hours (increase).

Current cost is $7.15 as of closing yesterday. They pay a monthly dividend of $0.06. So I'd receive 16 months worth of dividends before the contract expires. That's $0.96 per share. As of yesterday the mark for a $3 call with a Jan 17/2020 expiration was $3.85. Unfortunately, and probably the biggest flaw with this idea, the spread was $1.30 (max bid $3.20, ask $4.50). The bid + dividends basically = the share price yesterday so that wouldn't work but maybe a stock with more volume would allow this to work. 

Assuming you bought the shares at $7.15 ($715 total) and sold the options at the mark ($380) total. You'd be out of pocket $335. You'd be collecting $96 in dividends by expiration. It's definetely going to close in the money so at expiration you'll get another $300 ending up in a $61 profit (+18.2% on the out of pocket amount, +8.5% on overall investment).

Obvious issues are getting the contract to sell at the mark with the ridiculous spread and tax implications which I'll admit I don't know off hand since I just started thinking about this.

Are there any other downsides I'm missing? Do the taxes basically ruin the concept? ",mrdhood,investing

394,Canada's Looming Debt Crisis,"Canada will face many headwinds over the coming years. Debt, immigration, pension funding, and deficits are all areas that economists can see the cracks. Here we will investigate the Debt issue more closely.

Debt:

Economists say that ‘Canada is 10 years behind the USA.’ Unfortunately, it seems that they are right again. The 2008 financial crisis was a result of overspending by the US consumer. 10 years later Canada isn’t in the same position, we’re in a worse position than the US was.

Canada’s consumer debt is skyrocketing and does not show any signs of slowing down. Debt to disposable income is unbelievably high coming in at 170% in Dec 2017 and with rising interest rates will likely be higher in Dec 2018.

To make matters worse housing prices have been rising over the same period. The new housing pricing index topped 103.20 in June 2018. The average home price has risen 45.01% over the last 5 years in Canada. Have the homes become 45% better? Of course not, but Canadians are still buying them.

How about the government, they aren’t getting involved in this debt picture right? Unfortunately, they are. Government debt to GDP levels are nearing 20-year highs. To make matters worse the Canadian government is aiming to balance the budget by 2019/2020. The odds of this balanced budget are extremely low however given the Liberal’s past 3 years.

Now add in the Central Bank of Canada. Their balance sheet is exponential. Whenever there is even a whiff of a recession the BOC swoops in to ‘save the day’ and purchase more equities. To make everyone happy the BOC lowers interest rates to the lowest rates seen to the Canadian consumer in history. Why wouldn’t you borrow? Money is cheap, everyone else is doing it, even the government is getting in on the spending action.

So where is the problem? It lies in inflation. Inflation is back in the Canadian market and it looks like it is here to stay. If inflation reaches a 3 handle in 2018 and possibly a 4 in 2019 as some economists have predicted the BOC will have to react. The BOC has indicated they will be raising rates and shrinking their balance sheet in the 2018 and 2018.

The picture we have painted is the perfect storm:

1. Highly levered consumer
2. High government spending still running deficits
3. Rising inflation
4. Rising interest rates
5. BOC decreasing spending and beginning to sell off assets

There is one wild card in all of this. If Canada runs into a recession or a financial crisis, the BOC could do the same as it did in 2008: Print money and buy equities. If this were to happen it could cause a quick fix, but the Loonie would feel the pain shortly after.

What’s the play? If you’re looking to make some money on this, consider a short CAD Bank, long US Bank strategy. The dividends you pay on your short position would be mitigated by your long position. The Canadian banks are trading at a 1.8 price to book ratio in comparison to a 1.41 P/B for US banks.

The Canadian banks have had a great run over the past 10 years, but their customers are stretched financially. Loan demand will begin to slow, and defaults will rise as interest rates rise. The result is a stronger US bank in comparison.

2. In the landlording table, the numbers are the ""cash flow"". So, initially the numbers change as the years go by.
3. I have included maintenance, depreciation and also that the landlord invests the cashflow if it is &gt;0$. It is not apparent. 

Edit:
I am not getting into landlording, but want to just simulate one example. Setting aside the issue of ""managing people"", does it sound right? IRR being higher for landlording.

With their new tower in San Francisco at the new Transbay Terminal, the feeling in the air here is very strong. Last May, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, an integration software that brings apps on premises and cloud together. 

In my line of work, Mulesoft is a powerful platform that is used widely in major organizations and I believe this position will be key to their revenue growth. On one hand, Salesforce sold a debt bond of 2.5B to secure the deal, affecting their balance sheet, but the revenue opportunity will show in P&amp;Ls to come. 

The bay area tech rumor mill is that Dropbox is next.  Earlier this year, SF invested $100M in the company's IPO, and Dropbox has been integrating greatly with them. Though Dropbox has a much higher market cap than when Mulesoft was acquired, SF continues to buy shares in company. 

In the past year, the share price has surged 61% and I expect the trend to continue.

407,Why a trend divergence in the S&amp;P 500 and the VIX may spell trouble for stocks,"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-a-divergence-in-the-sp-500-and-the-vix-may-be-a-problem-for-stocks-2018-08-28


The S&amp;P 500 and the Cboe volatility index — the so-called fear index — tend to trend in opposite directions since investors have less to worry about when the stock market rallies, and vice versa.

However, in recent days, this well-choreographed relationship has been thrown off balance, with the VIX hovering significantly above its 52-week lows even as the large-cap index continues to carve out new records.

The VIX is a measure of the market’s expectation for volatility over the next 30 days and is calculated from the implied volatilities of S&amp;P 500 index options. A low reading indicates a calm market while a higher number suggests elevated uncertainty.

Dana Lyons, a partner J. Lyons Fund Management Inc., thinks this divergence deserves closer scrutiny given that such disconnects have previously heralded tough times ahead for stocks....

419,Lean Hog Futures - A Look at Market Fundamentals and Supply &amp; Demand Drivers (x-post from /r/thewallstreet),"#Overview

**From Barchart** 

* [Link](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/HE*1/profile) 

&gt; “Hogs are generally bred twice a year in a continuous cycle designed to provide a steady flow of production. The gestation period for hogs is 3-1/2 months and the average litter size is 9 pigs. The pigs are weaned at 3-4 weeks of age. The pigs are then fed to maximize weight gain. The feed consists primarily of grains such as corn, barley, milo, oats, and wheat. Protein is added from oilseed meals. Hogs typically gain 3.1 pounds per pound of feed. The time from birth to slaughter is typically 6 months. Hogs are ready for slaughter at about 254 pounds, producing a dressed carcass weight of around 190 pounds and an average 88.6 pounds of lean meat. The lean meat consists of 21% ham, 20% loin, 14% belly, 3% spareribs, 7% Boston butt roast and blade steaks, and 10% picnic, with the remaining 25% going into jowl, lean trim, fat, miscellaneous cuts, and trimmings. Futures on lean hogs are traded at the CME Group. The futures contract is settled in cash based on the CME Lean Hog Index price, meaning that no physical delivery of hogs occurs. The CME Lean Hog Index is based on the 2-day average net price of slaughtered hogs at the average lean percentage level.”

**From TheBalance**

* [Link](https://www.thebalance.com/lean-hogs-profile-809279)

&gt; “Most hog production occurs in the Midwest. The largest hog producing states are Iowa, North Carolina, Minnesota, and Illinois. The U.S. is the world's largest pork exporter. Normally, it takes six months to raise a pig from birth to slaughter. Hogs are generally ready for market/slaughter when they reach a weight near 250 pounds.

&gt; A market hog with a live weight of 250 pounds will typically yield 88.6 pounds of lean meat (Pork Facts 2001). This lean meat consists of an average of 21 percent ham, 20.3 percent loin, 13.9 percent belly, 3 percent spareribs, 7.3 percent Boston butt roast and blade steaks, and 10.3 percent picnic. The rest goes into jowl, lean trim, fat and miscellaneous cuts and trimmings (USDA-AMS).
Pork bellies, which used to trade on the CME, are mainly used for bacon and can be frozen and stored for up to a year prior to processing. The contract was discontinued due to a lack of liquidity. Tips on Trading Lean Hog Futures: Seasonality tends to lead hog prices higher between May and July the heart of grilling season in the United States.

&gt; The price of corn has a strong correlation with lean hog futures because hogs eat corn. If the price of corn rises substantially, farmers tend to take their hogs to market at lower weights (younger) to avoid high feed costs. At these times, lean hog futures prices tend to drop due to increased supplies.
One can estimate the future amount of hog production by monitoring the Hogs and Pigs Report. When the number of newborn pigs is lower than in previous quarters, it is likely that hog production will be lower in six months later when they are ready for market.”

**The Lean Hog (cash) Index or LHI**

As stated above, the Lean Hog futures contract is financially settled and uses the CME's 2 day weighted average cash index to determine the final price.  The details of the index can be found [here](http://www.cmegroup.com/rulebook/CME/II/150/152/152.pdf).  

Note that the cash index is related to the cash that is paid for *live hogs* and not for the finished pork product.

The data the index uses are released in report [""LM_HG201""](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lm_hg201.txt) which details prior day production for US hogs.  This report is issued every weekday morning around 10am central and allows you to calculate the CME index before they publish it since they typically lag 2 days in their reporting.  [Calculation](https://imgur.com/a/MSEIULB). Note that the report isn’t released at any specific time as I’ve seen it range from 10:30am to 11:30am (and sometimes not until after the market closes on the days where the contract settles due to “packer submission issues”….)

[Cash Index since 2016](https://imgur.com/a/B7yVRIG)

For a quick overview, these cash prices are what packing plants (e.g. Tyson) are paying to Hog producers for their livestock. Another important data point is the cutout value which indicates what packers are able to sell their products for.  We can determine their margins based on the values they're paying for hogs and the values they can sell the end product for.  From here we can get a glimpse at future action depending on a few other variables most notably demand (consumer spending, international trade relationships, global demand for protein, seasonality etc.)

- [Cutout AM](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lm_pk600.txt) released around 11am central

- [Cutout PM](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lm_pk602.txt) released around 3pm central and these are the final daily prices.

- [Hog Daily Summary](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lsddhps.pdf) released shortly after the PM report

- [Here’s a link that provides a bit more detail on the various reports &amp; pricing methodologies](https://www.nationalhogfarmer.com/marketpreview/undertstanding-usda-hot-price-reports-1214)

The important thing to note is that the future price and cash index will converge at the end of every contract's life.  This isn't always the case in physically delivered contracts but it is in the financially settled ones. It is worth noting that it won’t be an exact convergence but rather an educated estimate so there is some arbitrage opportunity here but the market is fairly efficient so it’s very hard to get an edge.

#October Contract

[Here is what the October contract looks like today](https://imgur.com/a/41h1JQW)

Currently there's a $2.85 positive spread between the futures price of $51.78 (8.24.18) and the latest CME index of $48.93 (8.23.18). The October contract began its descent on June 28th when the quarterly Hogs and Pigs report was released [(Link)]( http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/HogsPigs/HogsPigs-06-28-2018.pdf). This report showed that the total hog inventory was up 3%, which was the highest June 1st inventory measured since it was first measured starting back in 1964. The breeding inventory was up 3% YoY, the marketing inventory was up 3% YoY, and the March-May 2018 pig crop was up 4% YoY.  The report showed that hog production from mid-July through November would be, on average, 3.7% higher YoY which was higher than the trade had been expecting. It also showed that the breeding herd increased by 3.5% YoY which is much higher than the trade’s estimate at +1.7% YoY. Long story short, this report showed that production in the second half of 2018 would be record large and that the growth of the herd was still strong and not expected to slow in the near term. 

What has happened since then is that packers have broken the cash (I’m referencing the LHI) down from a June 22nd peak of $86.20 to the latest index price of $48.93 on August 23rd ([Link to the August contract shows how much of a break in pricing this was]( https://imgur.com/a/THzfTpD) ). The break in the cash was intensified by producers pulling forward inventory to take advantage of higher cash pricing in Q3 than what they feared they would have to take in Q4 which could be seen with the implied pricing given by the December contract ( [Shown Here]( https://imgur.com/a/JKPAcOO) ).

The week of August 15th brought a significant rally in futures pricing due to a combination of a potential NAFTA breakthrough and initial ASF (African Swine Flu, which I’ll get into later) which was largely driven by short covering. These gains in the October contract have mostly been given back as NAFTA did not come along as quickly as hoped, cash pricing continued to decline and reality set back in.

#2019 and Potential Supply Disruptions 

As mentioned above, domestic pork production in the United States will remain at high levels until the herd begins to experience a contraction. Going off the assumption that any contraction will not be likely to occur until at least 2019, one can infer that prices will very likely remain at depressed levels for the near term. However, there are a couple factors that could begin to change up the S&amp;D picture for 2019.

**1)**	Trade resolutions that increase demand for exports

Earlier this year, Mexico put into a place a series of tariffs that were designed as a way of striking back against the United States for its steel &amp; aluminum tariffs. Since Mexico is the largest single international buyer of pork, there were specific tariffs placed upon pork (only the most popular cuts) and it’s very important to note that there was a 350K ton allowance before these duties are implemented. The result of these tariffs was enough to drive the cutout pricing lower which actually increased demand for pork outside of Mexico as shown on the chart below:

[Weekly pork export sales per Allendale](https://imgur.com/a/FHRyooR)

It’s difficult to determine how much of an effect a NAFTA resolution could actually have on cash prices and may end up being more psychological than anything. It could however drive buyers back to the market with the assumption being that they would want to start purchasing cheap product while they can.

**2)**	Diseases that shrink the supply

Earlier this month, African Swine Fever (ASF) was discovered in China for the first time and since then there have been a total of 4 outbreaks spread across a wide geographical distance.
 [This article from “Sciencemag” does a great job in describing the virus and some of the implications.]( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/can-china-world-s-biggest-pork-producer-contain-fatal-pig-virus-scientists-fear-worst)

[USDA special report on African Swine Fever in China]( https://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Expansion%20of%20African%20Swine%20Fever%20Outbreak%20in%20China_Beijing_China%20-%20Peoples%20Republic%20of_8-17-2018.pdf)

[WSJ on ASF in China]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-swine-fever-outbreak-spreads-1535034211)

[Bloomberg – “ASF could impact US-China trade talks”]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-24/chinese-pig-disease-could-impact-trade-talks-analyst-says)

&gt; It isn’t possible to predict with any certainty how the disease will spread -— there could be sporadic outbreaks with an insignificant national effect. But the density of hogs and the scale at which they are raised in China creates a serious risk, Stuart said. A widespread outbreak could lead to mass culling of hogs, and since imports represent about 3 percent of China’s pork consumption, even a 10 percent cull would have significant impacts on import needs.

&gt; ""It’s not like they need the U.S.,"" Stuart says, noting that the European Union is a bigger exporter, supplying about 55 percent of the Chinese market, so the potential impact from the disease on trade talks wouldn’t be immediate. ""But when you look at potential, it could get to a scenario where they consider lifting the duties.""

The best case scenario for China is that the disease doesn’t spread beyond these current outbreaks and the losses remain relatively minimal. The worst case is the Chinese can’t contain the virus and it begins to spread in such a way that they are forced to cull massive numbers of hogs. Should this happen, its possible China will have to turn to foreign importers to replace the lost supply which could be the EU given their already sizable export program and China’s current trade issues with the US.
However, it’s probably worth mentioning that Romania just had a large outbreak of ASF ( [Reuters Link]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-swineflu-pigs/african-swine-fever-hits-romanias-biggest-pig-farm-idUSKCN1LA0LR?il=0) ) within their largest pig breeding farm that will result in the culling of 140K animals. It seems as though there were outbreaks on smaller farms in the region and those farmers ended up tossing the dead carcasses in the Danube River which this larger commercial farm uses for drinking water. 

By itself, the outbreak in Romania is probably not an issue worth concern but it’s worth keeping an eye on in case this spreads to somewhere like Germany which rivals the US in terms of export value (both export 15% of the global value). This would be the worst case scenario and probably unlikely due to the health &amp; animal welfare standards in Western Europe (example: Denmark is actually building a fence to keep wild boars out of its borders).
Overall, it’s worth keeping an eye on but it will be a non-issue if they contain it.

432,"Where's the ""moat"" or value for companies like Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab? Aren't they essentially worthless? What am I missing here?","**TLDR: Ridesharing companies' massive valuations are based off of a driverless taxi future. However, it seems that in this future almost all the profits will go to the companies that have solved the hard tasks of manufacturing the cars and designing the self driving AI software, not the relatively easy to replicate task of building the app that customers use to order the taxis. What am I missing here?**

In light of the Uber IPO next year I've been thinking about the multi billion valuations for ridesharing companies like Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab.

As far as I can see, their perceived value comes from driverless cars. The idea is that in the future many people won't even own a car, they will just call up a driverless taxi when they want to go somewhere (the combination of no drivers' salaries and the fact that cars being able to drive 24/7 will reduce the number of cars that need to be bought will make the taxi services cheaper than owning your own car). Ridesharing companies, as the tools with which customers call their robo-taxis, will hence get a big slice of this multi-trillion dollar market.

However, I can't understand why these ridesharing companies get a place in this driverless future at all. As far as I can see, we can break down the driverless taxi service into three components:

* **Manufacturing the actual physical cars.** This is a very difficult engineering challenge; it requires both great industry knowledge and a large number of factories. This ""moat"" makes it hard for someone to just come in and start their own car manufacturing company, which in turn ensures that the company can have a decent markup/profit on their cars.
* **Designing the AI software that drives the cars.** Again, this is a very hard engineering challenge which ensures that there's a ""moat"" that stops competitors and hence safeguards profits.
* **Building the app that people use to call up the taxi.** I'm not saying this task is entirely trivial, but (speaking as someone who works in tech/AI) it's not that hard for a reasonably large tech company to quickly make a reasonable looking app that lets users order a taxi, and it's definitely nowhere near as hard as the first two. As far as I can see, there's very little ""moat"" here, anyone can easily move into this area, which means that there's very little profit available in just running the app that people use to contact the cars.

As far as I can see, if driverless cars become feasible/reliable, then it's very likely that the companies with the driverless AI software will just buy cars (or partner with car manufacturing companies) and launch their own taxi service because there's no way that they're going to let Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab act as a middleman and keep a big slice of the profits. I suppose that the existing ridesharing companies could stay in business by cutting prices until they're only marginally higher than the cost of cars+driverless software, but then they're not gonna make much profit and hence don't justify their current massive vaulations.

I've seen a couple of counterarguments to this, but they don't make sense to me:

* **The ridesharing companies can build/are building their own driverless car technology.** Firstly, driverless car technology is extremely difficult, and from what I've read, companies like Uber are well behind the industry leaders like Google's Waymo and GM Cruise. Furthermore, I don't see why starting work on driverless cars (or claiming you can make them in the future) justifies the huge valuations that ridesharing companies currently have; surely it makes more sense to give a large valuation to the startups that have made the most progress in driverless cars (the technology that's hard to replicate) rather than the startups which have so far only proved that they can build a taxi app (the technology that's very easy to replicate).
* **The network effect/brand loyalty.** From what I can tell, this just doesn't really apply much to taxi services. All the available evidence has shown that consumers pick the cheapest service that  can keep waiting times below 3 minutes (i.e. there's no extra network effect once your company has a certain number of cars in a given city). If I recall correctly the driver's salary is about 85% the cost of a taxi ride; while ridesharing companies can cut this cost a bit, the reality is that a company with good driverless car tech could easily undercut ridesharing companies by a ridiculous margin while still remaining profitable. In terms of reaching the number of cars needed to keep waiting times below 3 minutes, a large company like Google can just buy the cars needed to achieve this in a given city, take over the market in that city, and then move onto the next one (this is a bit different to something like Facebook where there's a global network that is harder to disrupt unless you can convince a large number of people all over the world to move to your service at the same time).

Of course, there's a reasonable chance that driverless cars will prove to be infeasible with current technology. But then the main ""nobody will own their own car any more"" value proposition for these companies is gone. And furthermore, due to the lack of proper network effects that I mentioned earlier, it's unlikely that these companies will be able to make much profit at all (since someone else will come in the moment that they try to jack up prices). Hence again I can't see why these companies have such high valuations.

What am I missing here? Why are the valuations for these companies so high?",WaveML,investing

Does anyone have any experience using The Turnaround Letter ([https://www.turnaroundletter.com/turnaround-letter-sample-issue-1](https://www.turnaroundletter.com/turnaround-letter-sample-issue-1)) as a guide for investing for high returns?

According to the Hulbert Ratings ([http://hulbertratings.com/12-month-scoreboard/](http://hulbertratings.com/12-month-scoreboard/)), it returned 79% over the past year. Because I can't see how it performed in previous years, who knows if it may have lost 80% at some point?

I was able to download the January 2018 Letter, which recommended WFT, for free, and decided to buy 209 shares at $2.786/share. If it doubles within two years, it will have been worth it.

Whether you're for or against it, we can at least all agree that at it's current stage, it's an extremely high risk investment, or rather that the risk is virtually unquantifiable at this point.

In either case, even if one never ""understood"" the value of Bitcoin, arguably most average joe investors in traditional markets don't understand the value of their investments either, they're just following the advice of their financial advisors or following the wisdom of the crowd. As they should in situations where they are not experts. 

So what do you think it would take for either yourself or the mainstream opinion of experts and/or the general public to shift? What metrics or turning points would you be looking at to determine whether it's reached a point of legitimacy? Even if you held a very strong belief that Bitcoin is eventually going to zero, what would you need to see before you would start to question that belief?

For an extreme example, if in 2080 we find that 98% of the world used Bitcoin for 98% of their transactions and 98% of their store of value for the last 100 years, and there were thousands of financial institutions and products built around it, it would obviously be well beyond the point where it was legitimate. Anyone who didn't think so at that point would be part of the lunatic fringe, as arguably most Bitcoiners are now.

477,The other side of the power curve: the long tails can also generate wins,"The original article is [here](https://medium.com/@quantvc/power-laws-in-venture-capital-why-the-long-tail-matters-22e057c6fa34). 

My best summary:

Venture capital returns are highly skewed and probably best characterized by power law distributions (the 80/20 rule), where a few startups generate most of the economic returns. 

&gt; if you apply the 80–20 rule to the top 20% of venture capital deals, then 4% of the deals produce 64% of all returns. Apply the 80–20 rule again to the top 4% of deals and you get 0.8% of deals producing 51.2% of all returns. The implication is that 1 in 20 deals may produce 2/3 of all returns and 1 in 100 deals may return more than all other deals combined.

This implies that VCs should ""only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund"" and ignore the rest. However, unicorns are rare even among top portfolios and are very hard to predict in the early stage. The average growth rate of all small businesses in the US is closer to 7.5% than 30%.

On the contrary, it is possible to generate high returns from startups outside the top 20%. Example: Union Square Ventures, which focuses on the “long tail of investments that don’t move the needle for the VC fund.”. The fat tail of the power law curve is systematically under-invested in and represents a treasure trove of opportunities.

&gt; The power law curve reflects the idea that “we want everyone to become a hyper-performer” if they can find the right fit, and that we don’t limit people at the top of the curve -- we try to create more of them.

Humanity could be a competitive advantage in the cut-throat tech startup / VC world.

486,"Suddenly need to live off of my investments. How does my vanguard allocation mix sound? Bonus question: How to plan for moving investments from a financial advisor to myself, how is Vanguard flagship program?","Hello! I have bombarded r/financialindependence far too much as I navigate my finances, and this question is far more ""investment"" focused than FIRE.

About me: I am 28 y/o, have about 1 MM net worth. I am suddenly having to live off of my investments for the foreseeable future due to family circumstance and having to be a full time caretaker. I do bring in a few hundred a month from various side projects. My yearly expenses are to the tune of 30k, no debt. Until recently, I was very cautious and not investing what I should, so I'm trying my best to mitigate that.

Current allocation: Merrill Lynch 25/65/10 for fixed income/stocks/cash. That had been bringing me in around \~1.5 k a month, which was a great bonus bit of cash while I was working, and the rest was growth. This is after the 1% fee to my advisor who manages my portfolio. That's for about $750k. I have about 10k in a Roth with them.

The remainder of my funds I have been moving into Vanguard. I am hoping that without the 1% fee, I can use the growth from my Vanguard acct + the 3% draw from ML to have a cumulative interest in the 25-30k range which would allow me to take care of my parents until we figure out a more reliable assisted living situation for them. I had that money uninvested as I was planning on using it for a house and some other career related expenses, but again my circumstances have changed severely so that money is now available for investing.

Current planned Vanguard allocation:  70/30 stocks/bonds with the 30 in BNDThe 70 stocks to be 60 VTI/40 VXUS.... I'm wondering if I should switch 80/20 stocks/bonds or 70 VTI/30 VXUS?How does my current allocation sound?

In terms of my ML assets; I really like my financial advisor. He has been really helpful in assisting my navigation of my finances, starting my own business, etc. But now that I'm hoping to live off of my investments, that 1% is really steep. I saw that Vanguard has a flagship program where you can get a free financial advisor past 1 MM. However, I have no idea how to move my accounts that way or how to navigate my current stocks with ML. Also, before I learned about the flagship program, I was hoping to just move to Merrill Edge; I have their premium rewards credit card, and it seems for self management, that Merrill Edge is not too different from Vanguard with the added benefit of me already being tied up in ML.

My options are as follows:---- Move my own vanguard amounts to ME, same ETFs and there is no fee for doing so. Keep the current ratios.----Same as above but slowly move more of my investments into my own control with ME. I would need guidance on how to do this.---Keep my vanguard amount in vanguard, slowly move over investments over to vanguard----Move everything into vanguard once I'm feeling confident enough to do so and utilize their free advising service

I have been trying to read as much as I can; I recognize that I have not made the best financial decisions and am now trying to mitigate those mistakes.

487,What is your plan when a stock hits your evaluation before it becomes a long term gain?,"Let's say I wanted to buy AMD at $26, but I agree with the evaluation of X company that it will hit $30.    

Let's say AMD hits my target of $30 before the stock becomes a long term gain.  Is it better to just sell then because it hit my target, or should I hold until it's a long term gain?

I guess what I could do is add in the tax difference, so it wouldn't make a difference?  So, if AMD hitting $32 would cancel out the taxes of it being a short term gain compared to a long term gain.  Then I can sell as if I held it for a year.

501,Billionaire Howard Marks: Computers won't put the best human investors out of business.,"What's your thoughts on this? Machine learning and AI  would absolutely have impact on headcount reduction at a lower level. ER will see a significant impact of this trend as jobs for pattern recognition and data cleaning will no longer require an analyst. 

\-----

Howard Marks believes top investors can still thrive even as trading machines become more active in the financial markets.

""Computers can do an unmatched job dealing with the things that can be counted: things that are quantitative and objective. But many other things — qualitative, subjective things — count for a great deal, and I doubt computers can do what the best investors do,"" Marks said Monday in a note to clients entitled ""Investing Without People.""

Marks, whose firm, Oaktree Capital, had $121 billion of assets under management as of March, said computers can't do things such as meet and assess management teams, listen to venture capital presentations and look at buildings for real estate investments.

""The greatest investors aren't necessarily better than others at arithmetic, accounting or finance; their main advantage is that they see merit in qualitative attributes and/or in the long run that average investors miss,"" he said. ""And if computers miss them too, I doubt the best few percent of investors will be retired anytime soon.""

Marks is known for his prescient investment memos, which warned about the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble implosion.

The Oaktree co-chairman noted computers can help investors make more informed decisions, but they won't replace human insight.

""Computers, artificial intelligence and big data will help investors know more and make better quantitative decisions. But until computers have creativity, taste, discernment and judgment, I think there'll be a role for investors with alpha,"" he said.

504,Why did BLV drop on 31 Jan 2018 just like SPY?,"I'm currently looking for a safe bond fund. I've mostly picked BLV due to its low correlation to the stock market, specifically SPY. However I noticed on January 31st, it dropped just like the S&amp;P 500 yet never recovered unlike the S&amp;P.

I'm looking for reasons. Here are a few conjectures of my own.

1. Profit taking - The tax bill had just been passed a month earlier and people were selling their stocks (including bond etf's) as part of profit taking.
2. Bonds exploded - Traders could tell this new tax bill is going to cost a trillion dollars of debt to fund. Yields on bonds had been pushed low for almost a decade due to Quantitative Easing (QE). With QE over and the government instituting a giant stimulus so late into a bull market, yields on bonds raised to help fund the skepticism on newly issued government debt. 
3. Gov Debt vs. Corp Debt - With the new trillion dollar deficit, government debt at higher yields would be more attractive than riskier corporate debt. This leading to a squeeze in the corporate market having to pay for debt at a higher rate and for the government having to pay higher yields as well, leading to a less profitable future for companies and thus lower tax revenue.

These are just 3 guesses. They are not definitive reasons. I'm open to hearing other ideas and would be extremely interested. Maybe it could be as simple as a government official saying that bond holders were going to take a haircut, causing the market to dive. Please share your ideas and views. ",matty1monopoly,investing

509,Pay taxes now or defer later?,"This is prob the million dollar question and I still don’t think I understand which is better.  I just met with a CFA and he said it was best for me to start a 401k for my business and pay up to $55k a year into it. His reasoning was it’s better to postpone taxes today (currently in the 35% marginal bracket with $550k gross income a year) and let the largest amount of money create gains in a 401k over the next 30 years.  He said I would make 2-4% more each year investing pre tax money vs just paying the taxes now and having post tax money in a brokerage account.

Here are some ramblings that maybe someone can help me understand:

1) 401k is pretax but how is the entire account taxed when I withdraw?  Is the gains taxed at capital gains rates but the principle is taxed at my retired income tax bracket OR is all the money taxed at my retired income tax bracket?

2) considering a long term max tax liability of 10-20%, is there really any way to beat this rate?  My goal is to retire and pull $72k a year to live on 4% of my total investment portfolio (not counting SS). If this amount was taxed as income, my effective tax rate would be around 12%.  If I held post tax investments, my effective tax rate would 10% on that same amount of withdrawal.

My current allocation is roughly 5% cash, 20% bonds, 5% property, and 70% stocks, split among three markets.

My only thought is that most of the articles/videos I've seen seem to be considering portfolios which are not being added to regularly -- they start with say $100k, split 50/50 or 60/40 or whatever, and then quarterly/annually/whatever rebalance, generally selling stocks and buying bonds.

My intention is that I will be adding money regularly, and pulling money out very rarely (touch wood). It seems to me that I can achieve the same result by simply buying whatever is below my desired allocation in any given month. I should only need to sell out of one class when another class falls more in a year than I am able to make up with my regular income.

529,Do you realize that stock dividends are basically an accounting gimick?,"Everyone on this board wants dividends!  High dividends, growing dividends, dividend ETF's, DIVIDENDS, DIVIDENDS, and More DIVIDENDS!

Trouble is in reality a stock dividend is noting more than an accounting gimmick!  There is really no value in getting a dividend anymore.  Yes, before people could buy and sell stocks online, dividends were helpful in creating income without the hassle of actually selling shares of stocks.  But now with low or no transaction fees, there is little reason to even think about dividends. If you want income from your stocks to pay expenses, just sell shares on a scheduled basis.

Many investors think that getting a stock dividend is like getting interest on your money from a bank account.  It's not! When a stock, Mutual Fund or ETF pays a dividend, the NAV (Value) of the stock will go down an equal amount than the dividend the evening before the dividend is paid.  If you reinvest the investment, you come out even.   If you pull out the dividend payment out of your account, you basically just did a scheduled withdrawal.

Many people who don't understand dividends will buy shares of the investment a few days before the stock is scheduled to pay a dividend and then sell it right after the dividend is paid.  They think they are making money this way.  They may make money if the value of the stock goes up, but that increase has nothing to do with a dividend being paid.  If you could make money buying and selling within a few days around dividend payment, every hedge fund and other investors would do that and make trillions.  There is no free lunch when it comes to dividends.

On the other hand, if you have money in a bank paying interest, you come out ahead every time interest is paid.

Dividends are more or less an accounting gimmick!

Check these out if you don't believe me.  (It is about mutual funds but is true with individual stocks, ETF's, REITS, and Mutual Funds.

I recently came across this TNDM Stock. It went down from peak $300 to as low as $5 (I think reverse split happened), now recovered to $38.

Some of the positives:

* They are the lowest mcap of all competitors like MDT, DXCM, PODD
* They floated secondary offer, got 115M and paid off their debt $94M (appx) have excess 20M for operation cash flow. This diluted shares at $28.5, but jumped to $38 now.
* Got FDA approval recently for T:Slim products, commercialization started since Aug 2018 onwards. They are able to make a software to work with DXCM products
* Year over year sales improved, and making losses, but losses getting narrowed.
* With debts removed by follow on, and having slightly excess cash for operations, there is likely turn around profit by end of this year.
* These equipment is life saving / extending category and Continuous Glucose Monitoring technology is important. Type 1 diabetes market is increasing.
* Institutional holdings are appx 62%

Some of the negatives:

* If competitors like MDT or DXCM or any other makes similar product, in next 6 months, sales may get impact.
* Even though TNDM made some break through, they are no match (in sales) against MDT , the biggest challenger
* Cash burn must be stopped by increase in sales which is one or two years away.
* Skeptical/scared because of the way it jumped from $5 to $35 (bit follow on offer was 28.5 subscribed nicely)

550,How long do you have to pay back a margin?,"I'm researching margin investing (more out of curiosity, since I'm not too experienced with investing) and I was unable to find the answer to this question:
How long do you have to pay back a margin loan? On Fidelity's [website](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/margin-loans/how-it-works), it says:
&gt;Interest charges are automatically posted to your account monthly. You determine the payback schedule and payment amount.

What I'm curious about is what this means exactly. When *do* you have to pay back your margin loan? I'm sure there's some sort of time limit (based on the institution) or people would never pay them back. What's stopping me from investing in mutual funds on margin and then holding it for 50 years? I'm sure this would beat the interest rates (Interactive Brokers is charging something like 3%, which I'm sure a mutual fund could outdo on average over the course of 50 years).",InterstellarBlue,investing

563,Thinking of Becoming a Financial Adviser and Seeking Input - Hear Me Out,"As a college student I remember going to see a fee only financial adviser with my mom. It left a bad taste in my mouth. The financial adviser had my mom in a multi-year Jackson National Life annuity and actively managed mutual funds that were front-loaded (fee charged hen purchased).

As I got more life experience, I learned about the **efficient market hypothesis** and therefore learned that **indexing** makes the most sense. Buying and holding for the long term. I came to the conclusion that a Vanguard-type index fund or **ETF** is a wise choice; or, arguably a **dozen or two of diversified stocks**.

And I also came to the conclusion that the financial manager my mom used likely only offered what he offered because: 1) He could only offer certain financial products through his organization, and they were not the right ones (he was independent but worked through LPL); 2) Multi-year annuities can ""lock-in"" the customer--he could keep getting his fee because she could not get out--there was a financial penalty to get out of the annuity too early. 3) Maybe he thought that if we knew that all we had to do was index through Vanguard maybe he would worry that we could figure it out on our own and no longer need his services.

But what I have also found out is that **even investing as simple as index funds is outside the grasp or interest of some people.** I have aunts, uncles, and friends who are clueless about these funds, how to allocate based on their age, etc. **I can see myself being a fee only financial adviser who actually looks first for clients' interest**. **I could in no way feel good about myself selling financial products that I would never buy for myself.**

I did some searching online and there are some fee-only financial advisers that simply index and allocate for the clients without long-term commitments that are common to annuities. I also imagine it will be harder going this route to make money but I was to be honest and ethical.

**If I go this route, how will I get my management fee?** I know some fee-based planners bill the clients quarterly for arrears based on assets under management, although I would prefer to have it automatically withdrawn somehow--is that possible? **Is fee-based financial planning using an indexed approach viable as a career?** Thoughts? By the way I can't stand tax and want to avoid that area as much as possible and stick with investing--I would refer to a CPA.

1. Upgrading to advanced features

4. Applying for margin approval
5. Applying for options approval
6. Using thinkorswim vs. the web interface
7. Tiers

If I upgrade to advanced features, it says I permanently lose tools / features that will no longer be available but I also gain features / tools as well. I am not sure if the tools I am losing are worth the tools I am gaining. Is it worth it? What do all of the tools do? 

I would like to invest in every asset class that TD Ameritrade has available. If possible I would like to enable everything such as futures, forex, thinkorswim, and the web interface and use them all at the same time. Is this allowed or am I only allowed to use one or the other? 

To enable futures and forex, it says I need to apply for both margin approval and options approval. I do not plan on ever borrowing money on margin to invest. I would rather use my own money. Should I decline margin trading on the application?

DELAY, DELAY, DELAY, they say.

They promise a 7-8% ""annual return.""  But it is not a true annual return.  Instead your monthly checks will be 7-8% higher if you delay collecting for a year.  The reason your Social Security check is 7-8% higher each month if you delay a year is you don't get a check while waiting. So you are not getting an investment return because there is no money given to you while you wait for benefits.

A 8% investment return would mean that you had, for example, $1000 and your investment increased 8% and now you have $1080.00.  But when you delay your social security a year, you have no base of funds to work with, so there is no real return on your investment in a traditional sense.  Your annual return while you wait is $0.  You only get a return in twenty years or so.

610,Thoughts on my retirement investing due to VWO and GXC tanking,"Hoping this sparks some good debate that can help myself and others.  Or just tell me I'm an idiot and tell me why!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My non-retirement investing is allocated to real estate (flipping houses, long-term rental properties, etc).  I am a lot more knowledgeable in this area than stock market.  So I limit my stock market investment pretty much to tax-advantaged long-term holding.  I have a financial adviser managing about 40% of my retirement funds, which are doing excellent the past year.  I am managing my other 60% currently at a loss over the past year due to the China and Emerging Markets funds I own (together these funds are about half of the value that I manage myself).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With my day job and real estate work (plus a few side businesses) I do not have time to do a ton of research and stay up on the trade wars, etc.  I simply buy low expense ETFs and mutual funds and try to diversify.  With VWO and GXC doing so poorly lately, I'm assuming I would be an idiot to sell now.  But if they are going to take years to bounce back, why wouldn't I want to sell now and get into something that will yield positive results much quicker?

620,Investing in Green/Alternate energy!,"I am finding it really difficult to invest in this area. Investing in solar specifically has so many moving parts. You have installers like Sun Run backed by Comcast,Costco, and even MLB i believe. Sounds good but the contracts they bind you to for leasing extends 20 years. Say your panels arent fitted right (Dont put out enough power) for your place you could end up paying more for electric/solar combined. 

In regard to the tariffs. They seem to have been implemented to help companies such as First Solar, yet First Solar had a recent drop of 25%, along with Canadian Solar (these are manufacturers) . I THINK this is because even though they are American, or Canadian based, their panel manufacturing is overseas (Canadian solar is anyway but they trade similarly so im thinking its the case for both). The tariff in theory was only supposed to affect the competitors of First Solar. First Solar uses a different material that is not included in the Tariff. Maybe the uncertainty of this whole thing is what drove the market down, and Tariffs just accelerated the process. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOdSmNQJfc - about tariffs. 

Another moving part is the price keeps dropping and the panels are getting more efficient. This seems great, but it cuts into profitability. Not only that, it also incentivizes people to wait and eventually own their solar panels. Which brings up a battery/storage issue. Tsla was supposed to be going after that with the powerwall. 
I will say in my findings, Owning a Solar panel seemed like the best way to go.

627,Selling My Condo to Trade/Invest,"Hello everyone,

​

I'm new to trading and would like some advice. About some background, I'm a 28 year old professional in the Toronto area. I've been saving approximately $5k a month which I'd like to allocate towards something riskier and more exciting.

​

I'll be selling my condo in Toronto (approximately $470k CAD) in January, that I currently rent out for about $2200 a month. The sharp rise in property value over the last 3 years is making me edgy and I've about $200k that I'll get back (including capital originally invested in the mortgage (\~$40k on a $305k purchase)). After the sale, I'll be allocating $150k of that towards a trading account.

​

I was wondering if it's realistic to make a steady 2-3% a month? I'm hoping to pull in about $3-6k a month consistently through shorting spreads on extended market weakness/strength or is that unrealistic?

​

My planned strategy is to trade only if I see opportunity. I'm not looking for moonshots but to grow my account slowly. I'm a huge believer in compounding wins. If I don't see any opportunity, I'll just sit on my hands.

​

My question is.. would I be better off financially just staying the course as a landlord or should I try my hand at generating income via options? I've studied financial maths in university, so I'm aware of all the strategies and terms, like IV/theta etc. I've also paper traded for about 2 months, so I know how to use a brokerage platform.

641,Pseudo-Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism,"I've been reading articles from the [Mathematical Investor blog.](https://mathinvestor.org/) A common issue they discuss is the improper use of mathematics to promote ineffective trading or investment strategies, both in academia and in industry. [Forbes has a great interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettsteenbarger/2018/05/25/the-growing-crisis-in-modern-finance/#3566607442b5) from earlier this year which covers the issue well. 

The TL;DR version is that one of the most common ways of assessing the success of a strategy is through backtesting: One looks at the historical market to determine how well the strategy would have performed in the past. Given a number of possible strategies to implement, one can then choose to use the one which performed the best over various historical periods.

Unfortunately, backtesting can be subject to [overfitting errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting), wherein the parameters in the model are finely tuned to give the best outcome _in sample_. Von Neumann once said

&gt;With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.

The authors of the blog have shown [in a more mathematical paper](http://www.ams.org/notices/201405/rnoti-p458.pdf) that this type of overfitting can be particularly bad. Not only can a strategy that worked well in sample be no better than random out of sample, it is often the case that it is _worse_ than random. That is, choosing an overfit strategy reduces your returns.

What does all of this matter? [This video](https://vimeo.com/273764593/2670602631) does a great job of describing it. Possibly false investment strategies are sold to investors under the allure that they are mathematically sound and backed up by academic research. Instead of providing good returns, they are in fact more likely to have below average returns. Thus, pseudo-mathematics is used as a form of hucksterism. 

What are peoples' thoughts on this. I see backtesting all the time when discussing strategies, particularly when discussing things like safe withdrawal rate in retirement. There are also a wealth of products based on different flavours of ""factor investing"", most of whose claims for over-performance are based on the exact sort of academic research these mathematicians are put into question. And then technical analysis is its own huge can of worms... ",inky1729,investing

Anyway,  The cool thing about stocks is you don't need a large capital to start investing.  You can literally start with 500 Dollars and take it from there depending on your comfort level.  

Let’s say for instance you are a teacher and if you invest 3K per year in stocks from the first year you started teaching,  by the time you retire you will have a nice capital waiting for you.   But I doubt a teacher early in her carrer can afford an investment home.  

In Real Estate,  Most Banks will require 20% down payment for investment loan.  So for instance if you want to purchase a 150K property,  you will need at least 30K to get started which is something most people cant afford.    There are also closing costs to pay when you purchase investment home about 2 to 3%.    During the life of the investment,  you will need to pay taxes,  hoa,  insurance,  repairs etc.   On avg,  the return is about 6 to 7%.

The Positive thing about Real Estate is the price appreciation.   You could easily resell for instance the 150K example above for 220K today lets say if you have invested about 5 years ago.     But then you need to keep in mind,  you also need to pay selling costs which would average around 8%.   The price appreciation for Real Estate can be huge but can also be average depending on several factors.   Location, condition of home,  how desirable is property etc

Investing in primary residence is also a superb idea.   You can get help from FHA with a low down payment.   But then again its all about timing.   If you have bought right after the crash,  you will be sitting on nice equity now easily 70K +.    Timing,  location and condition of property are key.

The thing that I really love about stocks is you could invest small amounts over an extended period of time and if you are patient,  it would accumulate to a really nice capital.   Apple for instance went up 231% in 5 years which is something you will not probably get in Real Estate.

Both investments are incredible but stocks imho have an advantage which is the fact you could start investing at an early age small amounts of capital.    Over a long extended time,  you will do pretty well...

648,Change My View: Index Funds are Rent Seeking,"Full disclosure: I am invested in an index fund. They represent a great way to generate acceptable returns with minimal risk.

**However**

Index funds are an inherently bad way of owning and operating companies. Index fund managers vote overwhelmingly along board recommendations due to their inability to properly vote on such a large number of companies [(Source: *Clash of Cultures*)](https://imgur.com/H59szIG.png). While it is reasonable to say that the boards will be correct in their analysis *most* of the time, it is unreasonable to say that they are correct **over 90% of the time**. No one is ever correct 90% of the time when they don't have the luxury of abstaining.

Furthermore, the idea of an index fund is to take advantage of the hard work being done by the entire industry without adding any additional value. The average stock market return is due to the entire industry competing away profits, not because the industry is inherently stupid. Without the people making lower returns squeezing profits, the most skilled investors would have no incentive to find companies that aren't correctly priced, reducing the efficiency of the entire financial system.

I understand that the average person is not equipped with the time and/or temperament to manage their own portfolio. These people should choose a manager that makes these prudent decisions on their behalf, not attempt to ""become the house"". Outsourcing control over your portfolio to the system is like outsourcing national security to an ally: it will work until the SHTF you have no idea what's going on, your leaders have even less of an idea, and you have no ability to defend yourself.

663,[Stock Discussion] GameStop - GME,"I’ve been watching GME for a couple of years now and haven’t ever managed to fully convince myself to buy in. I’d like to list out my thoughts here and get some feedback from you guys:

Pros

-GME is near the lowest it’s been since 2005, currently at $17.15/share. It bottomed out in early 2018 and has recovered slightly since. 

-Has a 8.8% dividend yield 

-Hasn’t missed earnings since 2016, and has since posted several earnings beats. 

-Revenue has held relatively stable for the last few years at approximately $9 billion

Cons

-High dividend yield could be negated by a drop in the stock price of an equal proportion

-I believe that the industry GameStop operates in will inevitably dry up as everyone just downloads games instead of purchasing them at a store. 

-The company has attempted to diversify its business into smartphone sales, but I think this was too little, too late

It shows that there has never been a twenty-thirty or forty year period where the index has not made money above and beyond inflation.  And a ten year period where the stock market has a real return loss is almost unheard of.Here are some interesting stats:

**Over a 20 year period:**

90% of the time it made at least an annualized 2.605% (Real Return)

80% of the time it made at least an annualized 3.687% (Real Return)

70% of the time it made at least an annualized  5.264% (Real Return)

60% of the time it made at least an annualized 6.812% (Real Return)

​

A real return is the amount after inflation is counted.   What does this say?  That people who are investing for the long time will always do better in the total stock market fund than having the money in bond funds or savings accounts and will always make money.  So they should stand firm and not bail out of the market during bear markets and recessions, the stock market will come back.

700,Are Money market funds useless in my situation?,"Hello,

I was considering investing my savings that I currently hold in my bank account into MMF for better interest coupled with flexible money withdrawal. However, it seems that Vanguard, Fidelity and other big MMF fund providers haven't scored better than half a percent, or in rare cases, a percent yearly interest on their MMFs. 

I have a private bank account with an average interest of 1%, and considering that I am from Czech Republic and our local MMFs (to which I could invest directly, without a discount broker) are in shambles, the only way I could invest into some interesting MMF funds abroad would be through the mentioned discount broker (patria-direct or probably degiro). And not only I would get charged money for the discount broker's services which would further strip down the earnings, but I wouldn't probably have an easy access to the MMF money as if I would invest directly.

Under these circumstances, it seems that there is no incentive for me to invest in interesting foreign MMFs. Am I right?

706,Learning to curb the psychological biases when investing,"There is this great article on how [smart people make stupid investing decisions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2012/08/16/smart-people-can-make-stupid-investing-decisions/#1ab37b5e15d5), and it says:

&gt;Investing is not a “controlled” endeavor, at least not outwardly. To succeed, one must manage chaotic markets and uncertain economies, not control them. The only “control” that’s involved is controlling one’s emotions and impulses, so that we don’t buy and sell at exactly the wrong times (see above). The fallacy here is waiting to invest until you’re “comfortable.” In today’s markets, the only time you’ll be comfortable is when markets have gone up, which means they are likely poised to go down in the near future.

And I believe that's a very good point - even not being significantly smarter than an average, I can see similar behavior in myself (willingness to invest when I feel comfortable).

The question is - is there a way to learn how to curb all this psychological biases? 

Maybe you could suggest a book to read on that?

729,Vanguard Quality/Value Factor ETFs,"Hi everyone,

I've begun investing money into my roth ira. I'm currently vested in VDAIX as I've been interested in dividend growth funds. However, I've been recently looking into factor ETFs on Vanguard.

First, I've been reading Margin of Safety and I'm interested in basically getting value from fundamentals and sitting on long term investments to yield dividend growth and appreciation from companies that may be inefficiently valued by the market. 

The value factor etf looks appealing because of the basket of companies that have relatively decent earnings over the past 5 years and a respectable ROE (without looking into other factors yet). However, reading more into Margin of Safety by Seth Karman and some of his recent thoughts, it seems that buying into value while the market has been mostly bullish and with future outlooks looking good it may not be the best idea for now to purchase 'value' equities and rather stay broadly invested in growth stocks - since I really don't plan on cherry picking winners in tech/growth fields. 

That being said, I'm kind of curious if the Quality ETF is focused on getting companies that may have better fundamentals compared to other companies in their sector while still being 'growth' stocks. Likewise, if those companies even reach a valuation that exceeds what the ETF is tracking, do those companies get sold off to basically 'sell high'?

Additionally, is the same try for the value factor? Will a company be sold if its PE grows past whatever ratio/formula/factors they use to determine a undervalued fundamentally sound company in the ETF basket? 

For my long term horizon I will be adding in international equities and bonds, likely by splitting up my portfolio by allocating a large portion of it into a target fund. But I'm curious if it'd be smart to allocate some of my money into the quality factor while markets are bullish and to then invest into the factor funds when calamity strikes or the economy takes a piss.

745,Here's a decent article from bloomberg on how arbitrary the measure of a bull market really is.,"Some quick highlights:

&gt;Several objections pertain to measurement. One is how to date the rally this one supposedly supplants -- the dot-com bubble. Traditionally, statisticians have placed the start of the tech rally in October 1990, the bottom of a slide in the S&amp;P 500 that got very close to 20 percent but not all the way. If you refuse to call that 19.92 percent drop a 20 percent drop, the advance gets longer, and today’s would need a thousand more days to exceed it.

... 
&gt;Several gripes pertains to how you calculate a 20 percent drop. Adherents of this view note that, fine, the recovery that started two months after Barack Obama took office hasn’t had a 20 percent decline when measured close to close. But it has had one when measured by the highest and lowest levels recorded during the trading day. Between May and October 2011, the S&amp;P 500 plunged 22 percent on an intraday basis. Just because it skirted the definition based on where it landed at 4 p.m. shouldn’t matter to sensible people.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-21/longest-bull-market-in-history-comes-with-jumbo-sized-asterisk

So the 19.92% drop in 1990 = bear market.  But how about the 19.3%(22% measured from intraday highs to lows) drop in 2011?  Nah, still a bull market. ",MasterCookSwag,investing

751,Tesla. Bought 100 shares at $305. Why so much hate.,"30 years old. 60% of net worth in Wealthfront/Betterment/Vanguard indexes, 15% cash, 15% stocks, 10% gold and other assets.

I own 3 stocks now (up from 2). I buy stocks to sell in my retirement (obviously if they are big short term gains I can swap out at LT gains). JNJ, Alphabet, and now Tesla.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just bought Tesla shares against the advice of what seems like everyone here.

Here are my reasons for buying:

1. Everyone I know with a Tesla says it is the best car they have ever driven in and will likely get another Tesla as their next car.
2. I would say the vast majority of people I speak to about their next car all say the same thing 'if I had the money my next car will be a Tesla'. 
3. Battery technology/production capability. I would say the odds are high that Tesla has a breakthrough innovation in the space of energy storage.
4. Home battery + solar systems is the future of the energy grid. 
5. Has anyone driven in a Ford/GM lately. They are literally JUNK on wheels. Plus the debt, legacy costs these companies carry. German/Japanese/Korean auto manufactures are good quality, but they lack either the technology innovation (electric/self-driving), or are anchored down by legacy. They can't compete with Tesla on the dealership model.
6. Smart people work at Tesla. I can't tell you how many times I meet someone who would have trouble putting a square peg through a square hole, then find out they work at a Fortune 500 (in a senior position). I've met two Tesla employees and they were very impressive. Same experience with Google.
7. Oil, environmental regulation (maybe no batteries) resistant. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I feel like Tesla created the future car like Apple created the iPhone 12 years ago.** 

I'm not saying Elon doesn't have problems. But between SpaceX and Tesla, no one can deny he is a visionary who surrounds himself with people who can execute. 

I literally hear CNBC talking about how GM is a better buy because their self-driving unit has X valuation, blah, blah and I GUARANTEE you non of the people saying this drive a GM.

In 12 years from now, this company is either going to be a $1TT market cap company, or won't exist, but at $50BB marketcap, the upside is so worth the risk. I look at it like spinning a roulette wheel with a 30% chance for a 20-1 payout.

I think the risk vs. upside calculation on Tesla is a no-brainer. I feel like if you look forward 12 years from the iPhone launch to today, GM/Ford/Chrysler are all headed the way Nokia and Motorola are. To irrelevance while they maintain their 8 year old combustion engine product lines with legacy cost and aging mechanics.

759,Thoughts on TEUM - They have secured a huge amount of contracts lately,"Hey was wondering everybody's thoughts on TEUM I have made money off this stock before and have since started another position on it again. They have secured a lot of new contracts over the last few months - it has been so good that they are boasting a + $301 million dollar 36 month revenue backlog of contracts.  


They also had a great ER beat which saw a nice spike for the co. however did fall back down in the coming days. The price is slowly growing and there have been some nice spikes so was just wondering what other people thought about this stock. They have nice looking financials.  


I thought there would be more hype over $301 million in backlogged contracts or am I missing something here, is this not as good as it seems in the stock world? It would lead me to believe that they have good tech + a are a respected company however the stock price hasn't shot up that much.

The market started rising in 2008 when the fed started increasing their balance sheet. In Dec 2017 they started decreasing their balance sheet and reducing the amount of cash in the market. 

What do you all think? Less cash in the market should decrease asset prices, but so far the stock market has been on fire. Does this mean we're in a mania and have yet to see the full extent of a dramatic price increase? Or do you think higher prices are justified?

The question I have is, is this [website](https://shareholder.broadridge.com/disneyinvestor/) a legit website to get stock from, and would it actually be my stock, or technically owned by this website? (I don’t want them claiming ownership over it and taking it or using it for their gain if that  makes sense) and if not where should I go? 

Oh and also if it is a legit site is it a good place to go? Or should I pick another place to go through that may be better?

 I’m super new to all this and I’m only 19, but I’m very interested in investing. I’m planning on becoming a teacher and teachers don’t make much so I’m looking for other alternatives for the future, and while investing in Disney’s stock now may not necessarily help me, it’s a good place to start! 

I currently have an IRA and a acorns investment account (I know it barely counts as investing but it’s somewhere to put some extra money) any help and suggestions for me to get some Disney stock now (and hopefully buy more in the future) would be super helpful and help me get to a good place.

How do I proceed?","I'm trying to get advice on how I can get a third party involved to be sure that Vanguard returns shares to me that they've mistakenly deleted. This has been a pretty long process and I'm losing faith that they are going to make it right.

2 weeks ago I started an ETF conversion, and while the person on the phone took down the order properly, it was not executed properly. Essentially ~150 shares of VTIAX and ~70 shares of VTSAX were to be converted to their ETF counterpart.

As it stands I am missing ~300 shares of VTIAX (also from the wrong lot, messing up my cost basis), and the correct ~70 shares of VTSAX. 

~150 shares were properly converted to VXUS from VTIAX, but ~150 have simply disappeared. The ~70 shares of VTSAX were properly converted to VTI, but about 3 days afterwards they were deleted as well without returning the shares to VTSAX.

It's been 2 weeks, and today Vanguard told me there's a problem with their system and they may have more information for me in 2 more weeks. The original time I was quoted for this ETF conversion was 3 business days. I'm losing faith in Vanguard's ability to sort this out without external motivation. Would FINRA be the right place to start?

&gt;Much of the language of JEDI, in fact, seems specifically tailored for  Jeff Bezos. “Everybody immediately knew that it was for Amazon,” says a  rival bidder who asked not to be named. To even make a bid, a provider  must maintain a distance of at least 150 miles between its data centers,  a prerequisite that only Amazon can currently meet. JEDI also asks for  “32 GB of RAM”—the precise specification of Amazon’s services.  (Microsoft, by contrast, offers only 28 GB, and Google provides 30 GB.)  In places, JEDI echoes Amazon’s own language: It calls for a  “ruggedized” storage system, the same word Amazon uses to tout its  Snowball Edge product.

830,Dividend Growth Stock Investing,"Some companies like KO or SJM have a history of increasing dividend rates. Buffett and others (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/user/ppcian) use a strategy of taking advantage of these dividend increases to achieve cash flows in the 20-30% range after a number of years. 

My question is on how this works. If I buy $1000 worth of KO shares now and buy an additional $1000 every subsequent year, what effective dividend rate will I achieve? Will all of these positions see the same dividend growth rate (assuming KO increases dividend each year)? Or will my staggered buying scheme only have the earliest purchases all seeing the dividend increases?

831,Expense Ratios With Closed End Funds,"Hoping some of you fine people can help provide some clarity on one of the recommendations made towards the end of the book *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*. Basically the author makes the recommendation that if a discount of 10% or more in the price relative to the NAV exists on a closed end fund, then this would make it a more attractive buy than a similar open end index fund. Browsing through some emerging market closed end funds (the author makes a point that this sort of discount is more easily found in the international space) on my brokerage website, I can see several different funds selling at a 10% or greater discount. However when I look to the expense ratios on these funds, the majority are over 1% and many are over 1.5%. My questions is how would you decide when the discount more than makes up for this greatly increased ER, which is often 2-4X as high as similar ETFs and mutual funds in the open end space? At what point does the increased ER outweigh any benefit of buying at a discount relative to NAV? I feel like I have been conditioned to look at nothing but ER and when I see them this high I cringe, but I do not think the author would make this kind of recommendation if it did not have any merit so I want to hear some opinions.

TLDR ER is much higher on average close end fund, how do you decide when they are attractive in spite of this?",Shrewligi,investing

Also, the target date funds can be used anytime once I hit 59-1/2 correct?  The date of the fund (2045 vs 2055 for example) is just a means of calculating when they start moving to bonds, correct?  That has nothing to do with when I can start withdrawing?",Antiwraith,investing

I have several positions that I've added to over several years and up until last week (after I ""upgraded"" a margin account) if I clicked on a ticker symbol I owned in my portfolio page, it would expand on that symbol and show them broken down by individual orders - so lets say I own 33 shares of VTI, if I clicked on VTI, it would show the 3 shares I bought last month, the 10 shares, I bought the month before, and the 20 shares I bought the month before that... Now it doesn't do that. If I click on VTI, it just shows 33 shares and the date acquired shows the date of my last purchase... in addition, when I go to sell shares, I used to be able to pick the individual lots that I wanted to sell from...now, it no longer gives me that option.

So I have trouble fathoming how you can make that kind of money on a great stock pick if your not wagering a sizable sum of capital.

The majority of my RSUs vested in the last 12 months when my company was still private. Since the company was private, I was unable to follow the typical advice of selling immediately after vesting.

In the time between vesting &amp; IPO, they incurred substantial capital gains - almost all of which would be taxed as short-term. In total, the RSUs will represent about half my current net worth.

I’m having a hard time deciding between these options:

1. Selling all of the RSUs now to get the money into index funds. Seems safer, especially given the proportion of my portfolio they represent. This would entail accepting the short-term capital gains hit (about 30k more than the long-term rate).

2. Selling the RSUs progressively over the next year as they qualify for long-term treatment. This seemingly offers a ‘guaranteed’ 15% return (from the lower tax rate), but obviously places a large percentage of my portfolio in a single stock.

3. Some combination of the above - selling a portion at short-term, and selling the rest progressively as it qualifies for long-term.

888,The Idea of Beta in Financial Models and Perception on Risk,"I was wondering about the main argument on why a lot of the academics and investors use beta in financial models. You can see in a lot of course material even from online courses or the teachers of Aswath Damodoran that they use a risk free rate something. If you analyze their financial models (DCFs), they incorporate beta and use it as a risk and discount measure. A lot of things like CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) utilize it too. So, just wondering, does anyone use beta, CAPM or side with the academics with financial modelling? Does anyone use beta, CAPM, and a risk free rate or whatever? What is your main reasoning or logic behind? Do you think Buffett is wrong on this  situation of risk? Please share what type of models you guys use as well (DCF, EPV etc.)?

889,"My guesses about the next recession, your thoughts?","1. This recession won’t be as impactful as the last one, even though it will impact overvalued stocks. You hear a lot about how people are just holding cash because of how long the bull market has been going on, and once a recession hits people will start piling back in. 

2. This recession will be a short one time-wise. Everyone I know took their money out of the market and got back in later, (probably in 2011-2012) and I’ve heard a lot of stories on here about how people would think you were crazy for averaging down. In my opinion, a ton of  people will consistently average down knowing that it will help them in the long run. 

I don’t know when the next recession will happen, or what the cause will be. Buying now is the perfect time. ",cpayne_10,investing

894,Is physical Real Estate Investing really that great an investment?,"Buying real estate is really cash intensive with higher than average expenses. I hope this sparks a great discussion.

At best you have no HOA, a no property tax, no to low maintenance, and that leaves the growth/performance.

At worst, you have an HOA hurdle, property taxes, and some maintenance, all of which can push your annual expense ratio up towards 3%! If offered a mutual fund with a 3% expense ratio, most would balk!

Even without any debt against the house, real estate seems to price inversely proportionally to interest rates. Like an existing bond trading below par when rates rise.

So what makes physical real estate more attractive than an investment portfolio.

Some people have a just ""real estate only"" mentality but it seems most indexes show real estate performance around 10% long term, does that count the property taxes and HOAs and taxes on gains and rent being taxable as well?",blahblahblahinfo,investing

900,Is COMMERCIAL real estate a better investment than residential?,"I’m kind of piggybacking off this thread that asks if real estate is better than stock investing but no one really addressed commercial: http://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9894p3/is_physical_real_estate_investing_really_that/

I’m looking at potentially buying or renting a commercial property somewhere in the $1-2 million dollar range and it might have another tenant in the building.  Think long standing furniture store on the bottom and my small business on the top. 

After reading most of the thread above, everyone was arguing about HOS fees, property upkeep, closing costs, taxes, etc etc. I can only imagine the headaches that come with renting to college kids, multi families, etc but when I think of renting a commercial space, it doesn’t seem that risky and that big of a headache.

Every job I’ve worked at, the commercial landlord only really took care of the external building and landscaping, and parking.  In many cases, with NNN triple net leases, the companies leasing the property would spend their own money redesigning and outfitting the internal space.  The commercial property owner never had to do any major renovations because the renter would do that (excluding the shell of the building).  

Anyways, does anyone have an opinion on buying commercial real estate vs residential? As a young investor, I still favor the stock market but this will be my first time venturing into buying or renting a commercial space. ",phaskellhall,investing

907,2 short questions about company privatization,"Hello

I read [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/public-companies-privatize-go-private.asp) about privatization of public companies. The relevant part of the article is this:

    a company borrows someone else's money to buy the company, pays the interest on that loan with the cash 
    generated from the newly purchased company, and eventually pays off the balance of the loan with a portion of the
    company's appreciation in value. The rest of the cash flow and appreciation in value can be returned to investors as 
    income and capital gains on their investment (after the private-equity firm takes its cut of the management fees).

I now have a few question:

1) Suppose you were to have a certain number of shares in Tesla at the moment they are going private.
   If I understood it correctly they will buy your share. Can I refuse their offer? Can I just keep my share although they want ot go private?

2) They state that they pay the interest with the cash generated from the purchased company. I don't see how that's possible. They make it sound like the act of buying the company generates money. Don't they mean `ays the interest on that loan with the cash generated **BY** the newly purchased company` which implies that the company for instance sold much more of their product for some reason; they had bigger revenues. 

Could somebody explain this?

Who is going to bail out Turkey, and how will a hard landing affect global markets differently?","So I just thought of something / realized something rather basic. There have been a lot of comparison between Turkey and Greece recently with both countries experiencing some huge currency issues. Both countries at similar points are looking towards hard landings, yet Greece was helped by being ""bailed out"" by the EU. While this was far from an ideal bailout, it at least was able to put a stopgap on further contagion. 

But we're completely overlooking the basic fact that Greece had a backer to bail them out when they got in trouble. Who in the world is going to bail out Turkey? Qatar gave them 15 billion recently, but that's not going to be enough to make any major difference in the long run, and I have to imagine the very difficult political situation Erdogan has placed himself in along with threatening US sanctions may make things far worse in finding a suitor capable of a full on bail-out. 

I'm not saying that Turkey can't be bailed out or won't, but I think it's at least worth considering the effects of a true hard landing vs. a bail-out soft landing like Greece. Additionally, S&amp;P recently just stated that they foresee a hard landing for Turkey, so I think this is a pretty important item that is getting overlooked here.",cbus20122,investing

941,Simple Tax Question,"**ANSWERED: it works like income taxation, with the higher rate kicking in only on capital gains over the threshold.**

For long term capital gains taxes, there is a cutoff at $426,700 of taxable income for a single filer at which the rate increases from 15 to 20%.  This seems simple and I think that I get this.  There is also a 3.8% tax associated with Obamacare which increases those rates to 18.8%/23.8%.  That also seems simple.

My question is as follows:  Does the higher rate kick in for capital gains above the $427k threshold or does it apply to all capital gains for that tax year when triggered?  For the sake of an example, let's assume a pretax income of $270k.  Let us also assume the sale of $750k in common stock with $600k as capital gains.  All gains are long term.   Would this individual realize an overall tax savings by structuring the sale of securities (we'll assume that the share price is essentially flat for the sake of simplicity). so that only (427-270=)$157k fell in one tax year and selling the remainder in the following tax year?  Or, alternately, if the increased rate applies only to income above the $427k threshold, then as long as the example investor sold shares worth at least $157k of capital gains in both years, then they would minimize tax losses regardless of the amount of capital gains realized in each year.

Basically, I want to know if long term capital gains tax brackets work like income tax brackets.",amschind,investing

944,Anton Kreil: How A Rat Disguised Himself as a Cat,"An article I've written after doing a lot of research about an ""Investment Guru"" My friend has fallen prey to

“Investment porn” is a term used to refer to images, videos and other depictions of lavish wealth used by a seller of Finance products and courses to create an aura of credibility around their claims of granting financial success. Perhaps the most notorious among these wealth pimps is Tai Lopez, who gained widespread infamy after flooding youtube Ads with videos of him hawking his “Knowlege” among props from his “lavish lifestyle”. He is by no means alone with a multitude of other “Gurus” such as Tim Skyes and Ramit Sethi selling the same stuff. Anton Kreil’s prime method of marketing seems to be high production value videos where interspaced with almost casual demonstrations of extravagance he claims to give “Life” advice. What makes Kreil unique among others of the same ilk is that he seems to have an almost pathological dislike for other of the same time, calling Skyes an “Total BS Artist.” and produces videos where he “Annihilates Retail Brokers and Trading Educators”. All of which is correct but is simply more proof that the old adage about “One’s Enemies enemy being one’s friend” wrong.

His videos are a half-stepped more refined compared to his contemporaries, matching his un-emphasized British accent, instead of Sports Cars and Bikin-Clad Girls he shows expensive shaves and chauffeur drive airport rides. He avoids the large numbers other videos indulge in preferring to let the luxuries flow in a sort of uninterrupted smoothness instead of shoving them at the Camera. His rise to prominence illustrates this principle quite nicely, instead of shady internet ads he used BBC-Affiliated Reality Tv appearing in Million Dollar Traders. The half-act he plays hasn’t fooled everybody as many others have pointed out but has been enough to convince a few hundred fools interspaced with brainwashed cultists to part with $3,000 in exchange for a subscription his “video” course while a few dozen more have dropped five figures on his mentoring options.

To rebut his content requires repeating what is now the tired formula for debunking investment gurus, a Bloomberg terminal search reveals that he does indeed possess work experience in hedge funds but his badly written website claims of being a “Top Trader” remain unverified and probably unverifiable. The obvious argument of his reasoning for teaching instead of making millions trading prompts the absurd counter that it is a charity effort followed by even more absurd arguments once the high price of his courses is pointed out.

I would under an ordinary course ignore such a figure, my writings most likely to be ignored by those in need of it, but given his attempts to disguise himself as a scam-fighter I feel obligated to write against. Previous rebuttals have ignored this characterization and despite the inherent absurdity of the defence, it’s widely used by those who have paid him in an attempt to justify their own expenditure.  His attempts to promote himself and his own scams by taking down other’s is despicable and deserves to be highlighted.",Hurt_cow,investing

961,Your true break even date for Social Security is based on the investment return of your assets,"Every is talking about how the break even date for taking Social Security early is about 78 years old.  This is younger than the median age of death for someone who has lived to 65.  According to the latest studies, a man has a 50-50 chance to make it to 82 and a woman has a 50-50 chance to make it to 85-- IF THEY LIVE FIRST TO 65.

So, if you take Social Security at 62 your break even date is before the date you have a 50-50 chance of living to.  Your lose, right?

Well not exactly.  What is missing from most analysis of the break even date of early Social Security for people who retire early, is the cost of taking money OUT OF your investment accounts (401k, 403B, IRA and Mutual Funds) to make up for the missing Social Security Checks. (If you retire at 62 but don't collect SS until later.)

How much do you expect to get from a typical balanced portfolio on average in 20-30 years?

If your investment return average (CAGR)  in your retirement accounts is:

4% nominal- then your break even date is 82

5% nominal- then your break even date is 84

6% nominal- then your break even date is 86

7% nominal- then your break even date is 89

8% nominal- then your break even date is 94

9% nominal- then your break even date is 97

all assume a 2% annual SS COLA.

(I am thinking that if we don't get at least a five percent nominal return in the next 20-30 years from a balanced portfolio of 60-40, our economy is in trouble.  Subtract 3% from these figures for a real return.)
